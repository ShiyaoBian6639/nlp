399,"I want to call someone out for being racist and have people go like, yeah I get you."
400,The clarity of what is a racist has no necessarily relationship with intention being a requirement.
401,"If the criteria you are going by is people ""*getting you*"", then the essential question is only whether they share a common understanding of racism as you."
402,"In this regard, if everyone in Singapore agreed that unintentional acts can be racist, then there would be lack of clarity."
403,With regards to those who are calling the silent out**   I’m sure many of us have come across posts saying/implying “your silence = racism”.
404,"A lot of them are also well aware of the irony of speaking out for BLM while staying largely silent or inactive on social injustices, racism and oppression being faced at home."
405,I realise that it is true that I have been largely more vocal on social media about BLM than about the injustices being faced by migrant workers here/casual racism faced in Singapore/other societal issues being faced here.

439,"---  **Things To Do/Nightlife/People**  I will know absolutely no one aside from my coworkers, are there any good expat communities or arcades or game centers or just places where people hang out that you can go to alone and make some friends?"
440,"**Recommendation:**   While I understand that there is a public demand to punish dormitory operators for their profit-maximising policies that led to the worsening of the current situation, this is something that would have to be postponed until after the situation is controlled."
441,"* Let the public know that the foreign workers are essential at this time, and that now is not the time to enact punitive measures on private dormitory operators."
442,"While I'm very, very pissed off at the influx of foreigners, my anger is more directed to the immigration policy."
443,"By doing this, it would have pointed straight back to the failures of PAP's immigration policy and their failure to improve the infrastructure to accommodate the massive influx of foreigners."
444,"**TLDR: I disagree with most aspects of the arguments from the Critical Spectator poster (henceforth ""CS guy"") but I believe that this reasoning doesn't make him a racist."
445,"**  The word ""racist"" has been too frequently used as an end-all counterargument that it has lost its powerful original meaning."
446,A racist is someone who deems his ethnicity to be superior to other ethnicities and acts based on this belief.
447,"A racist is an asshole by default, but the reverse is not necessarily true: you can be an inconsiderate, unsympathetic and uncompassionate idiot (like the CS guy) and **not** be a racist."
448,"On the economic reason - I don't see any statistically significant reduction in housing prices in areas with dense foreign worker population (Little India, Jalan Besar, Bencoolen)."
449,"In addition, the CS guy peppered his post with various unfounded, sometimes asinine assumptions: that people anywhere hate living next to ""social housing"", that migrant men want to ""hook up with maid girlfriends"", that the dorms would take up spaces that otherwise would be used to make parks and pools, etc."
450,But - and this is a big but - those arguments don't make him a racist.
451,"By simply calling him a racist without taking on his arguments directly you won't change his opinion; rather, he will simply see you as a virtue-signalling SJW and the discussion will ground to a halt."
452,"If we want to have a conversation with somebody like the CS guy and influence the public discourse, let's avoid loaded terms like ""racist"", ""xenophobic"", etc unless they are really called for."
453,"**The cost of hiring** new Indonesian maids to cost up to $3,000 more"
454,"**VTL flight capacity also cut by half post-Jan 20th,** that's another huge blow also that is getting overlooked."
455,"** Should the clusters in such locations grow, the strain on our healthcare system will also grow much heavier, compared to if there were a cluster comprising mostly younger, healthier people such as in a secondary school or migrant worker dormitory."
456,"Depictions may include demanding to ""speak to the manager"", being racist or sporting a particular bob cut hairstyle."
457,**[Special Assistance Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Assistance_Plan)**     >The Special Assistance Plan (Abbreviation: SAP; Chinese: 特别辅助计划) is a programme in Singapore introduced in 1979 which caters to academically strong students who excel in both their mother tongue as well as English.
458,"In a SAP school, several subjects may be taught in the mother tongue, alongside other subjects which are taught in English."
459,"Currently SAP schools only cater to those studying the Mandarin mother tongue, although theoretically, future SAP schools for other mother tongues are a possibility."
460,"**[Syrians_in_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrians_in_Germany)**     >Syrians in Germany refers to Syrian immigrants to Germany, as well as their descendants."
461,"*But cash salaries for expatriates here remain the fifth highest globally, according to a survey published by data and knowledge provider ECA International on Wednesday (Aug 25)."
462,"*Dr Chua felt that the longer-term implications from stricter foreign worker policies will be weaker potential GDP growth, job creation and fiscal revenue."
463,The so called experts keep on talking about impacts from less foreign workers but how long we can rely on cheap labour?
464,2020 was bad because of the huge outbreak in dormitories among migrant workers which could be contained by locking down albeit with a lot of resources.
465,"*Insert ""[Minority race] can't be racist!"
466,"And honestly...if there’s any good place to get Coronavirus and receive treatment, I know I would prefer SG to most of those migrant worker’s home country."
467,"There is a reliance on domestic helpers to make up for this, something which I do not find healthy."
468,"Maybe I should be disqualified from posting in this thread about ""Singaporeans abroad having experiences with racism"", because I experienced racism abroad, which made me biased against the racists?"

471,It’s really hard for foreigners to understand and you should watch Brit expats Georgia Caney (https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCHPGZALZrKIB2SNVF9BQpwg) to find out more.
472,"- Although you won't have the racism cases that caused BLM in the US, be prepared to some mild racism and a lot of micro aggressions."
473,"They still have a long way to go identifying and fighting this racism, but I insist this will never escalate to physical violence and it's not that frequent."
474,- Casual racism when using certain words with Chinese privilege that rings poorly amongst the targeted race.
475,"However, Ms Sarah has shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”."
476,She characterised this incident as “racist”.
477,"In her interview with Walid J. Abdullah, she also insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”."
478,"While the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist."
479,"It is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments."
480,> >Is it racist to assume particular race will cause wear and tear?
481,Everything you just described is racist.
482,Because it's immoral and racist.
483,"... and yet, people still insist it’s the foreign workers making life worse for local singaporeans, and not, the capitalists and employers running the system."
484,"... your reflective-racism is showing, dude."
485,......so your stand is that racists shouldn't be downvoted?
486,"Anyway, seeing that word and the maid abuse case is not good for my heart."
487,....and how does this lead to increased racism?
488,"The perspective on the maid is that she, too, is being 'left behind in a trail of dust' for not standing up for herself."
489,"Heck, might as well go all in and elect Amos Yee as president and start building walls around Singapore to stop immigrants from coming."
490,There’s no doubt that racism exists in Singapore.
491,"However, the level racism vastly differs than that of America’s."
492,We definitely need to tackle racism for the betterment of our society but that doesn’t mean we should be trigger-happy about everything.
493,"Covid cases wont go back down at this point, 80% of people vaccinated, all of the foreign workers vaccinated and regularly tested."
494,My life would have been radically different without a mandatory mother tongue.
495,I'm not liguistically talented and I never spoke my 'mother tongue' (mandarin) at home.
496,Mandatory mother tongue was the bane of my school existence and was the primary driver for my parents uprooting me and my brother and migrating to Australia.
497,"Mandatory mother tongue cripples those who aren't language gifted/sufficiently exposed to it, and i think that's a crazy disadvantage."
498,"""average sinkies"" from being bad to maids  this was trashmaker's understanding when he made his first reply to you  since you asked people to try and correct your english, that's what i did"
499,"..but it's a common thing, and it's relevant to the topic at hand (maids and foreign workers in dorms, both of which are mostly from those countries)."
500,I don't see how this could be portrayed as racist at all.
501,Runner-up – “We needed the foreign workers as additional wind in our sails when the weather is good.” - A good analogy from Dr Vivian Balakrishnan to create a soothing image on a volatile and sensitive topic.
502,"//Resale units in hot neighbourhoods minorities may not be able to afford it (Go look at the private market to see an example)//  Can I say the above statement is racist, because this assume that minority cannot afford more expensive housing?"
503,"/r/UnpopularOpinion /r/UnpopularFact  Singapore’s Daily Infection Case Count [**DICC**] will continue to break new record till all 3XX,XXX FWs [source: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers] in **all** 43 licenced FDWs are screened & swabbed, followed by isolation & quarantine of infected FWs who reside in these FWDs."
504,/r/workreform is the new sub  Edit: [the mods there may be right wing racists.
505,/u/SirPalat for your reading pleasure on why your earlier analysis on CECA is not robust enough.
506,Let's be honest - very few Singaporeans are willing to do the jobs that these foreign workers do.
507,2 is now however physically impossible due to travel restrictions.
508,"2) This is the point I am making - we are having a discussion on a scope of racism, and so these taxonomic groups have no principled basis."
509,Your original point of using a taxonomical argument to explain why we should not have a comparison to crime is really a non-argument since it assumes a particular scope of racism (which is the point of controversy).
510,"6) In the same vein, I can tell you that a person is racist."
511,"I can further tell you that a person is intentionally or unintentionally racist, specifying my point."
512,1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing.
513,Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.
514,How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce?
515,I only recently realised how much I've internalised the racism when I reflected back on my actions in the past.
516,I am merely a foreign worker here.
517,"LGBT and migrant worker rights; better social nets for the unemployed, disabled or mentally ill)."
518,"Bear in mind it isn't the position of the agency (that released the tender) to care about things like the welfare of the foreign workers, but rather, that of MOM."
519,"1) It'd probably help, but I'm sure you could also find some people just about racist enough to not give a shit how nice you smell."
520,"2) A Chinese or more broadly an East Asian income gap exists in a lot of countries, so we can't fully blame ""Mandarin only"" job discrimination or racism for the alleged income gap."
521,Perhaps its the immigrant effect?
522,"/shrug  TLDR: We cant blame all of it on Chinese racism, but its probably not because the Malays are ""lazy"" either."
523,"1) Not expat, so can't help you with the taxes  2) Some costs may not include utilities (e.g wifi) or other creature comforts (e.g aircon) so always ask if it includes those things."
524,"1) On your formulation of racism (intentional only)  Yes, the joke would be intentional since I was expressly referring to ""your formulation"" of racism."
525,"If under your formulation everyone is a racist but you still need to determine who is ""worse"", this is essentially the same mental exercise as what you complain about when you say ""*Now I wonder if someone who’s called racist, is some sort of skinhead, or Ah Tan down the road who wrinkled his nose at an unfamiliar perfume*.""."
526,"Assuming we applied your formulation, the sentence would simply be ""*Now I wonder if someone who's called racist, is it some sort of racist joker or Hitler""**."
527,"*   Under either system (intentional acts only, all acts included), the term ""racist"" is still going to encompass a large category of people, and you still have to under go a second mental exercise of finding who is worse."
528,"Even with your latest comment, the reverse is also true - crime can be racism, but crime does not represent all racism."
529,"3) On intent  Xenophobia, speciesism, Luddite mantles are all interesting topics to discuss, but the short answer to your question ""*If not, then why does the unintended consequence of a racial discrimination incur the title of racism*?"""
530,"1) They are barbaric not because they keep their passports, but because of the way foreign workers are treated in the gulf states."
531,"Would you as a parent, want to keep an unwilling maid in your house?"
532,Or would you just go to the agency and change a maid?
533,"In the construction, shipping and industrial sectors, a lot of foreign workers are abused, and passports withheld because of unscrupulous employers."
534,"The domestic helper sector, however, is different."
535,"11) Nope, you can look for a job here without an employment pass."
536,No difference as expat.
537,70% of enlistees at HTA & NSTI are brown despite them being only 10% of the population 3) SAP schools (including primary schools) that receive huge amounts of funding from the government for the Chinese people...by the Chinese people  With such a large proportion of the Chinese community actually able to go through the first 18-19 years of their lives in (top) school(s) without knowing a single member of a minority...should we really be surprised at the racism still happening?
538,"Mind you, these people also form the top of the Chinese cohort and will be our leaders of tomorrow...policy makers  I don’t think it’s gna go away in a few generations when the gov itself is still the proponent of so many racist policies"
539,improving the living standards of transient workers is also a difficult and complicated issue.
540,2) All hospitalizations of foreign workers are paid for by the government.
541,The government is also covering salaries and living expenses of the foreign workers while they are in lockdown.
542,"I think there have not been serious conditions among the foreign workers because majority of them are young, healthy and active males."
543,"2) to be honest, my most racist experience was actually during my trip in Singapore to renounce my citizenship (lol)."
544,Just because it's us vs them doesn't mean we aren't racist in Singapore.
545,"In Australia, at least, there are laws protecting people from racism, and equal amounts of people protecting others from racism."
546,"It takes a lot to offend/humiliate me these days, and if there's any racist connotations these days, I either try to educate or walk away depending on the situation."
547,"1) your maid can't unilaterally renew the contract, that's not how such contracts work."
548,3) my family has a long term domestic worker who can similarly be difficult at (very rare) times.
549,"1)The accusation is false to begin with, CECA doesn't allow unlimited number of Indian nationals into SG  2)Similar clause can be found in other FTAs like the one we have with NZ don't see that complaining about that one"
550,"""An expatriate (often shortened to expat) is a person temporarily or permanently residing, as an immigrant, in a country other than that of their citizenship."""
551,*genes* from their parents who were affected by my 2nd point - diet 2. boobs and asses are made of *fats* - which is a result of diet: curry chicken (not being racist here) and all
552,Sarah didn’t call the incident racist.
553,Actually I didn’t see anyone calling PA racist.
554,Don't have a language test or provide clear reasons why PR are approved or denied.
555,"However, if the judge flips the records and found that this fella has 5 police reports made on him for racist or unnecessary remarks during lessons and the employer miraculously still employs him without taking action, then both him and his company shall be liable."
556,VTLs.
557,These are great to open up but it's really kinda lame to just do only that and not have a plan to move further up or **at least try to show that there is more to it than just VTLs?
558,This has been used by the xenophobic and clueless to claim it suppress wages.
559,I find hiring maids like modern slave labor too.
560,I don't mind Angmohs being racist because I look like obviously a different race.
561,"But i find Singaporean chinese being racist a problem because my ""difference"" is not physical (I gave myself an english name when applying for jobs), they got to know me enough and they were NICE until the point when they peek at my NRIC and realize that hey, i'm born in china, and then spread it around the whole dept, and people purposely asking me annoying qns like -why did you come to Singapore?"
562,The fact that participants assumed these characteristics of the applicants is a reflection of their racist attitudes.
563,Isnt that the definition of racism?
564,"We can spew rhetorics about for 10,000 years about how you think tech could magically cut down the amount of foreign worker necessary by half so we suddenly only need to cram 6 instead of 12 to a room, but clustering was never an issue until today and it was necessary for the foreign workforce."
565,"In theory, the VTL works on a country basis."
566,It's not racism against non Chinese as she claims.
567,Because we shouldn't ignore the fact that the maid did this out of some degree of desperation (doesn't make it right).
568,"It simply reinforces the perspective that FDWs have inadequate protections with regards to their rights; perhaps all of us shouldn't have the privilege of domestic help if some of us cannot be responsible (see for example, chewing gum)."
569,Generally the expats seem to like the East (Marine Parade/East Coast) or the Holland Village area.
570,Also due to increase of immigrants from other ethnicities.
571,What is the link between employers abusing their maids vs. whether one should hire a maid?
572,"if someone needs a maid and is going to treat her well, why should the stories of abuse affect the decision to hire one?"
573,They have thrown the VTL out of the window and are quarantining entire flights if ONE person had omicron on it.
574,The countries from which we get our foreign labor/foreign talent do not necessarily reciprocate.
575,"If wanting restrictions on immigration is xenophobic, then China is xenophobic, Germany is xenophobic (towards non-EU nationals), India is xenophobic, Taiwan is xenophobic, the US is xenophobic, the UK is xenophobic, etc."
576,"Honestly, just from these two points, I wouldn't accuse them of racism JUST YET."
577,"I wouldn't use the racism card for this one too, based on what we know, because for all we know, those two were just not good at speaking English (Prima Deli does have a lot of China workers)."
578,Not that I am denying racism isn't in Singapore.
579,"The foreign worker willingly chose to come here, its a pay for labour contract."
580,Best description of singapore is an immigrant's country.
581,"Tons of foreigners come to Singapore every year, so there is a huge market for expat rentals."
582,It's also popular among Canadian expats since the Canadian international school is located there too.
583,Most bars and clubs on weekends tend to be expat dominated.
584,"In addition to what the maid was charged with, there are offences of lying in court, giving false evidence, and so on."
585,"Hence, all the more serious false statement offences under the Penal Code are not really appropriate - the maid has not lied in court, nor has she given false evidence under oath."
586,There seems to also be a range of other mitigating factors for the maid.
587,"Weirdly enough it was the wife that brought issue to the police, so I'm not sure how much influence the wife had on the maid giving the statement."
588,"Very easy to counter, maid agencies can just advertise that their maids are **trained** and employers will just flock there."
589,"Unless you want maids to undercut each other because there is no set price, this is probably not a good idea to stop regulation."
590,"Without regulation maids may also end up getting scammed with bad contracts (say a clause for penalty if maid leaves before term is up, which can be done to farm money from them)."
591,"), then set a bigger cut from the monthly salary by reducing the cut given to the maid per month."
592,"There, maid ends up paying."
593,"Also, if they are forced to increase price, employers may end up demanding more time/quality/work done from the maids as they 'had paid more',  which can lead to more abuses."
594,"These issues needs to be solved with regulation, specifically a hard cap on the number of hours a maid can work and a clear definition of what constitutes break/work time."
595,"Of course, they could be racists."
596,"Ya very racist, every time you visit an Indian stall, you must balance out by visiting a Chinese stall and an European stall and a Malay stall."
597,"We don't know, because the details of the Singapore/Malaysia VTL scheme have not been released yet."
598,"Currently the Europe VTLs permit travel to any VTL country, but the South Korea and Australia ones do not."
599,"Maybe Sg shares data with the EU, maybe they check your bag and find a receipt from a non-VTL country, maybe they check your phone and find photos of a non-VTL country, etc."
600,"All that said, I think it's a matter of time until VTLs expand to cover the entire EU, or at least the Category II countries."
601,And they'll eventually ditch the entire VTL flight concept and just accept all vaccinated travellers on any flight.
602,Singaporeans attitudes towards foreign workers made it possible for Govt and employers to undercut the foreign workers because not enough of us placed pressure to get their lives better.
603,The fact that she doubled down and said she wasn’t being racist made it clear that she doesn’t understand why what she did was being racially insensitive
604,"I hope the KR govt can allow VTL travellers to do their in-Korea tests at public health centers as well which are more accessible (right now, you must go to only designated clinics), but since that is still a WIP i would say yes milelion has it basically covered."
605,You are telling people (the couple) that you do not approve of **their** choice - racist 2.
606,"For #1 and #2 to be the same, you would have to tell an Indian guy he's racist because he won't date a Chinese girl."
607,The rest are probably relieved that the infection ballooned in a migrant worker dorm where they could be shut in/distanced from the rest of the population and that it had little impact on Singaporeans beyond the lockdown.
608,And then iirc every 7 foreign workers you need higher 1 local.
609,If we're talking about 'character and citizenship' education which has more to do with morals then that's conducted in all mother tongue languages but the syllabus is the same regardless of the medium of instruction.
610,1/ Here's my quick translation of today's @zaobaosg editorial on racism in \#Singapore.
611,"tl;dr It attributes racist incidents to \#Covid19 frustrations, social media, and Critical Race Theory, described as an imported idea encouraging racist hatred against white people."
612,"The deflection and excuses rampant in this thread show that the problem isn’t just the racist landlords, but the entire society that allows this to happen without even a blink of shame or recognition of its damage to the victims that must be constantly be told “they are not worthy” of even having an equal chance to live as others do."
613,"100% of expats I've talked to say that they're very thankful to be ""stuck"" in Singapore."
614,"It’s not just IT jobs, people blame CECA illogically for *any* job loss, financial hardship, or the fact that gig economy jobs exist."
615,There's no hiding that Chinese culture is extremely racist.
616,">Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt  Of all things, I think this is the biggest problem."
617,I've also come to realize that racists have co-opted concerns about CECA to massage their racism in economic messaging.
618,"Unfortunately, legit cases of maid abuse are still happening in Sg."
619,1000 per month buys you very good part-time maid service.
620,I find it strange and entitled that so many households insist on having live-in maid when this really only necessary for specific cases.
621,That’s more than what an average expat would need I imagine.
622,150K sing is a very decent wage in these times for a single expat.
623,"172 and 975 are always packed full of foreign workers, and we unfortunate NSFs have to share this same space with them."
624,18 year old assaulted maid because he could not turn on the air conditioner on his own.
625,He is the type who would require the maid to carry his field pack.
626,1:  The government is the one that created the framework that the vast majority of migrant workers would live in secluded dormitories that would be isolated from the community.
627,"But it’s a combination of the government (for the lack of regulation), the employers ( for putting pressure on dorm operators to drive down costs) and the singaporean public for their reluctance to integrate with migrant workers."
628,An expat would be in a better position to advise.

1240,"> But there are two groups who have been affected by border closures too: Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) who intend to work in Singapore but are unable to leave their source countries, and the families here who want to hire them."
1241,"> Advertisement  > Advertisement  > As a result of a slowdown in the number of incoming FDWs as travel restrictions kick in, the cost of recruiting new FDWs from source countries have also gone up."
1242,"> With a diminished number of FDWs entering Singapore since the start of the pandemic, households requiring support in caregiving or domestic work have to turn increasingly towards employing “transfer” FDWs already in Singapore."
1243,"> Advertisement  > Advertisement  > Before the pandemic, there were more transfer FDWs but these workers were viewed less favourably than new FDWs who had no experience working in Singapore."
1244,"Now, the number of transfer FDWs has changed – according to recent news reports, there are 20 potential employers for each available transfer FDW."
1245,"> Domestic workers in Singapore (File photo: TODAY)  > To meet this increased demand for transfer FDWs, the Manpower Ministry announced in May 2020 a series of amendments to the Employment Agency Licence Conditions (EALC) to better facilitate transfers of FDWs from existing employers to new employers with the help of EAs who will also bear the cost of housing the helper while the transfer is being sorted out."
1246,"Instead of allowing for a transfer, employers might choose to repatriate the FDWs when they no longer require their services."
1247,But there are ways to make it easier for employers and FDWs.
1248,> EXTEND THE TRANSFER PERIOD  > The search for a new employer is often beyond the control of FDWs and their agencies.
1249,"> Sometimes, the search may take longer than the currently stipulated 14-day transfer period and the FDWs may end up being repatriated despite efforts to match them to employers."
1250,A check on MOM’s website reveal that about 500 of such agencies in Singapore have listed their interest to facilitate the transfers of FDWs.
1251,> Foreign domestic workers having fun at CDE's International Migrants Day celebration.
1252,"(Photo: Centre for Domestic Employees)  > An employer may hand his/her FDW to an EA participating in the scheme, but this EA might not be the original EA who had placed the FDW out for employment."
1253,"The new EA may find it difficult to assess the FDW’s skills, competencies, job aptitude, and successfully place her out within 14 days."
1254,"> Where failure to place the FDW within 14 days will incur costs of her repatriation for the agency, many might be incentivised to place FDWs out expeditiously, resulting in possible poorer matches between FDWs and new employers and a greater risk of potential future conflict."
1255,"> MAKE TRANSFERS A COMPULSORY OPTION  > Right now, allowing the transfer of FDWs to a new employer is not always the first recourse for employers who no longer require their services."
1256,"> We have heard anecdotes of FDWs being repatriated by their employers, despite having expressed their wish to continue working in Singapore."
1257,> FDWs take on large sums of placement loans and have paid agency fees to work in Singapore.
1258,Unilateral repatriation and ignoring the aspirations of the FDWs to continue working in Singapore will make them even more vulnerable.
1259,> File photo of a foreign domestic worker.
1260,"(Photo: AFP)  > An ideal situation would be if FDWs are given a chance to continue working in Singapore, and both employers and EAs consider their wishes."
1261,"> To this end, the authorities should disallow unilateral repatriation of FDWs."
1262,"Transferring the FDW to a new employer should be the first course of action taken by employers, instead of repatriation."
1263,"> Mandating compulsory transfer will ensure that there will always be a ready pool of transfer FDWs to be hired.Over time, the industry may see employment agencies more motivated to bring in only qualified and suitable FDWs with better aptitude who can be successfully placed out or transferred to avoid the financial risks of unsuccessful placements."
1264,"> In a similar vein, we hope employers will inform their FDWs in advance if their contract will not be renewed."
1265,"> Due to the complexity of finding a new employer because different households have different needs, employers should give at least three months’ notice to their FDWs before their two-year contract is up, to provide FDWs ample time to seek out new employers."
1266,"> For employers who have to terminate the services of their FDWs if they can no longer afford them when they lose their jobs for instance, instead of simply cancelling their work permits, employers can transfer the FDW to the EA who can then place her in new employment."
1267,> A more effective long-term policy would be for the Change of Employer (COE) consent letter to be scrapped for FDWs who have completed their two-year contract with the same employer.
1268,> FDWs should be like any worker – free to explore employment opportunities that may come their way at the end of their contract period.
1269,> Employers who wish to retain the services of FDWs should inform them in writing.
1270,> Employers who wish to change FDWs can also make use of the three-month (or longer) notice period to source for and interview prospective candidates.
1271,"> For FDWs who are victims of abuse and unfair employment practices, they automatically should be allowed to seek for new employment without having the need to seek for consent from their current employers being investigated by the authorities."
1272,> This is to prevent these FDWs from being “punished twice” by the system when their employers forcefully repatriate them during investigations or when investigations have been initiated.
1273,"We can do our part to treat the most vulnerable stakeholder in this equation – the FDW – better, seeking ways to meet their needs as well as ours."

2965,> Are Singaporeans more racist than I am used to as a European?
2966,>SAP school kids are taught not to be racist in theory but lack practical experience because SAP schools exclude other races and kids don't experience what racism is like in reality.

3027,"The point is, if there is no mention made of race and no intention to insinuate that race is a factor, is it still racist just because of the stereotype that curry is an indian food?"

3051,"> Do you think that, outside of the CMIO, the government discriminates more    Dude, we actually have quotas for immigration based  on race."
3052,Most countries have a restrictive immigration policy.
3053,There's a very good reason why Singapore is popular with Indian immigrants: it is actually one of the few countries that allows immigration and the bar is set fairly low.
3054,"> Doesn't that mean: for Singaporeans, the cost of living in SG is at least 20 percent higher than that for expats?"
3055,"No, we get more subsidies than expats."
3056,But Malaysia is far worse when it comes to racism.
3057,"So by your logic, no Malaysian should ever be able to comment on racism related issues?"
3058,Only people from countries that are less racist than Singapore are allowed to speak on this topic?
3059,maybe you should analyse why you get so irritated or offended by discussion of racism.
3060,hey!..............theres a thread on racism you would enjoy! .
3061,that other also face racism.
3062,and maybe reading about it makes one aware of the issues and stop making racist remarks knowingly or unknowingly.
3063,if you think it fine to let others exp racism or silence minorities from speaking up cos it makes you or sg look bad.

3083,> FDWs have the option to quit and stop working whenever they want  Most of the time they do.

3131,"your initial comment was this:  ""European countries don't shut the door to avoid guilt - they don't believe having a maid is a necessity in the same way people here do."

3181,"The below means that those granted temporary visa through CECA are not eligible for citizenship, permanent residence nor the 95% of the India Indian employees here who are not on intra-company transfer."
3182,So CECA facilitates only temporary entry approval and still subject to MoM approval and it's not an unconditional transfer of manpower as you see between EU countries.
3183,"Second, CECA was signed in 2005."
3184,So has CECA 'dented' Singapore citizen unemployment as a whole?
3185,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/UnemploymentTimeSeries.aspx   Has CECA 'dented' overall local wage growth i.e.
3186,The only direct influence I can see is NEA cheap rent + low wage foreign workers.
3187,> I'm not trying to be racist here so stop being so sensitive.
3188,The racism is pretty bad against them.
3189,"> IMO, we have to be more accepting of new immigrants, which is a huge source of innovation and talent."
3190,Is that racist?
3191,"Yes, this is racist."
3192,"> If I say I'm Chinese and In my tinder profile I put I only date Chinese, no Indian and Malay, is that racist?"
3193,"> If a group of people are hurt or angry at ALL Chinese people due to experiencing racism from SOME Chinese people, they are equally guilty of being racist isn't it?"
3194,But this also assumes that the hurt and anger is due to specific major racist incidents or attacks.
3195,"> If both are equally qualified, why prioritise the local guy over the immigrant  Is this a serious question?"
3196,"> If citizens are already treated differently then the situation where expats also need to wait means expats aren't really being treated that differently, no?"
3197,Offer any expat who got kicked out the option to stay here for $300.
3198,"> If my maid try to borrow money from me and I say no, does it make me an indecent human being?"
3199,Your maid has never dared to ask to borrow money from you.
3200,I'd rather put that towards migrant workers funds and so on.
3201,He told me that 80% of the covers are Singaporeans but 80% of the takings came from foreign expats.
3202,That industry is already fucked but you’ll have a lot less restaurants and bars to choose from or work in if you tank the expat population.
3203,I think that the whole field of CRT is about as valid as scientific racism or phrenology.
3204,">systemic racism is largely due to the institutions and legislation is a fact  But you don't need to subscribe to CRT, or any sort of critical theory, to accept that premise."
3205,"People like Sangeetha Thanapal and Kirsten Han can't even comment on homegrown Asian-on-Asian racism in Singapore, without comparing it to white privilege/supremacy in America."
3206,"So why are violent, racist, white supremacist views allowed to flourish?"
3207,"> If you have a problem with domestic helpers accusing you of rape, don’t have sex with them."
3208,"> If you read the article, it was stopped because the maid confessed her accusation was fabricated after the police confronted her with evidence that she was in a relationship with the man, not before."
3209,"> If your very first response to this post is to try and gatekeep racism or explain away how very tired you are of people talking about this very issue, then perhaps you are the “white moderate” that MLK is talking about."
3210,"The ""white moderate"" would be someone who agrees that a racist act took place, but refuses to take action in favour of peace."
3211,"We should, I think, allow discourse on whether or not a materially racist act happened in the first place or not."
3212,"> In US foreign workers still pay for social securities and Medicare which they don’t benefit from  Depending on your state, immigration status is not a barrier to receiving most federal and state benefits."
3213,> Some 95 per cent of the building's residents are foreign workers and the conditions of the building have been reported to be extremely filthy.
3214,"> In addition, only the CECA and 2 other FTAs have the cause on freedom of movement of persons in 127 professions."
3215,"However, on our end border closures are simply not an option, so reopening is very much local restrictions as well as border restrictions, and even when there are no cases we cannot afford to lift all local restrictions - not surprising to see more in favour of reopening here then."
3216,It's just not something the government uses to classify people unlike CMIO.
3217,"> In general, racism around the world has morphed from the outright hostility and discrimination to a more subtle kind."
3218,"I'd say racism has decreased worldwide, but the ""social science"" sort whose academic careers depend on making frequent studies on racism (i.e."
3219,"SJWs) have been pushing the threshold for racism lower and lower, to the point where they claim that ""you can be racist by being colour-blind"" and ""microaggressions are more harmful than overt racism""."
3220,"> In order to make it work here you'd need to knock the kiasu attitudes on the head though - wholesale changes like better paternity/maternity leave, flexible working hours for parents, affordable childcare options etc - and there's no real demand to do that when someone can just hire a filipino maid so cheaply."
3221,There's no moral argument here (unless you find the practice of using 'maids' inherently objectionable).
3222,Most developed countries don’t have a ‘abuse migrant worker’ problem because they don’t rely on it.
3223,"So... the country isn't just exploiting migrant workers, it's essentially taking tax revenue from countries across the entire region by undercutting them."
3224,"> In the 240-page report, researchers noted that those who feel racism is an important problem tended to be below the age of 50 and had education beyond the secondary level."
3225,"It’s interesting that the younger ones who feel racism is an important problem seem also the ones, I feel, less likely to act out in a racist manner."
3226,"Because of ignorance, they cant even moderate themselves.  .  > While most respondents (88.8 per cent) said it is important for political leaders to talk openly about racism, more than half (58.6 per cent) also felt that such public discourse could cause unnecessary tension."
3227,>The statistics you cited has no direct correlation with CECA.
3228,"In fact, I would imagine the employment numbers to be possibly even more positive without CECA."
3229,"So despite CECA or other foreigner intake over the past 10 years, there's no net loss of employment for Singaporeans and infact a net increase in wages across all percentiles."
3230,Shes adapted to your way of living and does the household chores better than any other new maid you decide to get after sacking her.
3231,Ive experienced that during my younger years and its so much trouble to explain to the authorities and the maid agency.
3232,> Indian companies  Indian subsidiaries in Singapore don't even need to hire locals according to CECA provisions
3233,> Indian expats arrogant and snobs  Remember the caste system from secondary school history?
3234,Families have to fork out more for domestic workers.
3235,"As for domestic workers, they are not a necessity and people in the US/Europe do without them as they cost easily 4k a month."
3236,> Is prosecuting netizens for making racist remarks online going to make them not racist?
3237,Your suggestion of ignoring blatant racism is dangerous.

3239,"Worked at one as a student, but can't rmb the name   Live in maids are more easily available, but you might find it unethical    > How expensive is child care here?"
3240,"I know it usually costs 500-600 per month for locals, but i suspect expats might need to pay up to twice that."
3241,> Is that racism or classism?
3242,"Pls, these kind of QC issues has been going on for a now while but always get buried under the blanket of ""xenophobia"" - so let's not pretend all of our expats are carefully and artisanally curated to begin with."
3243,> Is there such a thing as Singapore-born and raised domestic helpers  Yes they're called grandmothers.
3244,Isn't it kind of racist to restrict to Nepalese?
3245,"Imagine not wanting racist actions to not be reported cos it creates more work   >You think parents will just accept disciplinary actions lying down, especially if it’s not conclusive?"
3246,Your society is truly fucked if parents would get angry for their kid being punished for being racist.
3247,Says a whole lot    >You think there won’t be backlash if there is a racist allegation and there is no action taken subsequently?
3248,> It horrifies me that such racists are just prevalent everywhere :(  It horrifies me that such accusations of racism are just prevalent everywhere.
3249,> It is also true that the average Singaporean is not as good as the average expat.
3250,The average expat is already someone who is educated/skilled enough to leave his own country and strike it out overseas.
3251,> It makes sense after awhile and I've begun to see even concerned expats at this point realise Singaporeans are on the losing end of alot of things.
3252,"Consider that despite ministers reluctant to call Singapore a country and pm Lee famous statement that it ""belongs to everyone"" males here still have to serve national service   Are you able to tell us what these expats' observations are?"
3253,Fewer expats will absolutely not lead to more local hiring after a point.
3254,We need foreign talent in HR ?
3255,I get if you need loads of foreign talents in new areas like crypto and AI.
3256,Current policy is just hoping Singaporeans magically learn skills by being in the same country as foreign talents.
3257,Practically no actual rules or policies for skills transfer from foreign talents... just depending on MNCs actually caring about developing local talent.
3258,He does say things with a racist undertone... that's why I say he gets the general sentiment but cannot be supported.
3259,He could have asked about foreign workforce instead of CECA.
3260,Just as now he could have asked for a cap on foreign workers instead of asking for nationality caps.
3261,"What those people did is a completely different phenomenon from fusion food, and where the entire concept of their restaurant and so on had racist undertones - like what u/AureBesh123 said."
3262,> It's pretty easy to fall into the trap of believing your countrymen aren't racists when you aren't a racial minority.
3263,"I fundamentally believe that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of a free country, but that is entirely irrelevant to how racist a society is."
3264,"And I definitely do think my fellow countrymen are racists, in some ways more racist than some of my peers here."
3265,"Outright hatred, when allowed to exist publicly without consequence, can increase racism."
3266,I don't think I'm ignorant of the reality of racism - maybe the post didn't delve into it much - but I prefer what I consider a sensible approach to provide consequence to free speech such that hatred doesn't get to seem acceptable.
3267,The unfortunate stereotype of many old people being racists still often rings true in both countries.
3268,> It's still racism in the end whether it's intentional or not  On that we agree.
3269,Affirmative gender for race is racism.
3270,> It's very difficult to move to Singapore as an expat - your employer needs to prove that your skillset is unique enough that a local hire can't do this job.
3271,">   > These latter companies might probably think that there is value in courting consumers who identify with being Islamophobic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, fatphobic, etc."
3272,"> It’s probably easier to deport foreign workers who tend to be working in low-income jobs and have no stakes in the country, compared to trying to do the same with richer expats who likely have property and may even have settled down in the country with Singaporean spouses."
3273,"If Singapore adopted a similar system, the obvious result would be less political voice from minorities, Chinese dominance of Parliament, and increased racism."
3274,"I'm also here on EP - would like to be an immigrant rather than a foreigner, but Singapore government doesn't want to give me a PR after almost 10 years here, despite the fact that my life, friends, relationships are all here and barely ever talk to anyone (except my parents) from my ""home country"" any more."
3275,"see my [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ntr14n/what_is_racism_in_singapore/h0vjv6r/)  then what if the landlord just declines the Indian's offer, without mention of his race, religion, nationality, culture etc."

3278,> Just because an action/comment is not overt or not imposed on others doesn’t mean it automatically downgrades from being racism to mere racial preferences.
3279,Most of the racist actions against minorities are indeed subtle.
3280,yes we should make it illegal to have racist thoughts.
3281,"Even after the tightening of foreign worker recruitment in recent years, Singapore is still a lot more permissive when it comes to hiring foreign workers than the US is."
3282,"> “Understanding the history is important, but we must refrain from talking about race and racism as if there is nothing else left to fix, as if done and dusted, as if racist ‘incidents’ that happen now are minor or less significant and something minorities can and should tolerate,” Mr Kishan stated."

3285,"We were just talking about this earlier today, lol...  *Soooo* looking forward to start swabbing S'poreans soon /s  So far, foreign workers > locals."
3286,you're just giving ammo to the racists if you do so.
3287,you think racist people can tell (or care for) the difference?
3288,"If I had said ""Kazozo so basically you are saying that it is okay to be racist so long as you are ignorant about it"", and then when you (very reasonably) ask me ""where have I said that"", and then I reply ""let's not play with semantics"", you would rightly be able to say that I am making unsupported accusations, and am simply putting words in your mouth and deliberately ignoring where you have expressly stated otherwise."

3290,"Furthermore, immigrants tend to assimilate better."

3386,"> Officials had earlier said they aimed to have 50 per cent of the population fully vaccinated by August and 75 per cent by October, though these targets depend on whether **supplies remain steady**  I urge all Western expats in Singapore to write to their representatives in their home country to STOP practicing VACCINE NATIONALISM on a GLOBAL scale by restricting export of vaccines before you complain about Singapore government practising vaccine  nationalism by vaccinating Singaporeans first."
3387,"I also agree with the OP that it's NOT xenophobic to ban people from Hubei or even whole of China (if it comes to that), if that is deemed as the right thing to do based on qualified, expert assessment i.e."
3388,Hit them in the wallet and the racism will disappear.
3389,I will happily report racists even if I have to look for other accommodation.
3390,The 'racist' landlord then sees that prospective tenant is someone of race he/she doesn't like.
3391,racism offence or not?
3392,racism offence or not?
3393,"90 Indians, 10 non-Indians, then lease granted to non-Indian, racism offence or not?"
3394,racism offence or not?
3395,Well according to the article the maid lied about rape because her request to return to Indonesia was denied.
3396,"They do check all documents anw again on arrival  Not entirely sure what the process is now with VTL flights, but they were basically shovelling everyone off my flight down a specific route to get through immigration, get your bags, get your PCR test and then get on the bus to the quarantine hotel."
3397,Worse still are the strawman arguments (xenophobia accusations on all CECA discussion) and lack of transparency.
3398,The main argument used to shut down any criticism about CECA is that there are no facts and figures which suggest FTs who benefited from CECA are over-represented in our workforce.
3399,"While I'm not denying that national favoritism exists, a lot of the ""Indians hiring people from their villages"" (hur hur socially acceptable casual racism -Indians must be from villages right) comes from us just having networks that we are SUPPOSED to tap into, it's literally part of our jobs (I get $4000 for a successful referral, give me one good reason why I shouldn't do it)"
3400,"Nothing bad, or racist about that."
3401,"If people keep crying ""racism"" at non-racist actions, soon enough society won't care when real racism does happen."
3402,"> Opposition to Immigration doesn't make you racist, but the arguments used often hold these racist overtones of protecting against the sub-human Indian masses."
3403,"People are just as happy to kick out immigrants from China, SEA or even the West."
3404,"This is the problem with seeing everything through the lens of identity politics, everything becomes ""racist""."
3405,> Or a racist bastard die die don't want to sell the last waffle in hope that a chinese customer would come and buy the last waffle?
3406,"IE, one set of rules for ""residents"", one for MW, and one for ""expats""."
3407,"Elites (walkabout MPs, etc) above expats."

3412,Students should not have to forgo the ability to learn about their own mother tongue in order to get into these schools.
3413,"> Plus there is no VTL economy option at all  That's normal for direct flight, it'll come back once there's a VTL with Japan for the usual Singapore - Tokyo - SF route."
3414,"> Predominantly the expats will integrate with the wealthier Singaporeans because they share the same housing, purchasing power and social circles."
3415,This has always been the case and will probably always be the case; the same expat wouldn't be socialising with someone in their home country of a massively different socioeconomic group and the wealthy Singaporean probably doesn't integrate much with other Singaporeans on lower salaries/in different socioeconomic groups.
3416,>It is an example of active racism and prejudice.
3417,"Yes, and that's the core argument - it is a privilege to not have to face such racism."
3418,"I never denied the existence of racist and hurtful comments, but simply that lumping everybody who want transparency in foreigner influx as ""far right nationalist"" is being frivolous and not understanding the root of the issue."
3419,that's racist.
3420,"Sadly, much of the anti-racism activism today are racist in nature too."
3421,"> Racist attacks similar to or worse than the ones we've seen this year could happen, targeting people of Muslim descent or Indonesians, with our government throwing the book at the people behind the racist attacks."
3422,> Ramesh by his accent is almost certainly not a CECA immigrant as he has obviously stayed here for decades.
3423,"Additionally, CECA immigration protocols only apply to intracompany transfers for HQ offices and I'm pretty sure only a few thousands reside here under the scheme."
3424,Opposing CECA isn't xenophobic but the only connection between the Ramesh Incident and CECA is Indians.
3425,If Ramesh isn't a CECA immigrant you're absolutely right about this whole thing being racist af.
3426,"aside from the CECA issue, assuming that's true, then what?"
3427,> SG is an egalitarian society and expat Indians bring their classism to SG.
3428,"> SINGAPORE: It was midnight on Tuesday (Apr 14) when a sense of dread filled **Sudesna Roy Chowdhury** as she absorbed the breaking news: A record number of new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, with the vast majority of linked cases coming from foreign worker dormitories."
3429,It was written by a western expat.
3430,"> She also faces 10 counts of offences under the Employment of Foreign  Manpower Act, including nine for failing to pay the domestic worker -  Sugiyem Samad Radimah - her salary for the period of January to  September last year."
3431,Does MOM exercise *any* oversight over salary payments for FDWs?
3432,"By 2nd month, should withdraw the FDW and let her find another employer or something."
3433,"> She also told the maid that if she ran away, she would call the police and “put her in jail for 20 years”."
3434,"Other options with similar rental price are : Lavender, Kallang, Boon Keng, Tiong Bahru ..   > I know the Little India riots are 2 years ago, but is that area still full of foreign workers at nights/weekends?"
3435,Most of the foreign workers are nicer than you may expect.
3436,"Weekdays are very quiet but in weekends, huge amount of foreign workers are there to do their things."
3437,> I also read on some expat board that the area has incessant noise from the temples.
3438,> Should **sexism** be treated the same way as racism.
3439,> Singapore  will allow some migrant workers – who have largely been confined to  dormitories – to visit recreation centres as the city state gradually  relaxes measures to stem the spread of the [coronavirus](https://www.scmp.com/coronavirus/asia) disease.

3442,"When it comes to CECA, there is a dire lack of numbers to support the benefits beyond GLCs."
3443,How has CECA affected a Singaporean citizen's life negatively when the unemployment rate has remained steady and wages across all percentiles gone up and beaten inflation for the past 10 years?
3444,"> Singapore further tightened its COVID-19 testing scheme with effect from Dec 7, with all travellers entering the country via the VTL required to undergo tests daily for seven days on arrival."
3445,> Singapore is in a very weird quandary;  As a foreigner and former expat in Singapore I have to say that I think you have described the situation extremely well.
3446,> Singaporean Chinese can be quite racist.
3447,But I'm not sure if this incident of yours counts as an actual instance of racism.
3448,">  >  >  > Perhaps this particular girl did indeed have racist intent when she shouted ""Apunehneh!"""
3449,It's racist as long as he finds it racist.
3450,> Singaporeans shouldn’t be entitled to things that immigrants aren’t  Such as voting?
3451,"Financial difficulties can be enough coercion to keep a maid “in check”, also keep in mind that many confiscate the maids passports."
3452,"In many cases maids that come over doesn’t have a choice, they have no education and no choices."
3453,"You seem to be under the impression that these maids have a lot of choices, they don’t."
3454,"> If everyone thought like you and refused to hire a maid, those who would suffer the most would be the same young women of the developing world who you are trying to protect."
3455,>Europe is also be a more racist place than Singapore.
3456,> So we just accept racism?
3457,Great POV there edge lord  depends on what you mean by racism.
3458,"if racism just means people differentiating according to race, then yes, i don't see why there's any issue with that."
3459,> So why the specific hate for CECA then?
3460,"That being said, it's not exclusive to CECA - I've observed the same occurrences from PRC and pinoys."
3461,"> Singapore's level of press freedom and treatment of low-wage migrant workers were ranked bottom of the list, with only about one-third of respondents saying they were proud or very proud of these."
3462,> Some maids **were** asked
3463,> Someone shouting out “there’s racism somewhere in this universe” isn’t going to do anything or help with anything.
3464,"IMO, How maids live, are FAR MORE LIVABLE than is ""livable""."
3465,I have heard of Single mothers who have it far worse that the average maid.
3466,> Speaking English -> Internalised racism -> Aspiring to be more western.
3467,"As before, you make the same mistake of assuming that internalized racism and economic advantage are mutually exclusive, to which I raise the same point several posts ago - why not both?"
3468,"And what if the average person in their constituency is a xenophobic, anti-LGBT, anti-science (as in, doesn’t believe in evolution and climate change), racist/sexist bigot?"
3469,"> Statistically it is unrealistic to expect the majority of the population here to be able to compete with the top percentile of the world who are coming here as expats  So why ""good riddance""?"
3470,"> Step 1: Accept that racism exists and that it is enabled by structural factors such as government policies, ideology, and social norms."
3471,Different people have a different views on whether each policy is racist.
3472,"Here you argue that EIP (Ethnic Integration Policy) and GRC systems are racist, but these are implemented by the government to counter the ""tribal instincts""."
3473,"> Step 1: Accept that racism exists and that it is enabled by structural factors such as government policies, ideology, and social norms."
3474,if we start examining whether racism played a part in their rise to the top.
3475,why reflect on our own racism when they can just laugh and mock malaysia or usa for racism.
3476,The long term effects of immigration often include [increased productivity and wages](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/42/pdfs/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers.pdf).
3477,"A lot of huge assumptions here btw, you're already assuming that all non-Indians are racist because they grow up seeing South Asians do menial work?"
3478,But the question is...  1) will an expat who just want to work in Asia for a few years willing to sacrifice his 2 years to serve in NS and burn his other time to do reservist for a country that he has no attachment to?
3479,2) will an expat bring his family to Singapore and sacrifice 2 years of his sons life to serve in NS?
3480,">  >  >  > With that said, I believe in improving the working conditions of foreign workers here."
3481,"Allowing a better livable space in dormitory, giving maids 24 hours off days is not a farfetch improvement, with proper planning and management."
3482,"It's one thing to say, yeah it be nice if the migrant workers had better living and working conditions; but it's a whole 'nother thing to say how we're going to do it (which includes how we're going to pay for it)."
3483,> This manifested into two parts: the migrant worker's issue  The migrant worker was an issue because it manifested in the fact that the author had to wear a mask.
3484,She framed the migrant worker issues in her selfish context on how it impacted *her*.
3485,> That guy is a racist and took down his videoes after online backlash - maybe don't use the actions of an isolated racist to criticise our society as a whole?
3486,These kind of interrogations against our foreign workers / minorities are pretty prevalent my dude.
3487,Expat packages have been dropping as some expats now see the opportunity to live overseas as a benefit in and of itself.
3488,"""We aren't totally racist, we're only partially racist""  > Someone can be privileged over another person in one area (like race) but that other person can be privileged over them in another area (like wealth)."
3489,But people make racist assumptions when wealth and status become correlated with race.
3490,Undo the assumptions by addressing wealth/status inequality and the racism automatically vanishes.
3491,Continue to practice institutional racism in the form of AA and the racism continues.
3492,or is that racist too?
3493,US also has around 10 million undocumented immigrants.
3494,> The biggest irony is that my mom is an immigrant  You seem to be suggesting that this makes her somehow inferior to non-immigrants?
3495,"> The biggest irony is that my mom is an immigrant and cheated her way when she was in school   then by her own logic, she is also a chao ah lian?"
3496,"> The comic literally tosses the terms ""white supremacy"" (not to be confused with Aryan supremacy) around which in the modern context, is a definition grounded on pseudoscientific arguments reeking of manufactured outrage and reverse racism (if you're white)."
3497,"> I guess it's always a ""racism"" issue when you disagree with Chinese nationals anywhere."
3498,"I really don't see any part of the comic that makes the argument that it is ""always"" racism when someone points out an issue with Chinese people."
3499,It suffices for the comic that racism/Whiteness (we are really conflating terms here) is one of the reasons people are reacting they way they are.
3500,"> The definition of racism is already based around the intention of the person acting, so how the recipient feels isn't part of the determining factor."
3501,And feeling like it was racism isn't in any way proof of racism.
3502,"If the prosecution had to prove that there was ""racist intent"" behind every racist act, very few people would get prosecuted succesfully."
3503,> The discussion kicked off with an attempt to define xenophobia.

3507,"the point is how to you make a comparison with two persons and then prove that selecting one of them over the other is racist, when there are so many other factors that could be at play, especially if the employer doesn't place much weight on standardised metrics like test scores?"
3508,">If it happens, they will be GLAD they didnt work under a racist boss, and if theyre that good they will be able to find another job elsewhere."
3509,"so many people are complaining about ""Chinese speaking required"" or allegedly racist hiring practices."
3510,"if what you say is accurate, then these people should be happy that these 'racist' employers flag themselves out so jobseekers save their time by having to avoid applying to them."

3515,> The maid was convicted of making a false accusation.
3516,"The police did not charge the man, because the maid admitted that she lied about the rape."
3517,It would not justify the maid's offence (or her conviction).
3518,"> The maid who was rolling in pain ended up getting checked at a Singapore hospital only after she called her neighbour’s helper, as her employer would only give her Panadol."
3519,——————  > Almost all the maids TODAY spoke to knew they would have to pay placement fees – or “maid loans” – of about six to nine months.
3520,"> The maid, who was on holiday in the Philippines at the time, was told by Theresa not to come home since there was no longer a need for her services, the court heard."
3521,Median household income in Singapore is high because it only includes the income of Singapore residents and excludes poorly paid foreign workers.
3522,"> The ministry said that upon investigation, the majority of cases were FDWs who had been deployed with their charges - either children or seniors - to the homes of close family members to provide care there."
3523,"> An expat that wants to work in this part of the world  Most expat jobs don't work like that: there are positions offered around the world, and they pick them based on attractiveness of it (which does include quality of life, the way you get treated by authorities, etc.)"
3524,Just because EDMW thinks “expat” when they see an Ang Mo and “immigrant” when they see brown skin doesn’t make it so.
3525,> The perception that racism is greater is because it's constantly discussed and there are strong laws surrounding protected classes  People there get killed (or physically assaulted) much more frequently as a result of racism though.
3526,> The problem isn't in having maids.
3527,The issue is how the employers treat maids.
3528,OP is saying practice of hiring maids is shocking.
3529,"now you re saying 'oh hiring maids is ok, just treat them well'."
3530,"> The question then - does criticising the Malays make LKY a racist, considering that it was a same criticism echoed by a leader of their own race?"
3531,"My view is that 4. is irrelevant to 3, so Yes it is still racist."
3532,None of this is employment per se nor should it interfer with his employment pass.
3533,> The term Sinkies is racist and derogatory.
3534,> The term ang mo is sometimes viewed as racist and derogatory by Caucasians  And what part of this do you not understand?
3535,"Funny, you know that argument applies the most to our foreign workers, right?"
3536,"Just fyi, my comment was about how we deny our foreign workers agency."
3537,Let's not pretend that isn't true - most maids will simply not get any agency in choosing when they're off day is.
3538,So distract with CECA.
3539,And from the OP:  > Singapore needs foreign workers to do all the jobs that most Singaporean don't want to do  In my opinion the relationship is backwards.
3540,will landlord be forced to hand keys over to someone who complains landlord is racist?
3541,will employer be forced to hire someone who complains that employer is racist?
3542,how to prove racism?
3543,"> There are other things in CECA, like perhaps Singaporeans can set up businesses in India easier  Not being racist (nor hostile to you) or anything, but have you handled India's Indians as part of a business?"
3544,> There was no evidence of remorse shown given that the two domestic workers were not spared the ordeal of testifying in a full trial.
3545,"> These people are sure quiet regarding how foreign workers,are treated here."
3546,"I volunteered with TWC2 (migrant worker charity) for years throughout sec school and JC, wayyy before it was trendy."
3547,"Today, everyone's all for migrant worker rights, but back then despite my lengthy explanations, everyone thought I was insane / a conspiracy theorist for even implying foreign workers were terribly treated (""they should be grateful they're in SG"")."
3548,"Again as someone who volunteered on the ground for migrant workers (and saw some horrible things), as long as this widespread knowledge legitimises race equality and allows Singaporeans to draw a parallel to migrant worker issues, I'm happy."
3549,"Indeed it seems more useful so far in getting people to say ""so why don't you care about the migrant workers??"""
3550,"> They added that they are proud of the housing system for migrant workers in Singapore, and that the housing and amenities provided are ""among the best""."
3551,"u can go read the horror stories on sites like toc and twc2   > said that the regulatory framework for migrant workers in areas like housing, employment privileges, workplace safety and health is robust and has progressively improved over the years."
3552,why then is covid cases amongst foreign workers so damn high compared to rest of population  trying to push the blame to govt for having weak framework?
3553,"> It questioned whether Singaporeans could bear ""higher costs and inconveniences"" if there were fewer migrant workers."
3554,ppl making racist remarks will just say and go about their lives.
3555,"And they even had the gall to blame us for the increased cases and tried to blame us for being ""xenophobic""."
3556,"Now it turns out the quarantine procedures are ""flexible"" and we can't restrict flights from nations where covid is rampant because that's ""racism""."
3557,"> This is Singapore, the politicians admit, where an inherently racist instrument used to administer education, housing, presidential candidature, helps us not be racist."
3558,"In his 40s, he's never experienced anything else; he was already at least a teenager by the time we could ""afford"" self-inflicted wounds like racism, self-segregation, and elitism."
3559,"> This is an issue of education, not lack of laws on how to treat a maid."
3560,"The maid is another human being, not a robot."
3561,"I am saying, that directly attributing recent cases of racism (such as that Chinese guy yelling at a Chindian couple) to British colonialism is beyond absurd."
3562,"CRT is racist and white supremacist because it places all the wrongs of the world, as well as the ability to fix them, on white people."
3563,"In doing so it puts disproportionate agency and power on white people, while dehumanising and stripping the agency of non-whites, who according to CRT can't even do something simple like *be racist* without white people influencing them."
3564,I'm saying that such behaviour is home-grown Chinese Singaporean racism.
3565,"You're claiming that no, it's actually because British people colonised Singapore over half a century ago and somehow got this Chinese guy to be... racist against a Chindian couple in a context with 0 white people?"
3566,"Is scientific racism true because ""academia is all about uncovering truths"" and there were once a significant number of academics who supported it?"
3567,> This is racist and is wrong.
3568,"But if we define racial preference to be racist, then now I will be obligated to at least interview or even hire the Chinese."
3569,Which would mean that I'm actually being racist again my own race.
3570,I'd dare bet my last dollar that > 50% of Singaporeans are closet racists.
3571,"> This seems to be implying the police has to prove a negative, that the man never raped the maid."
3572,"The point I am making here is in response to the earlier post that the maid had ""exonerating evidence""."
3573,"Re-read my comment ""If the maid truly was being prevented from going back to Indonesia and lied **because she felt like she had to in order to go home**, then this is clearly a relevant mitigating factor."""
3574,In the past they had to pay expat packages because otherwise not many Europeans or Americans would be willing to move halfway across the world to some obscure Asian country.
3575,They never had to pay expat packages to someone in India or China because you can find millions of people willing to move west at the drop of a hat.
3576,"Now, times are changing and Asia is the place to be, so expats don't need the same incentives to move here."
3577,"If you wanna move somewhere else, be ready and willing to pay for it all, like how immigrants from third world countries have always done."
3578,"Plenty of SGeans (and other non-Europeans) who move to Europe as expats, get expat packages too, though as the article states this is in decline."
3579,"Imo it'd be consistent to have a similar level of forced savings for maids, e.g."
3580,The Singaporeans that earn at this level are not going to be offered an expat package in another major industrialised country any time soon.
3581,"> To be fair, rather than being them into you or not, it's more about just how much they are institutionalized by the casual racism."
3582,"> To recognise the poverty and exploitation of migrant workers, not as a separate phenomenon, but as tied to other experiences of deprivation in Singapore, is a form of solidarity too."
3583,"It rejects the narrative that we can resolve poverty in Singapore by moving locals into higher income jobs, it insists that poverty will remain a concern for us until migrant workers’ poverty and exploitation is addressed too, alongside locals’."
3584,the same logic used to keep labour policies exploitative for foreign workers will be used on sinkies.
3585,"Wouldn't be racist any more, would it?"
3586,>but I don’t have the prior intuition that Chinese females are somehow less racist than males.

3589,> Two foreign worker dormitories that have seen a climb in new Covid-19 infections have been gazetted as isolation areas to prevent further spread of the disease.

3594,Sadly a little too late for Ms. Piang but I really hope that this initiative will drive down the rate of maid abuse.
3595,> Unless you are racist or sex predator what's the problem with the issues she raised ?
3596,"Yes, it is possible for a worker that stays in a dormitory to infect someone outside, who then goes on to spread it to others (which would be deemed as local case/non-dormitory)."
3597,"> We are okay with foreign workers coming in to do blue collared work, but not okay with them taking high paying jobs despite jobs literally being merit based."
3598,Singapore is no more racist than China or any other country in moderating its immigration policy.
3599,"The average citizen, hell even the legit immigrants who were here before the flood came in, lose out."
3600,"It is very, very easy to call someone out as a racist and ignore all the inconvenient facts that come with it."

3603,"far off topic, this is just a perceived self-righteous racist rant where you think everyone is just helpless npc and you are the solo hero in a game or something  grow up, man"
3604,Is that racist?
3605,"But you can't actually post job postings saying ""white expats only"""

3926,>An interesting addition to this would be the unspoken fact that immigrants to Singapore carry their racism with them as well.
3927,There could very well be countervailing forces pulling against racial harmony as we get more immigrants with their own cultural baggage in Singapore.

3937,"Not everything is offensive, I would struggle to find minorities or sociologist that broadly classify all Chinese as racist due to privilege."
3938,But our privilege do enable racism.
3939,The societal norms at the time were to be racist and there were actual laws enforcing it.
3940,And just because those chaps were students at RI doesn't mean they approved of the racism.

3958,">As an expat, that book has pride of place on my bookshelf (honestly, next to all the non-fiction books I've never read) - it's very difficult to see the value of it from within Singapore, but the moment you leave and you assimilate to a fully Westernized system instead of the half-British half-Chinese system and thinking (and technically, people) in Singapore, it becomes a true wonder."

3961,"At least before covid hit, then it was a cesspool of racism from a range of ""why doesn't admin quarantine all the asians"" to ""why can't those bat eating ch-nks eat normal food."""
3962,"All while having ""anti-racist"" in their Twitter profiles and when called out, deflecting to criticizing China or claiming that asians don't experience ""real"" racism (like their experience as a privileged white liberal gives them any authority on that)."
3963,You'd pretty much have to stick to exclusively the international asian population in campus or somehow not pick up on all the signs of racism to study abroad and think there's no racism problem in the West (which i suppose does happen for some international students).
3964,***All of them have declined to comment on their dormitory ventures and the impact of the pandemic.
3965,"You're really comparing that, to Singapore a country where the actual PLEDGE has a line that speaks against racism?"
3966,What about foreign workers from less developed countries?
3967,Generally speaking it's useless to comment on racism in Singapore like Shanmugam and how it's worrying or  why it happens when MOE supports a racial bias in their funding of SAP schools where students are mostly Chinese and grow up not interacting with non-Chinese as much.
3968,">To bandy the term racism around so callously without ascribing intention, but putting it as a result without agency of the actor, and to lump that in with racism directed with intention, is to entirely dilute the point of racism."
3969,">By your definition of the KKK being more racist than the ignorant, you’ve already ascribed the intentionality a significant factor in racism."
3970,Intentional racism is worse than unintentional racism.
3971,"This does not make ""intent"" a necessary component of racism."
3972,">Either we say that racism requires intention, or it doesn’t require intention in which case everyone is racist due to the complex networks of consequences that our modern lives involve."
3973,"Not more racist than the other, for intention no part plays."
3974,"If you have the ability to write this, I'm sure you understand that the English language is not so limited that we are locked into a situation of all ""racists"" are equally culpable."
3975,"If intent is necessary, then are all intentional racists in the same moral standing as the Nazis and KKK?"
3976,"Isn't this the same issue of ""*to lump \[all intentional racism in with the Nazis\], is to entirely dilute the point of racism*""?"
3977,"Clearly, you draw your own moral differences between the Holocaust and an intentional racist joke like ""you Indians are smelly""."
3978,"If you are able to do that, why does that ability to differentiate no longer function if we include unintentional racism?"
3979,"However, it has taken on a derogatory meaning due to its flippant usage in Singapore as a word associated with foreign workers, which is also a symptom of class divide."
3980,">Because Japanese xenophobia, although more subtle, is far worse and these people literally get funnelled into these lives outside the mainstream."
3981,"While I do think that popping the bubble would be the right thing to do, I don't mean pop the bubble by adjusting the S Pass and Work Pass salary thresholds to reduce the number of foreign workers in Singapore and thereby collapsing the rental market."
3982,"If there are no race, then there are no racism or racial discrimination so why are we even bothering to talk about any of these."
3983,"If the maid's relation with your boss is so bad that they can't even ask for a day off, then my guess is no matter how strongly the government encourages, nothing will happen."
3984,"And there's no way the government can force a weekday offday, because there are people who legitimately cannot afford to have their maid take off on weekday cause of children or whatever."
3985,>Most maids aren't allowed to out unless it's specifically their off day.
3986,"Most maids are doing >12 hour shifts as well, so it's literally not viable for them to go out during their work days."

3989,Imagine still thinking that any local employee is somehow disadvantaged compared to foreign workers.
3990,>But I disagree that not noticing/knowing that the traditional dress was wedding clothes = racist incident by its very nature.
3991,Because imo racism requires a level of malice or deliberate ignorance.
3992,"I do not quite agree (see below), but for current purposes let's go with this definition of racism needing malice or deliberate ignorance."
3993,A person can be innocently ignorance but still utter some completely racist things.
3994,They have been told (maybe from their parents) that Malays are \[insert racist comment here\].
3995,"And so when they meet a Malay for the first time, they just blurt out ""you are \[racist comment\]""."
3996,"That person might not know better, but that incident would clearly be racist."
3997,">I'm just sick of people wholesale going ""they actually argued with a minority who was saying something is racist?!"""

3999,">Seriously, I have strong feelings about racism."
4000,"Sure, we can have a discussion on whether the term ""racist"" has too broad a definition."
4001,"But racism and racial insensitivity (did you notice how PA used the term ""cultural insensitivity"" instead, just to avoid any mention of race?)"
4002,Addressing this root is more important than a semantic argument over the definition of racism.
4003,>But I strongly disagree with them having to accept the label of racist because of this mistake.
4004,Is the lady actually calling the PA racist though?
4005,"There's a difference between ""racist culture"", ""racist incident"" and ""PA is racist""."
4006,"Most immigrants are economic migrants, so they typically go from a poorer country towards a wealthier country."
4007,"There are a lot of immigrants in Japan from Brazil, China, Mongolia, Phillipines, Vietnam where the wages are significantly lower that have moved to Japan for job/economic opportunities."
4008,"My guess is if you zoom out, every country in the world is seeing a net decrease in expats because people want to be close to their family during the COVID period."
4009,"Foreign migrant workers routinely get exploited both on a major (ie coercion, illegal labour practices, threats of workpass cancellation if violations are reported) and minor (unpaid overtime, etc)."
4010,"In most cases, the migrant workers are reluctant to report their employers to MOM because they're worried about retribution, uninformed that whatever labour protections are available to them, or the opportunity costs of reporting an errant employer to MOM."
4011,"Regarding the last point, foreign workers are often terminated by the company, but are given special permission to stay in Singapore for the duration of the case/investigation against their employer during which they are not allowed to work, often stretching a year or two."
4012,"All of this leads to errant employers being able get away with exploiting foreign workers more easily, both on big and small issues."
4013,"Also, the most obvious answer is more stringent enforcement - more frequent, random checks on companies and their foreign workers would help with catching these abuses."

4021,"Lest you think i'm a ""bitter xenophobic Singaporean"", I hold a decent job earning above median wage in my age group."
4022,All those were simply more cost effective than having a live in maid.
4023,">But zooming out and looking at the bigger picture, I think racism is present in every country, and our government to be frank does it's best to even out these discriminations."
4024,"It's just that it's hard to wipe out entirely, especially the soft racism."
4025,"and I feel the only way forward is to encourage the government to perhaps hear what we think in a civil manner instead of constantly criticising the government (shit I sound so pro-pap), because at the end of the day, we're all really on the same side- fighting against racism."

4030,"EP holders from India (excluding the ICT above), are not a part of CECA."
4031,"For all the countries that many redditors have said to have less racism and xenophobia, would it still be the same if those said countries had the same level of foreign inflows that Singapore has?"
4032,"](http://twc2.org.sg/)  I spend a lot of my time with migrant workers in Singapore, as I am a native Bengali speaker, and I try to make sure to translate everything that they need to know about their legal rights and assist the organization with whatever translation they may need."
4033,>EP holders and FDWs etc are not considered residents.
4034,They just aren't allowed to do so while working as an FDW.
4035,"If not, FDW will be hired to work in the owner's hawker shop, then clean the house, then work after hours on night shift."
4036,"There are educated maids who have come back to work in singapore as maid agents, did you know that?"
4037,The exercise of FDW rights to leave any time they wish with no repurcussions is Also well documented.
4038,"The FDW holds the most power in the employment relationship, mind."
4039,Many maids do it jumping from employee to employer for a better salary or better working conditions.
4040,"Again, you are talking about something out of your depth, you've not hired nor managed an FDW."
4041,">Charge sheets showed Montefolka was allegedly hired as a maid by another employer, **Noraliza Kamardin, without a valid working pass, between August 2018 and April 2019**."
4042,"But from August 2018 to April 2019, the maid was working illegally for someone."
4043,It is not entirely clear what happened for the four months and how it came to pass that the maid was working illegally for another employer.
4044,Most apartments and villas also come with a maids room with AC so they are guaranteed privacy unlike the helpers living in HDB here staying in bomb shelters or in the service yard.
4045,So why act proud about how we are treating FDWs less shitty than what other countries are treating their FDWs?

4058,They can invest conservatively in western indexed funds and still get solid returns while the GLCs play dice on the back of CECA in India.
4059,"You will never hear this in the mainstream, but CECA was deal for SG companies to get access into India."
4060,So are the tenants racists too?
4061,"If it's because they have a demeaning or prejudiced stereotype on a certain race that makes that race inferior to theirs or others, then that's racist."

4067,Sometimes it's hard to say what is racism or what is someone just having a bad day/being an asshole for no racist reason but I'd say almost a daily basis.

4070,Ostracism isn't a crime.
4071,>Does it mean they would have no choice but to try to come back via non-VTL flight?!
4072,"EP's and tourists are treated the same, and can't return on a non-VTL flight."
4073,>Domestic worker abuse is rampant in Singapore even though employers found guilty of the offense face a jail sentence and ban from hiring future domestic workers.
4074,A 2017 study by Research Across Borders showed that six out of 10 foreign domestic workers in Singapore have been abused.

4078,"because racists never ever think that they're racists, otherwise they cannot sleep at night."
4079,They have all sorts of explanations and mental gymnastics in their head for why their subconscious bias are not racist but *rational.
4080,"* So they perpetuate this idea that only ""poor, uneducated people"" are racist."
4081,"Their racially discriminatory thoughts aren't racist, they are just SES discriminatory thoughts that *coincidentally happen* to align along race lines!"
4082,"^(or something)  Except this guy tho, he outright admitted he was racist."
4083,>>If you can relate then it is the same concept which for bias treatment it follow racist scenario as it is a bias treatment towards the races which also used to be ignored ay first until rioting happens so I don't think we need to wait for rioting to happen for this whether small or big group.
4084,Fuck you for trivializing racism.
4085,Didn't racist law start because the races cannot get along with each other that they resorted to violence which is when this rule become official?
4086,"So these FDWs a) cannot go out, b) have to work on their ""days off"", and c) are not paid for this work."
4087,">Each week, up to 500 vaccinated migrant workers from dormitories with good Safe Living Measures, no positive COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks, and high vaccination rates will be allowed to visit pre-identified locations for six hours  With 323,000 dorm residents that will only take 12 years for everyone to get a chance to enjoy 6 hours at pre-defined Little India locations."
4088,>Employer will benefit as the addition of a domestic helper would mean a reduction in costs in labour to act as stand-in for the maid during her time of quarantine.
4089,>Employers are bound by law to provide maids with a set number of **continuous** rest hours per day.
4090,"As per [MOM's FDW Employer's Guide](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/employers-guide/rest-days-and-well-being)  >To ensure that your foreign domestic worker gets enough mental and physical rest, you should allow her to have a regular rest day."
4091,>   >Your FDW is entitled to a weekly rest day if her Work Permit was issued or renewed after 1 January 2013.
4092,Literally nothing there says that a FDW is entitled to protected rest hours that have to be of a continuous stretch.
4093,"**  What is happening here is that a FDW who lives in, is fed by, paid by, has contact with the outside world limited by one person - their employer - is in a profoundly vulnerable state."
4094,Because the maid is the one working and you're equating the maid to you getting paid.

4098,>FDWs definitely should be treated better in Singapore  Well.
4099,in Singapore FW and FDWs are definitely treated better then locals.
4100,>FDWs do not hold the power in the relationship.
4101,FDWs hold the trump card.
4102,"FDWs (and other foreigners) either haven't been allowed to travel at all, or only with employer approval."

4104,">All government information regarding covid has referred to ""residents"" to mean PRs, and EP holders/FDWs have been ""foreigners""."
4105,FDWs have a work permit and are considered residents.
4106,This includes FDWs.
4107,Many developed countries have worse forms of exploitative labor than FDWs.
4108,">FYI, I just googled for a definition of racism: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particularly racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalised."
4109,"I'm sorry you can't be racist in the open anymore because of the ""fake woke crowd"" lmao."
4110,They come because Aingapore has low taxes and regulations and they allow companies to hire immigrants.
4111,"This family should be banned from hiring FDWs indefinitely, or make them install MOM-supervised cameras all around the home + pay a $5K-$8K monthly levy to cover the cost of monitoring their sorry asses."
4112,"As the offences were against a maid, the penalties could have gone up to one-and-a-half times the original amount  Nothing better to do."
4113,Not sure if that solution would be more or less racist.
4114,I totally agree that Singapore has an ass-backwards and absolutely opaque (and arguably racist) immigration policy with regards to pathways to citizenship and/or permanent residency.
4115,The point is that they will have to choose to hire locally or pay the premium to hire a foreign worker.
4116,"The push for immigration controls are mostly political rather than economic (though there are some economic arguments), and I don't see any similar political pressure against FDWs, so I don't think FDW visa auctions are a serious consideration."
4117,"I'm saying the PA should interpret this charitably and talk this out with her instead of issuing a public statement, given that:  - They were the initial wrongdoer - It's possible to interpret the reposted story as referring to ""ignorance"" generally, rather than this specific incident (although I understand why someone might disagree with this) - Her main Instagram posts contained no allegation of racism, and - She at no point directly stated that the incident was racist."

4120,Which is probably why he is pissed when you guys say the maids might get pregnant with some Bangladeshi construction worker.
4121,No wonder so defensive for the maids.
4122,Just because you happened to be born in sg doesn’t automatically mean you deserve more entitlements than the immigrant.
4123,"You are interpreting the meaning of quality and it is clear from the original quote >We are really substituting quality for relatively cheap foreign labour, and that is how our GDP (gross domestic product) has been pushed,” he said, pointing out that there were about 60,000 foreign workers in the 1960s but close to 1.5 million of them today."

4136,That is not how racism works.
4137,A minority race can be racist towards the majority.
4138,"> As a foreigner, is there a way to best integrate and not become an isolated western immigrant?"
4139,The requirements for working visas are quite strict and a hassle unless you come as an expat.
4140,>How does a FDW hold the trump card when her employer can terminate her on a whim and she instantly loses her right to be in the country (has to leave within two weeks)?
4141,You're absurd  An employer faces a significant sunk cost into an FDW plus a retraining cost to cancel an FDWs contract.
4142,"It is a cinch for an FDW to find a new employer, even within two weeks."
4143,"There are Facebook groups for FDWs to advertise, and they are not in want of employment."

4145,"I have brought figures and facts to show that reasonably, an FDW has similar earning power to a menial worker in singapore, as well as remit enough money to lift entire families out of poverty."
4146,"You have made several quite serious errors about your perceived rights of FDWs, nor have you addressed my point of why the wage may be unfair in your view."
4147,"If you want to claim it's exploitative, then you need to show that reasonably, the total compensation of most FDWs is far below what a local with a similar skillset and job scope, which you have not done."
4148,Most maids aren't allowed to out unless it's specifically their off day.

4160,"If you restrict immigrants, they pay more for low quality workers."
4161,The restaurant attracts foreign workers because the wages in the country is higher then other countries(why else would people travel to work there).
4162,">I always, just for fun, use the word ""expat"" exclusively to refer to Bangla workers/others who are in 'labour' jobs and use the word ""foreign worker"" to refer to whites, when I am around Singaporeans."
4163,"In fact, the whole reason you posted it was because you projected that she was racist and you wanted people to join your angry mob."
4164,How about you pay your maid $3k/mth?
4165,It's a separate scheme for employers who have problem paying for their domestic worker's medical expenses.
4166,It's still shocking (but perhaps not surprising) that there are people in this thread condoning this type of racist behaviour as some kind of sacrosanct privilege of owning property.

4175,Typical paggro Singaporean racism in action.
4176,"By doing this, it would have pointed straight back to the failures of PAP's immigration policy and their failure to improve the infrastructure to accommodate the massive influx of foreigners."

4181,"It's the tying of skin colour to traits like intelligence which clearly have no link that is problematic and gave rise to the racism we know today,  ""dark = ugly"" is absolutely nothing in comparison to that."
4182,>my question is why will top tier come to a place with so much xenophobia and where they are reduced to an identity?
4183,"The utility of having the MDW available...  Yea, i guess to me my biggest question is why were MDW (in particular domestic helpers) deemed to be a risk that G was willing to take."
4184,"But for domestic helpers, what kind of impact / additional utility would they have for singapore as a whole other than benefitting the direct employer?"
4185,">I feel like the whole idea of racism today has been blown too much toward disproportionately attributing it whenever the other person feels victimised by perceived discrimination in some way, even if NOT related to racism  Sorry, but who cares about what you feel?"
4186,Which is racism.

4195,racism offence or not?
4196,-LKY  our immigration policy is not only unsustainable but also economically irresponsible.
4197,we say that immigrants are here to support the ageing population.
4198,"putting aside the fact that many immigrants bring their aged parents over here which has the opposite effect, what happens when these immigrants grow old as well?"
4199,it is also economically irresponsible as the availability of lower cost foreign workers/talent removes any incentive for companies to increase productivity or automate.
4200,">I have noticed over the past few months (maybe even a year or more) that when random bag checks are carried out at MRTs, they tend to be for Indian / Bangladeshi migrant workers."
4201,"This is a multi racial country, mother tongue you do it at home but political debate on live tv must and always be english."

4203,The racist Chinese guy is not the exception.
4204,Seems like recently people will associate racism with every single fuck thing.
4205,In this case it's pretty obvious racism to me.

4219,"I'm just sad that scientists who dare venture and ask ""could there be more"" are immediately labelled racists."
4220,Is it just to fuel more racism etc?
4221,"To me this ""taboo"" is not helpful, and just keep racism in the closet and some times even fuel individuals to say ""hey this is prove of some big conspiracy"", or ""this pc culture is getting out of hand when see these people can't even acknowledge basic facts""."
4222,But honestly by having a taboo we're just having a word lost to racism.
4223,"However, I noticed that due to growth of internal tech scene in China (with pretty good pay, especially adjusted for CoL), the number of Chinese IT immigrants has been going down."
4224,>I think the horror stories give the vast majority of good maids a bad name.
4225,">I don't think that ""it can't be helped if the market values your labour at a below subsistence level"" is an adequate response to that either, because what is oestensibly the free market in singapore is constantly intervened with already (foreign worker policy, taxation/tax breaks in various industries, etc.)."
4226,i see foreign workers from another perspective: it's not intervention it's more like being more free market.
4227,"However, OP seems to want to drive this conversation in a certain way to highlight that SAP schools are a form of ""systemic racism"", has gone out of the way to negate some of the valid points that others have brought up about the creation of SAP schools."
4228,I am not saying everyone who attends a SAP school is racist.
4229,Just like that time a [French native failed Canadian Quebec French exam](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/immigrant-who-failed-french-test-is-french).
4230,I think that's pretty racist.
4231,"Probably if other people find out I'm racist they may not want to be my friend/do business with me (unless I'm rich/powerful/charismatic)   I'm not sure why you want a law to ""punish"" a non-issue."
4232,I am asking about this because I have no idea where to go for help on social related offences otherwise there are police for crime offences which racist just don't happen to be a crime at first but is now one.
4233,"If you want to equate your predicament of ""people not wanting to friend you"" to systemic racism you really have issues."
4234,"The first ever restriction on immigration in the US was the Chinese exclusion act, a blatantly racist policy targeted at the Chinese."
4235,"Let's suppose that the satisfaction you're talking about stems from racism, tribalism, and xenophobia."
4236,"See above  >neither could black people in the 1700s, or immigrants today."
4237,How does that compare to Black people or immigrants?
4238,Do you think immigrants and Black people are the equivalent of dogs?
4239,">I wasn't denying racism, the point you quoted was dealing specifically with the idea of inciting hostility   Yeah it definitely is hostile, you have to be absolutely blind to not see it."
4240,"This does not change the fact that its hostile racism, can we not slide into the dumb ""its only racist if a white guy says it"" mentality that occurs in the west?"
4241,"Even if someone makes a racist remark/stereotypes/mocks a majority, the effect is negligible in comparison to the effect on a minority."
4242,"We often default to the mindset that equates redistribution with sloth, while glossing over the __enormous challenge of making a living while being pinched from below by low-cost foreign workers, and outcompeted from above by high-skilled foreign talent."
4243,I honestly wish that they would restrict live in maids and only allowed it for the elderly and people living with a disability.
4244,His racist theory hold up like expired milk.
4245,>I would say that for a generation that has gone through worst hardships than these foreign workers.
4246,"Many FDWs day starts early, and they can save alot of time and money on transport."
4247,Why is it 'ok' for a white collar worker to be compared this way but not a blue collar one or an FDW?
4248,">If you calculate, let's say an FDW's active working hours are 10 hours per day, 1 month = 260 hours (excluded sundays), that amounts to only $3.80/hour!"
4249,"And these are considered the more expensive FDW, the average FDW earns way less."

4307,Many low-income families need FDW help because everyone has to work to make ends meet.
4308,"If exigencies crop up like having a parent diagnosed with dementia (pretty common nowadays), one person cannot simply arbitrarily stop working just to take care of a parent because there won't be enough income to go around, and hiring a FDW after government subsidy is always cheaper than the loss of one person's income."

4319,MP Sitoh was berating the foreign workers in the area.
4320,I worked with the foreign workers to improve the conditions but what bothered me was how the MP treated them.
4321,It is the democratic states that oppose things like the wall and also have things like sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants.

4346,"I'm sorry but that boat sailed a long time ago, people didn't start commenting about xenophobia in a vacuum but rather in response to the discourse on this issue."
4347,Your whole post is nothing more than strawmen as you list a bunch of things that aren't xenophobic and claiming that they are being called xenophobic in order to allow you to ignore all such accusations and the actual comments that are being called xenophobic.
4348,"Look at how common comments like ""Deport All PRC's Before it's too late"" is upvoted on this subreddit and tell me with a straight face that xenophobia isn't driving at least some of the hysteria regarding this current pandemic."

4382,">It's because we have no plan to let these people back into society  'As a precaution, all residents at the dormitory have been placed under a movement restriction order."
4383,This could mean that all your existing expats have to go home because their passes cannot be renewed.
4384,You can ask anyone currently dealing with helping out expats work here.
4385,what's very telling is almost every single instance of alleged 'racism' is of that from Chinese.
4386,"When non-Chinese are alleged to do racist acts, Chinese people seldom cry so much about it."

4390,"Many outright display their racism with comments like, ""The Indians stink our Condo"", ""How can we allow them to take over from ""us"""", ""We need to take back what is ours"""" or ""We must have EIP in Condo""."
4391,"They will justify their racism and stereotypes by saying, ""We need to give the right job to the right person to find success""."

4393,> >Similarly it's not illegal to give preferential treatment to those whom you like as long it's not related to racism and discrimination.
4394,Racist used to start out like this where I am Chinese and I don't like Malay so I exclude the Malay and lots of biased treatment and soon people wage wars hence racist got its name for that reason.
4395,A racist is a racist.
4396,"If not, Europe would have been populated by North African immigrants, USA from South Americans immigrants and etc etc."

4401,>It’s not racism  Actually all you’ve just described is pretty much the textbook definition of racism.
4402,"First off, the reason the maid’s passport is kept by the employer is such that they do not just leave whenever they want to."
4403,"However, would the government not labeling CMIO lead to a lowered societal focus on race, and therefore less racism?"

4419,"Already despite all the efforts of the government, Singaporeans seem to keep finding ways to make the lives of foreign workers misreable."
4420,However can the government reasonably bring a racism charge against a tourist who offered lunch to a Malay during Ramadan?
4421,"Among us beside the resident population, there are many like young children still learning their ways, tourists, new citizens, foreign workers etc who may not be fully informed of various cultural practices."
4422,A lot of racism ultimately stems from just that - insensitivity and ignorance.
4423,Liberal interpretation of racism is itself discriminatory and put the onus of knowing minorities' culture on the other party.
4424,"Do what you want as long as it's not blatantly racist like ""Malays are \[insert degrading noun\]""."
4425,This is not how racism works at all.
4426,I have a hard time believing these people won't abuse their maids if they were living in a quiet secluded city or big houses.
4427,"In fact it would be worse, they could openly abuse their maids since neighbours would not be able to hear them."
4428,Abused maids also would not be able to seek help from other maids nearby.
4429,My experiences of racism here are  quite different from some of those shown in that video.
4430,all this doesn't mean there's no racism here.
4431,">Local Indians are also often looked down by these immigrants who bring their caste system with them - that lady asked my mum what caste we were (my family is mostly Tamil, but several generations in Singapore has given us some mixed blood), and then gave a look of disgust when my mum said we don't observe castes here."
4432,This has happened numerous times with Indian expats.
4433,"Hell, I live in Canada now, and I've been asked by Indian immigrants what my caste is."
4434,>Without the taxes collected from foreign workers and without their contributions this wouldn’t be the place that it is.

4436,>Looks like Indian vs Indian so I guess it’s xenophobia and not racism.
4437,> >Not that it’s mutually exclusive but you harping on racism just make your argument weaker to actual racists.

4447,">Many millions of Europeans, Japanese, Americans would be estatic if they could have a live-in maid for say US$1,000 per month."
4448,"Especially the level of maid use here in Singapore - in the UK you might expect a well-to-do family to have an ""au pair"" but their working conditions would be vastly different to those that maids here have, and they're not something you'd see in every household."
4449,Here the use of maids is so commonplace it would include almost every social demographic - the equivalent of people in the UK living on dole handouts could afford a helper.
4450,"Most of these ""desired"" countries allow spouses of expats/immigrants to work without the ""work visa""."

4456,How has CECA affected a Singaporean citizen's life negatively when the unemployment rate has remained steady and wages across all percentiles gone up and beaten inflation for the past 10 years?
4457,The statistics you cited has no direct correlation with CECA.
4458,"In fact, I would imagine the employment numbers to be possibly even more positive without CECA."
4459,You spoke to a migrant worker about this?
4460,">More compared to what, it opens the door by allowing Indians in in the first place  Without CECA they would have been able to get EP anyway."
4461,CECA actively encourages migration by recognizing Indian educational accreditation for various professions  So are you saying we should not recognise any educational accreditation from India or any developing countries?
4462,">Most Singaporeans viewed globalisation and immigration positively, but about half felt “immigrants took jobs away""  Huh."

4465,"If I hear Malay teenagers talking bad about 'cina' or Indian old women being super aggressive and unreasonable (which has happened to me before), I don't see it as ""indians being racist""."
4466,">Most people are gonna say this is largely confined to the older generations, but IMO, the younger generations are as or even more xenophobic as they are the ones having to compete academically and in the workplace with foreigners."

4472,">Ms Tara also learnt from the Ministry of Manpower that the employer would have to bear the cost of a migrant worker's stint serving stay-home notice at a hotel and any treatment, should she be infected when she returned to Singapore."
4473,Wouldn't that make you racist?
4474,Today's society is more wiling to call out and video record racist behaviours.
4475,It's better for children to learn how to behave in front of other races before they develop a need to suppress their racism as grownups (I know a lot of closet racists who do this) or let it erupt and become infamous in SG.

4478,"The new VTLs are still a go, with the exception of the few countries mentioned couple of days ago(UAE,Saudi etc)."
4479,Having a maid is a very foreign and old-fashioned concept to us.
4480,"Finding out how many maids Singapore has was pretty shocking to me  Lol the fucking hypocrisy when so many Kiwi, Aussie and British families in Singapore hire maids."
4481,"Just go to orchard road, botanic gardens, or any condo with expat families."
4482,"However, it is possible for someone to have conflicting world views without realizing it, such as identifying as a liberal whilst still carrying xenophobic views."
4483,There's nothing inherently contradictory in being pro-LGBT and xenophobic.
4484,In America the conservatives are generally anti-LGBT and xenophobic.
4485,>Yep but race still plays a large role in politics because racism still exist in Singapore  Racism has always existed all over the world.
4486,>Not every maid dates a worker.
4487,"You, better don't lie and generalize that all maids do."
4488,"Gasp...""not every maid dates a worker""...yeahhh...and how dare they!"
4489,"No...maids also date expats, locals but those are the more 'elite' maids."
4490,They want maids to slog for them at all hours and not go anywhere on their off days...not to have relationships with the opposite sex....maids are not zoo animals.
4491,"Lol..This is just racism masquerading as culturism ...Indians are culturally inferior because of a,b.c traits."
4492,"To add to this, it is very difficult for foreigners' kids to get accepted to local schools (if you're on an employment pass)."
4493,Around the same what maids get here  Because maids don't come from Manila?
4494,"Much as I dislike the domestic help industry, my family ended up hiring my grandparent's maid after both of them passed away weeks apart."
4495,"Just as not all ang mohs are imperialist pigs here to colonise us, not all ethnic Chinese are untrustworthy or treat their maids like slaves."
4496,You can take your racist attitude and shove it up your butt.
4497,There's no protection for maids on what kind of standard of living they are guaranteed.
4498,Any maid can run away.
4499,"In fact, it's harder for a pregnant maid to be on the run."
4500,">Also note, if your maid is pregnant and doctor advice she cannot travel then as employer you have to bare her entire medical procedure cost (most likely insurance will not cover all medical procedure)."
4501,>Nothing racist or exclusionary about pointing out that the migrant workers situation is considered separate from the locals.
4502,"In one particular incident, I once imparted a good amount of my skills to another local guy, who then screwed me over and now basically only hangs out and rubs shoulders with expat bosses while complaining to me about his Singaporean team."
4503,"If you bitch about ""curry"" and ignore the smell of cooking almost any Asian cuisine that involves fish sauce, etc, you're just being racist."
4504,">OMG THIS i am reluctant to report on her behalf  Please do, get all these maid abuser cunts into the cell."
4505,">Obviously, you seem to think that ""expat"" implies ""white person"", and if we go with that questionable definition, then sure, white people probably do spend more than locals do on average."
4506,I was using the term expat in the same context as in the article.
4507,"Do you call the guys locked in dormitories ""expats""?"
4508,The only thing that has been said is that it's good for the country that expats spend.
4509,I can tell you right now that those expat packages are not cheap and most of those companies would hire similarly skilled locals if they could.
4510,"If Ho Ching shares a racist article, you're damn sure that she's responsible for what she's sharing."
4511,"Ho Ching would be responsible for **what she is sharing**, but that does not make her responsible for **writing a racist article**."
4512,"In our case, at worst we can say that Sarah shared a post accusing PA of racism."
4513,"That is different form ""*Sarah made an allegation of racism against the PA*""."
4514,"Of course, I don't even think the posts come anywhere near an allegation of racism."
4515,Instead it refers to *another* post which refers to the PA *but does not contain any accusation of racism*.
4516,The other mentions racism.
4517,"The latter is shared by Sarah, and somehow PA is asking us to lump all three posts together to form some kind of collective accusation of racism against the PA."
4518,">Oh, so Hitler was NOT racist?"
4519,In the preceding conversation you suggested that having a racist political party founder means all his party members and all his policies must necessarily be racist.
4520,"I can't stop you from asserting that LKY **himself** was racist, and you may have valid grounds to do so on account of this collection of quotes."
4521,But you can't make the logical leap to paint every policy decision he made or all PAP members as racist without backing up your claim with facts.
4522,"No wonder he doesn't get a good rap among expats in China, even those who have a negative view of thr country."
4523,So Ms Zhuo woke the maid up to wash the clothes.
4524,"IIRC, MOM guidelines state that maids need to have a certain number of hours of rest everyday, at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, usually from 10pm to 6am the next day."
4525,"I believe that waking the maid up at 10pm+ is a violation of those guidelines, and can be considered as abuse."
4526,>On a personal level he comes off as a cruel and mean spirited elitist and racist.
4527,">On the first day of their joint trial, the maid testified that she had to work from 4.30am to 11.30pm every day for the family who lived in a condominium unit in Jalan Mata Ayer near Sembawang Road."
4528,">On the other hand, the rally's use of themes like CECA and ██████ (which is Ramesh) tingles my minority senses, as it feels like dog-whistle racial politics  Well these usual dissidents have learnt that this strategy works, from Brexit to the US 2016 presidential elections."
4529,">On the other hand, the rally's use of themes like CECA and ██████ (which is Ramesh) tingles my minority senses, as it feels like dog-whistle racial politics."
4530,"It seems to be a jab towards ""darker skinned"" FTs, echoing kinda the racist undertones of this rally."
4531,""", why must specifically point to CECA/Ramesh, if the point is hatred towards classist/snobby FTs?"
4532,"Also, when the establishment is very ready to play the xenophobia card, one has to carefully word the ""no FT"" theme lest the ruling party brands them as anti-Singapore."
4533,Why target CECA?
4534,">On top of this, Mr Shanmugam said that certain parties - which he did not identify - had been “deliberately stoking the fears, encouraging racism and xenophobia, and dog whistling”, which is “dangerous for Singapore”."
4535,"> >Mr Shanmugam pointed to certain websites which were anti-Government - which he said was “perfectly okay” - but also deliberately fomented racism, with comments describing Indians as “cockroaches” and “rapists”."
4536,"> >“I hope responsible opposition parties will take a stand on this, notwithstanding that many of these sites that promote xenophobia support you.”  This is a textbook example of trying to score political points at the expense of addressing the real problem at hand."
4537,"I hate how PAP has used this incident to portray people of different political leanings as racist or xenophobic, because they have zero evidence to back up their claim, and have done nothing to ameliorate the insidious effects of racism creeping in society (cue selected presidency, race based national security policies, brownface saga, migrant worker class/race based segregation, etc.)."
4538,">One Hong Kong expat who did not want to be named said they would be HK$150,000 worse off when they relocated to Singapore as they did not give enough notice to reclaim their debenture for the rest of the school year."
4539,">One expat interviewed in the article gave an indication of expectations: He said a fair salary to **live comfortably** is S$7,000 a month."
4540,"Yuck  If she's so afraid of the FDW seducing her husband, maybe she should take a long look at herself in the mirror and critically evaluate her bedroom skills."
4541,">While I'm not advocating for it, I think the fact that domestic workers are paid to do their jobs is something everyone must remember."
4542,>Only if the cost you mentioned above is borne by the dormitory operators instead of the ordinary hardworking working singaporeans.
4543,">Only someone harbouring an ""us-vs-them"" mentality would frame condemnation of racism in terms of a zero-sum competition."
4544,Addressing racism is not a zero-sum game!
4545,"We should condemn all forms of racism, regardless of the alleged perpetrator‘s ethnicity."
4546,>Only the CECA has the clause on mutual recognition of standards in 4-5 major sectors of the economy to facilitate entry of Indian nationals in these sectors into S’pore.
4547,"Since you have a clear understanding , pls let us know as which field in EP/WP form will the candidate under CECA highlight that ""he is applying under CECA""?"
4548,It can be an major consideration for practical reasons but to make this a defining rule will draw mockery because we choose to ignore our own history as well as to choose a language that isn't even the official language or our own mother tongue.
4549,Should someone who speaks Malay as her/his mother tongue be denied because she/him is not good at English because we made this assumption that they can't integrate?
4550,>People  like to attribute racism to the older generation but but mind you  I'm a  Gen Z and these things happened like just a decade ago.
4551,"Gen Z coasts along thinking that  casual racist remarks are all just a bit of fun, nothing serious."
4552,poor gender relations lead to things like misogyny and misandry in the same way that poor race relations lead to racism.
4553,Singaporean jobs *are* directly supported by expat rentals.
4554,>Peranakan Chinese and Baba-Nyonya are terms used for the descendants of the 15th through 17th-century Chinese immigrants to the Malay archipelago and British Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore).
4555,">Pretty sure if Singaporeans working in a MNC have to relocate to another country as expats, their total package will also be jacked to proportionally."
4556,"Singapore has an extremely high cost of living, hence the jacking up of pay for expats coming into Singapore."
4557,"however, given the high cost of living in Singapore for an expat-like lifestyle, we are unlikely to get the same CoL bump that people from other countries."
4558,Excluded education because I expect the Singaporean expat heading overseas would also have their children educated at a private institution that would be similar in price to the international schools here.
4559,>Probably because more testing focused on dormitory and less on locals so not revealing the full situation.
4560,">Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the choice of countries for VTL entry is determined by **a combination of public health and economic considerations."
4561,">His rationale: ""Many of the countries in the VTL seem fairly random."
4562,Interesting pointon VTL's infection rate vs fully vaccinated traveller.
4563,"Till date, such sentiment still exist, but a lot of the xenophobic tension has shifted towards Indians cos of CECA."
4564,"And the Caucasians have always been at the forefront of the resentment towards foreign talent, when all the MNCs would bring their own people in management roles and such."
4565,>Racial ignorance is the same as racism.
4566,">We're a barely cohesive multicultural society because of such segregation and underlying tones of racism even within our government, and you're right that we have these policies to thank, because without them we might have actually thought of better ways to unify so that future Alsagofs wouldn't appear."
4567,"LKY does not need to be the equivalent of Chinese Hitler and wanting to make a Chinese Ethno-state in order to be ""racist."
4568,He can have racist views while still being PM of a multi-racial country.
4569,But his policies would reflect this if he was a true racist.
4570,"[https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/why-support-malays-must-stay](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/why-support-malays-must-stay)   This would support your second point, but I still do not think that classifying him as a racist would be fair, especially since it is so commonly used nowadays."
4571,"They both could still be racist, they just agree."
4572,Not denying that racism exist.
4573,"I don't know man, unless there is statistics that shows a particular race photo get misused more often, its a stretch to assume racist is involved."
4574,"I didn't claim that racism is the only factor, I'm saying that racism is a significant factor and we cannot pretend that a lot of Singaporeans don't take into account for racial backgrounds when deciding who should be Prime Minister."
4575,Even the most racist people will still have to vote for a minority candidate due to the GRC system
4576,"Most people are racist, one way or another, whether they mean to be anot."
4577,There is no clear line between outright racism and perfect non-racism.
4578,"The same joke may seem racist to 1 guy but perfectly fine to another, regardless of who they are."
4579,It might be true that Indians to do this on a statically higher than average basis but the rhetoric through which it's explained is what makes it racist.
4580,">Again this is reapted trend through [r/Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Singapore/) posts discussing Indians, racism and stereotyping as smelly casteist bigots without awareness of the Irony."
4581,">Opposition to Immigration doesn't make you racist, but the arguments used often hold these racist overtones of protecting against the sub-human Indian masses."
4582,Of course it isn't racist.
4583,Opposition to immigration alone may be seen as xenophobic which is actually a more related topic in this specific case.
4584,"There are racist overtones, but these are bound to appear within interactions between people of different cultures."
4585,"Put it this way, do you think ""just screaming racism and baying for blood of the offender"" will lead to a better society or a more polarised society."
4586,"What I said was:   &#x200B;  >all the Indian muslim food stalls that only hire Indians, and all the Chinese food stalls that only hire Chinese, are also racist  Which is obviously not what I think, but that would be the logical conclusion if we were to say that any racial preference in hiring is categorically racist."
4587,"There is a huge difference between      >I prefer to hire/rent to people of a certain race  and  >I don't want to hire/rent to people of a certain race  One is racist, one is not."
4588,">Recently, the maid place at my house was actually rejected/dismissed by her previous household due to the fact that she had borrowed money online or probably some illegal platforms."
4589,>Reserved presidency or other shit like that is completely irrelevant in a fair and balanced society  Would you say Singapore is a fair and balanced society with no racism at all?
4590,">because if there isn't any racism issues, there wouldn't be need for such crap  Kinda proving the point unless you are saying Singapore has no racism issues"
4591,>Rich expat has a great life in Singapore  What a groundbreaking revelation.
4592,">SG people are not racist towards the same people as Germans are  That could perhaps be true, partially due to the difference in demographics but in general religion is being left out of the equation here, which to me is refreshing to say the least."

4603,"To further explain my point, one does not need to totally forgo their own roots and mother tongue just to adapt to society, all im saying is that one should make an effort to at least know and understand BASIC english , hence i feel that at least there should be a basic english test carried out."
4604,"Just able to speak basic conversational english, eg, when buying items & speaking with someone of a different race , are you going to speak in your own mother tongue & assume that the sales clerk or so knows how to speak the same?"

4607,Thats the worst story you got about racism ?
4608,Its hard to feel sorry for your compared to a couple who were just minding their own business and got verbally harassed by some racist.
4609,Are we not on the approach that racism is racism even though it's ignorance.
4610,What's more this is racism done on purpose against another race.
4611,I get that we need to do more to support the minorities against racism.

4658,Nowhere did you state pre-independence/first generation/colonial immigrants.

4676,Would it surprise you that I find the whole situation reeking of racism too?
4677,The person who is crying racism here also happens to be a comedian who uses played up accents.
4678,"We have the PSP which nearly won parliamentary seats, and a big part of their voting appeal is this whole local versus expat issue."
4679,The popular pressure on this issue is so great that even the incumbent PAP Government has had to tighten various expat related thresholds.
4680,"Then based on the incidents that are happening, can people be allowed to generalize that Chinese Singaporeans are racists since ""we make decisions based on generalizations to some degree""?"
4681,>That is why I believe we must not let too many caucasian foreign talents into our country because it may serve as a catalyst to destabilize the nation that my generation fought so hard to preserve  What talking you?
4682,Extremely racist

4684,Those are literally the reasons my expat colleague told me when I asked why she chose to move to SG.
4685,"And as far as I can tell, the agent and landlord did not use any racist discriminatory reason for the refusal to rent."
4686,"The point is, imo no one will bat an eyelid in Singapore if a local Malay or local Indian puts up a rental ad and choose to refuse ethnic Chinese or Singaporeans, as long as there are no stupid or racist reasons given."

4689,We know from the dormitory outbreaks last year that these foreign workers contribute almost nothing to hospitalization - a simple import-and-vaccinate rule would minimize death while severely relieving the construction industry of its woes.
4690,">The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has asked employers of foreign domestic workers to remind them not to engage in terrorism-related activities following ""the developments in Afghanistan""."

4702,">The fact is, everyone is racist and tribalist at a subconscious level."
4703,Lots of benefits to being a PR/citizen vs EP:  - can get CPF  - can buy property for less (after 5 years)  - medisave etc  - can put your kids in local schools (much cheaper than international schools)  - maid fee is less  - misc things like library fees are less  - you don't get kicked out of the country after 30 days if you lose your job
4704,during jan when the cases are spiking we had cases in the job sites + the same company works in a few of the same sites + they were living in the same dormitory.

4709,"Even in Singapore, where racial issues are inherently policed, we still see racism - we did after all just have a teenager wanting to attack a mosque."
4710,"What do we mean by ""actively promote"" because anti racism efforts can just as well be actively promoted in the form of education and/or cross cultural dialogue, as it can be done via law enforcement."
4711,">But say you offer to share your food with your Malay classmates during his/her fasting period during Ramadan without knowing about Ramadan, this is just insensitive and ignorant, not racism."
4712,A lot of racism ultimately stems from just that - insensitivity and ignorance.

4714,Court didn't believe your accusations on the maid and your married son's kink got reveal on MSM too.

4717,"There's another link to letters where people complain about the one day they're forced to ""give"" their maid."
4718,">However those maids ought to still be treated with dignity and respect (like any other employee) and their rights as humans are no less important than your or my rights as a human  define 'treated with dignity and respect', and justify your definition."
4719,> then I would only hire a maid if I could provide them with a reasonable working environment.
4720,>The latest VTLs are only for for entry into Singapore.
4721,It's just what it is - you can't just expect hundreds (if not thousands) of years of certain aspects of **Chinese culture (including what you perceive to be racism) to be erased just because Singapore has been independent since 1965.
4722,"Also what OP outlined is racism, it's not about perception."

4729,"Oh ok we are in agreement then  >As I mention to another poster, we can adopt affirmative actions for entirely racist reasons as well."
4730,"I think it is an indication of moral absolutism when one pulls historical quotes, ignores its original context; intent and outcomes, just to make the point - in a stigmatizing and unflattering way - that LKY was the ""Master racist""."
4731,"I believe this is a view commonly cited in moral psychology, so I believe my fear is not unwarranted     The inability and/or unwillingness of many to go beyond ""look at how racist this historical figure's views are"" is not reassuring"
4732,They should be thankful they are working in a country which at least cares enough to manage covid among expats unlike the states and the U.K. where they simply deport the infected or ignore they exist if they were not citizens.
4733,Thats why they are expats.
4734,>The point is that they will have to choose to hire locally or pay the premium to hire a foreign worker.
4735,>The post noted that a foreign worker was trapped in the passenger seat.
4736,So is LKY trying to be racist?
4737,Is Mahathir trying to be racist?
4738,If the view is racist then both of them are racist.
4739,"And yes, just as you can have Chinese people who think white people are better than Chinese people and look down on Chinese people, you can also have Malay people who have racist views about other Malays."
4740,"Mahathir being Malay, a PM of Malaysia, does not make him immune for being racist towards Malays."
4741,"So maybe, like I said, they are both racist?"
4742,Or that the era they were in held plenty of views which we now regard as racist?
4743,">The responses were as expected mostly a circlejerk regarding how the real truth is being suppressed and falsely called racists  That is how most of the ""majority"" group of Singaporeans are."
4744,The saddest part is getting accused of being a racist when you call out this sort of discrimination culture.
4745,"Your construction workers, nurses, waiters, etc are mostly foreign workers."
4746,Like you can't harbour illegal immigrants or terrorists or some shit because that's illegal.

4748,"There's no reason to assume that migrant workers would be the main drivers of infection, especially when we allow the unvaccinated to still interact with the greater community."
4749,Obviously minorities can be racist as well.
4750,The entire construction / renovation industry almost collapsed because all migrant workers were quarantined.
4751,You see this in Western expats who are used to paying 1/3 of their salary on rent.
4752,"If this happens, the maid gets nothing"
4753,>The witness ran forward to help the migrant worker who had been run over by the lorry.
4754,"Because FDW are under their domain, and now they're literally the only group gathering outside, most likely on fields and such?"
4755,"You are aware that many FDWs don't speak very good English, right?"
4756,They rely on their network of fellow FDWs and official workers to receive information.
4757,"To me, it just sounds pretty implausible that the staff would purposely put up a ""waffles sold out"" sign because 1) they predicted their next customer would be a Malay and 2) they wanted to reject her on purpose because they were racists working at a Halal bakery (which would also have many other Malay customers)."
4758,Not surprising if you compare % of GDP spent on healthcare between us and our VTL destinations.
4759,"I agree, and any racist barriers which people face should be dismantled."
4760,They could in theory keep everything low theres alot of foreign workers willing to work for low pay.

4763,">There is absolutely no correlation of any sort between 'CECA' in any interpretation and hiring, I never even knew such a thing existed."
4764,"So it's no coincidence that with the '18 [CECA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India–Singapore_Comprehensive_Economic_Cooperation_Agreement) review, locals are witnessing a surge in Indian nationals in jobs across given sectors."
4765,">There is evidence of the ""widespread use of racist, aggressive and militarised rhetoric"" against foreigners on social networks  You don't say..."
4766,>There is no racism between Singaporeans in Singapore  Lol just because you turn a blind eye to it doesn't mean it's non-existent.
4767,>There is no reason to be racist.
4768,"A lot of people are racist, classist or whatever-ist, mostly because they haven't really achieved much in their lives so they need to use their race, class, religion or something to feel better about thselves when they convince themselves that they are superior because of whatever thing they belong in."
4769,What she did to the domestic helper's eyes causing permanent eye damage is unforgivable
4770,They want the immigrant dollars.
4771,"However, I would be less certain about the sociopolitical ideologies grounding PAP's immigration policy."
4772,"Even though PAP might be the most pro-immigrant party in Singapore, there is nothing liberal about its views of immigrants."
4773,"Our labour laws specifically categorise immigrants based on their economic value, with MWs living a very different reality from high income immigrants."
4774,"This intersects with nationality and race, with many immigrants from South Asia and the region predominantly living in segregated dorm housing, with limited immigration and civil rights."
4775,So to argue that PAP is pro-immigrant hence the party and its supporters are inherently liberal in their sociopolitical views of immigrants is quite a leap.
4776,"In fact, as we would definitely agree that the opposition camp comprises of right-wing and left-wing elements (I would even argue that some supporters of the opposition have and continue to advocate for greater protection of marginalised immigrant groups), so does the pro-PAP camp."
4777,There are people within the establishment who hold conservative views of immigrants.
4778,">The latest IPS surveys tell us that new citizens tend to be more pro government than other citizens  Secondly, immigration is a complex issue in the minds of voters (especially first generation immigrants), and we often make the mistake of assuming that all immigrants are pro-immigration."
4779,"If you look at other countries where immigration is also a hot topic, you will realise that even though it may be an important issue to first generation immigrants, it may not be the top issue on their mind."
4780,"In addition to my previous point that immigration policies might not be top most on their mind when voting, these values actually stem from more than their immigrant identity."
4781,There is a substantial group of immigrants who are conservative in their views.
4782,"If you look at the US for example, a lot of Cuban Americans view their path to immigration very differently from other Central American immigrants fleeing to the US now."
4783,"Some immigrants do believe that they had worked hard to naturalise the right way, and there are some immigrants that shouldn't be naturalised."
4784,Some believe that some immigrants from elsewhere bring in values from other places and can't integrate well.
4785,"Essentially, how first generation immigrants view immigration policy might not be so different from how born & bred citizens rationalise them."
4786,> There's a very strict race hierarchy here and a lot of the racism and negativity flows on from that.
4787,And some people (migrant workers) have been in lockdown for 18 months so you can have  your WFH enjoyment.
4788,Many expats haven't been able to see family in 2 years.
4789,&#x200B;  >Same thing with the migrant workers.
4790,I believe Singaporeans are not that heartless and it is in the interest of Singaporeans to take into consideration the well being of the migrant workers as we hugely dependent on them for our economy.
4791,Really hope the government can work something out for the migrant workers cause I don't think it is healthy for someone to be coop up for months and months on end.
4792,FDW are allowed to travel for overseas leave if they so desire.
4793,Do FDWs come of their own free will?
4794,Construction workers and FDWs are entirely different categories.
4795,">They’ll just be replaced by locals at the junior level, and the junior level locals will gain enough experience to be promoted, thus reducing reliance on foreign workers at all levels."
4796,which part of immigration policy concerns justice and negative liberties?
4797,>However can the government reasonably bring a racism charge against a tourist who offered lunch to a Malay during Ramadan?
4798,"Among us beside the resident population, there are many like young children still learning their ways, tourists, new citizens, foreign workers etc who may not be fully informed of various cultural practices."
4799,>Liberal interpretation of racism is itself discriminatory and put the onus of knowing minorities' culture on the other party.
4800,All acts of racism are racially insensitive.
4801,"Sure some insensitive acts might truly arise from excusable ignorance, and are not racist."
4802,But this does not take away from the fact that racism and racial insensitivity are linked.
4803,">Some of the vocal anti-mmtf accounts here seems to be owned by expats who can't vote, people planning to leave Singapore or people who already left Singapore but just like to come here to complain  Are you implying all these 3 groups have no right to complain?"

4808,>This question was asked during class and some of the foreign students think that Singapore is overreacting and bordering on racism.
4809,Also what's stopping a future racist govt 30 years later from targeting majority minority neighborhoods like what is happening in the USA.
4810,"In the news article linked, ""The researchers also found that Chinese respondents (4.8 per cent) reported the lowest frequency of racism, while Indians (13.8 per cent) reported the highest."""
4811,">This would support your second point, but I still do not think that classifying him as a racist would be fair, especially since it is so commonly used nowadays."
4812,"If Heng Sweet Keat were to say what LKY said in the above quotes, we would have little problems saying that Heng is being racist."
4813,"As I mention else where, it is fine to acknowledge that LKY is a product of his time, so long as we can be intellectually honest and also note that by today's standards much of what LKY is saying is racist."
4814,"It is ironically the Singapore Chinese who have switched over to English as the de facto mother tongue (main language spoke at home), to the extent they no longer even remember once ferociously demanding Chinese medium education."
4815,Nevermind the giant middle finger shown to the expats living in SG since they have to apply to the right to re-enter once they leave (with no guarantee) but PRs and citizens don't need to apply.
4816,"They will be used for tours organised for as many as 30,000 migrant workers, 200 at-risk youth and 100 seniors  So fishy… Thought MOM is only approving a small handful of vaccinated migrant workers out into community each week?"
4817,">Treating migrant workers like shit, paying your new grads weak salaries and then giving ""expats"" a home and a maid is idiotic."
4818,"My point with that entire paragraph was the surge in Indians is not due to CECA, its due to globalisation."
4819,I just point that out it's entirely possible have racist views about your own race.
4820,">I don't know, the idea that Mahathir is racist against Malays is completely incredulous to me."
4821,Okay but this is not an argument why he is not racist.

4823,""", would you have problems calling that racist?"
4824,"And ""intent"" is the basis to differentiate between ""racism"" and ""racial/cultural insensitivity""."
4825,"Well, you can support your assertion by showing me any context where a law can charge a person with racism when he/she is proven to be ""ignorant that his/her action is offensive or insensitive""."
4826,"Which means everyone learned English, and you don't hear accusations about racism or Islamophobia or whatever."
4827,">Using your ""brownface"" as an example, if in a concert play, a few kids is supposed to put up a show on racial harmony and because they do not have malay or indian etc classmates in their cohort, having some children put on some makeup that ""darken their faces"", are we going to claim this is simply racism because of ""brownface""."

4834,"Edit2: The following -  My point being, I don't think anybody subscribes to your alleged group-think that ""white folk"" or expatriates of any sort are some miraculous corporate fix-it, divine or otherwise."
4835,The reason why there continues to be a market for expatriates/foreign workers is based on cost-benefit.
4836,"I thought my message was really simple - if your argument fails at the first cry of ""racist"", then you don't really have an argument at all, or are terrible at making argument."
4837,"My second comment in response to your first, highlighted a common defense erected by self-perceived victims in the face of perfectly sound critiques - that of decrying ""racism""."
4838,"So I ask unto you again: Should not the burden of a logical rebuttal now lie with the victim to make a case (furnishing statistics and evidence) for him/herself instead of shutting down an otherwise healthy discourse with claims of ""racism""?"
4839,Earlier I suggested that the premise of my argument can be logically computed independent of meta analyses within a given dialogue (is it truly racist of foreign Chinese diaspora to criticize Mainlanders for eating bats).
4840,The fourth panel works in both ways as it appeals to emotions (social behaviour) and logic (reports of racism based on supporting evidence).

4849,Those who are xenophobic will want more than just Indians to go back.

4860,Singaporeans are experts on subtle racism.

4862,"They let the Bangladeshi women and family go first after like 30 minutes, but since I obviously was a young single male Bangla Muslim dude, or whatever I was a threat or an illegal foreign worker."
4863,>Whats bothering me is that your relative who runs a maid agency did not even know that MOM had actually banned her from working in Singapore.
4864,"Indeed, but to think of that household that did not allow the maid to return home and probably not offering to help her and tide over the renovation at home for $150."
4865,"Advice the PA could adopt  >Will you lose a pound of flesh if you ""graciously inform the person that what he/she did is insensitive and may be offensive to you"" before you start screaming the person is a racist."
4866,No one (not even the original complainant) is calling the PA racist.
4867,Even the PA does not say it was called racist.
4868,"Without intent, there is no racism, PERIOD."
4869,One way to reduce the excess is to see what jobs locals can replace foreign talent and migrant workers with.

4882,>While I know lower-wage workers do not get EPs and nor are their occupations relevant to CECA I just want to highlight this observation.
4883,This is partly the reason why I think there is a racial element to the whole CECA issue.
4884,"Again, I mentioned that CECA did not apply to migrant workers so I was not saying that there are construction jobs open that locals can take."
4885,">While it does use the word racism, I think that what the comic is getting at is more the concept of Whiteness, rather than ""let us be racist to people who are not white""  The comic literally tosses the terms ""white supremacy"" (not to be confused with Aryan supremacy) around which in the modern context, is a definition grounded on pseudoscientific arguments reeking of manufactured outrage and reverse racism (if you're white)."
4886,"Should any criticism be leveled to said Chinese (""barbaric""), the comic jumps in defense and cries ""racism""."
4887,"Mainlander tourists were caught misbehaving in Japan (or everywhere in general) and when the locals attempted to call out on their behaviour, they were outraged in similar fashion yelling ""racists""."
4888,"I guess it's always a ""racism"" issue when you disagree with Chinese nationals anywhere."
4889,And this would've been a great subject to tackle **if** she didn't cherry-pick the circumstances to highlight racism issues.
4890,I have this conversation with very conservative colleagues all the time and it blows my mind how stupid it is to hear an American foreign worker (I refuse to use the term expatriate) advocating against globalization when he owes his job to it.

4892,>Do you really naively think the foreign guys who fxxx the maids will be responsible for the kid and pay for pregnancy fees?
4893,"You can advise, but ultimately, it's up to the maid how she wants to live her life."
4894,(something about child labour or the holocaust increasing socio-economic well being despite being immoral iirc) just because racism is immoral does not mean it does not increase socio-economic well being.
4895,How is that racist when placed in context?
4896,>Why does he want to come here despite all the xenophobia?
4897,"Speaking from my perspective as a white person I have (extremely rarely) in life been met with racism, but mostly I've found that what others might refer to as ""xenophobia"" etc, as it might apply to me, is actually a well deserved caution against the negative impact (mostly) white men have had in the region."

4917,"I find that timing matters, of when you're at the receiving end of racist comments."
4918,It's a different thing when such racism and messaging that you are lesser because of you skin color has been drilled into you since young.

4924,"&#x200B;  >The police did not charge the man, because the maid admitted that she lied about the rape."
4925,The man did not rape the woman because she admitted to lying about that allegation - if he did rape her then the maid's allegations are not a lie.
4926,">I don't quite see this as true, since as I have mentioned we can be motivated in more than one way (racist or valid) for any set of actions."
4927,">If you don't really have a response to the simple decry of ""racist"", then perhaps your rational position is not quite rational?"

4929,">   >...   >   >If we can agree that some people behave as they do either because they are racist towards PRCs, or due to the more passive effect of Whiteness, then in my view that validates the point that the comic is getting at."
4930,"Yet she is quick to declare racism as an issue of ""white supremacy""/""whiteness"" (not to be conflated but she did use these two terms) which suggests that ALL white people are responsible for said behaviour."
4931,"Just to clarify, you're saying because everyone needs to declare their race and therefore there's no racism over here?"
4932,>You are wrong if you think expats all make 300K/year or 25K/month... WRONG  I would call them foreign workers not expats

4934,But it does not change the fact that Singapore still has the full control over limiting visa numbers through CECA as needed and it's not a free movement of people as it is often made out to be.
4935,"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/naftas-impact-u-s-economy-facts/   Regardless, if you compare the US unemployment rate since the signing of the NAFTA or China's WTO acceptance to  that of Singapore citizen's unemployment rate post CECA, the latter numbers are a lot more stable and in fact lower in absolute and percentage terms pre-COVID vs when CECA was actually signed."
4936,So is it possible that CECA has resulted in internal displacement of Singaporean jobs?
4937,I'm not saying no action should be taken against discriminatory practices (by locals or foreigners) but blaming this on CECA or foreigner influx for that matter is not macro-data supported.
4938,I keep quoting this example in some of previous comments and still don't get a satisfactory answer:   Is the following an example of CECA discrimination or still a net benefit to Singapore / Singaporeans?
4939,They hire / transfer through CECA 20 Indians and employ 2 Singaporeans.
4940,>You know FDWs aren't teenage children right?

4943,Leftist westerners are usually racist and blame western countries for everything.
4944,"I didn't claim that racism is the only factor, I'm saying that racism is a significant factor and we cannot pretend that a lot of Singaporeans don't take into account for racial backgrounds when deciding who should be Prime Minister."
4945,Even the most racist people will still have to vote for a minority candidate due to the GRC system  The same argument was used to introduce the GRC system despite the fact that minority candidates have won against majority candidates.
4946,"Its the exact same argument being repeated again, that singaporeans are racist and wont vote for minorities."
4947,">You suggested that if the gov fix the housing problem, then there'll be no more racism."
4948,What on earth does racism (or lack thereof) in Australia have to do with Singapore?
4949,Or is the message then that cleverly disguised racism is kinda ok since those acts don’t get punished?
4950,"I think something fairly interesting too is as someone who lived in the white expat bubble there's quite a lot of racism towards Singaporeans, some subtle, some less so."
4951,">If we say that Neo Nazi Skinheads who hate Jews, or KKK Members who hate Blacks, are racist merely because of ignorance, it also removes the agency and culpability from the actors."
4952,Acknowledging that racism can arise from ignorance **does not mean that all racism arises from ignorance**.
4953,"Yes, the Nazis and the KKK are racist."
4954,People who are ignorance are racist.
4955,But we can still differentiate between the two and make the value judgment that the Nazi and KKK are much **more racist** than people who are merely racist from ignorance.
4956,"That ignorance is the driver of racism, and not personal action?"
4957,"](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/05/18/which-jobs-are-most-at-risk-because-of-covid-19/amp/)  Hot take: (Yes it’s based on Europe but) If we assume the same is true irrespective of location - that lockdowns affect low income earners much more than high income - then it makes sense locals would be likelier to complain than expats, since it’s very unlikely for the lowest decile (or 8) to include expats"

4959,The character had a bomb strapped on  That's not racism.
4960,The OP's point is that racism should not be a controversial issue - it should be regarded as unambiguously bad.
4961,This can be the view even while recognizing that the causes of racism and the manner in which racism manifests is a complex social phenomena.
4962,>a cruel and mean spirited elitist and racist.
4963,Sadly I'd say plenty of us will experience racism and still not process the hypocrisy of it.

4976,">as the maid shouldn't have acted in an irritated manner,  Nope."
4977,The expat needs to adapt or leave.
4978,No investors until at least series B would be ok hiring expats on their regular paycheck.
4979,"In an ideal world, no discrimination is obviously the best alternative but unfortunately racism still exist in Singapore to this day hence there is a need for some affirmative action and positive discrimination policies like the EIP to exist to balance out the negative effects of racism."
4980,">but it sickens me that the incident reported is now being used to cheapen minorities lived experiences with facing discrimination because ""see, we Chinese also got people racist against us so STFU with your problems""  If your only takeaway from the discourse in that thread is that people are ""trying"" to ""cheapen minorities' lived experiences"", then maybe consider that you're simply projecting an ""us-vs-them"" mindset, which is now rearing its ugly head?"

4985,"Do people judge that immigration is bad for their socioeconomic wellbeing based on their actual socioeconomic wellbeing, or because of tribalism, xenophobia, and populism?"
4986,Many ppl get live in domestic helpers because of the low cost (<few dollars/hr?) .
4987,"It is the duty of the people to judge socio-economic wellbeing, independent of racist or xenophobic or sexist of colourist or ableist or immoral tendencies."
4988,"It may seem more ""racist"", but wouldn't you think, in such a mixed-up crowded soup of people, it would serve everyone well to be aware of cultural differences, avoid potentially inflammatory situations, and try to be as specific as possible?"
4989,So all 1 and half billion of them are all racists and undesirable and need to be banned?
4990,If you live and work in a place speaking the language is expected - not every local is obligated to give up his culture to please foreign workers.
4991,SG gov is probably worried about the economic impacts of maids being locked away for a month depriving poor Singaporean families of domestic helpers (LOL).

5085,""" As these FDWs continue to enjoy the protection, encouragement and support from these so-called human rights organizations to stand up against their employers, to fight for their rights and defy and rebel against their employers, who do employers have to fight for OUR rights in the face of increasing rebellion, defiance and brazenly unreasonable demands from these FDWs?"""
5086,There's even a whole section whining about human rights organizations helping FDWs too much lmao.
5087,Seeing the govt go out of their way to defend CECA or foreigners will make people like CECA or foreigners LESS.
5088,">she found out that the maid's friends and employment agency had taught her to hurt the child ""so that she could go home""  I can understand if the maid's friends came up with the idea, but even the employment agency was involved?"
5089,"Edit: And I mean, hearing out her concerns about racism, falls squarely within the PA's own self defined job scope of promoting racial harmony."
5090,>so an event of boss shouting is enough to call it quit (maids?)...
5091,>so you're saying that in this case some random former maid also named Parti Liyani would be liable for libel?
5092,>stealing my sisters clothes   How did the maid think she could get away with that?
5093,>straitstimes.com/singap...  racist ~~indian~~ malay president exercise prejudice against singapore chinese woman by not pardoning her... /s
5094,>strokes he was hoping for  Now a new maid will massage his backside.
5095,"If the people would rather live in poverty than live next to a Malay, the people is racist and wrong."
5096,"If we can identify the cause of racist/sexist tendencies, we can stop these things from persisting."
5097,">that if one is not surrounded by other races, one will turn racist?"
5098,">the Government's testing and medical strategy had helped to achieve good health outcomes for migrant workers, with the morbidity and mortality rates among them very low."
5099,Almost 50% of migrant workers having fallen ill is considered a sign that the government strategy was good?
5100,>the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms  Plenty of them are already staying at hotels.
5101,">the lorry driver was so frightened that he reversed the vehicle, causing the rear wheel to run over one of the migrant workers who had been flung out of the vehicle."
5102,">the maid shouldn't have acted in an irritated manner,  what a strange thing to say"
5103,>would it be morally acceptable for an immigrant to illegally enter singapore or illegally overstay his visa?
5104,Economics have proven that immigration increases socioeconomic wellbeing short of racist and morally wrong sentiments (i.e.
5105,>the number of cases of maids running away in the last two months has more than doubled from 13 in March to 29 in April.
5106,>the people who are not racists will have sound facts to back up their arguments  Where?
5107,"The vast majority of the time the official line on things like racial tensions or racism or things like that isn't 'guys, let's try to understand each other' as much as it is 'welp we have to live together, let's *tolerate* each other because there's no choice'."
5108,"Very often you'll hear similar sentiments echoed in things people say- or I've heard, at least- people being sort of openly dismissive or racist against other people and then justifying it or saying it's okay because they wouldn't do it to their faces / they have friends from that race so that makes it fine / they're *tolerating* them, that doesn't mean they have to *like* them."
5109,>their populist anti-immigrant u-turn  You know that tens of thousands of new citizens come in every year right.
5110,>then it was announced it doesn't affect VTL.
5111,I'm flying in on a VTL on Thursday and I'm stressing out that a positive case on the plane will put me in quarantine for 10 days due to being a close contact.
5112,>they'll need to reinstate VTLs  ~~Huh?
5113,"Only Malaysia VTL is suspended, right?~~  I was wrong."
5114,It's all VTLs
5115,">thinking back, everyone was openly making racist jokes about the non-Chinese  And if the unit is all Chinese, it's either the weakest one or the Chinese PR(Malaysian/China/Taiwan/HK/etc) who becomes the butt of the joke."
5116,">thinking back, everyone was openly making racist jokes about the non-Chinese.... even in their presence."
5117,"I think it almost impossible to completely eradicate xenophobia, but what really stands out to people is ego and looking down at others."
5118,>try own a maid.
5119,You own a maid?
5120,WTF sort of racist apologist stance is this?
5121,And this is why racism continues.
5122,"We know that racism still exist in Singapore, there are cases of landlords refusing to rent to indian tenants, hiring discrimination etc."
5123,>which part of immigration policy concerns justice and negative liberties?
5124,Old trick....many fakers who couldnt care less about migrant workers do it.
5125,">why is racism even controversial, isn't it about the rightful justice that people deserve?"
5126,activists point to the fact that black people are disproportionately killed by police as evidence of institutional racism.
5127,someone else might then counter that they only commit more crimes due to factors like poverty whose roots can be traced back to historical racism.
5128,"to address the historical racism faced by certain groups, some schools practice affirmative action which makes it easier for them to enter."
5129,">with regards to CECA allowing ""unconditional entry of Indian professionals"", would you accept CECA allowing ""free movement of professionals"" as an equivalent?"
5130,"yes the US, that xenophobic hellhole that... accepts more permanent immigrants than any other country in the world, literally has a lottery system to give away tens of thousands of green cards for the sake of diversity every year, grants legal status to illegal immigrants brought there as children, and allows birthright citizenship."
5131,"As the indiscriminate foreign employment gravy train started losing steam in the 2010s, which was around the same time Singapore became perceived as an attractive place not just to be an expat in but also to settle down, heaps of them applying for PR to no avail because of demographic quotas."
5132,"Singaporeans have always been impressed upon by the government that nobody owes us a living, but we suddenly owe the expats one?"
5133,">A lot of my black classmates were shocked when they learned this, as it is incredibly openly racist by the Singaporean govt."
5134,"Nobody's saying all of Singapore or the whole government is hyper racist or anything like that   Again, just 2 mins in that cesspool of the original thread and you will see plenty of that, that certainly is the view and narrative, definitely by the original OP as well from their comments."
5135,"The fact that you think it's 'relatively easy' despite not having a single clue on what the actual problem is beyond your presumed systematic racism on the govt's part seems to imply to me that you're not here for any discussion, nor do you care to want to truly find out the root cause, because you've already come armed with your pitch forks and your view and not willing to hear out other angles."
5136,"Even if true, an FDW wages when combined with the rent, utilities and food, is easily close to 1.5k, which is what a cleaner or lower skilled job would earn in sg."
5137,">Let's say an FDW earns the same amount, but their working hours are way longer, and they have more responsibilities (cooking, taking care of children)."
5138,"And I'm all for tougher enforcement of working conditions for FDWs, but claims of 'slavery' are not right."
5139,">They hired a domestic helper   >Yes, your parents paid for piano lessons and supported your artistic hobbies  >Your parents provide everything you ever need."
5140,It's racism.
5141,Those people are often the first ones to be extremely racist towards Chinese immigrants or anyone who still maintains cultural ties to their original Asian country.
5142,"I mean, look no further than Andrew Yang's comments about how Asian-Americans should act in the wake of Anti-Asian sentiment by racist Americans."
5143,"> A woman allegedly punched her domestic helper's eyes and struck them with objects such as clothes hangers, causing permanent damage to the victim's sight."
5144,"Ummi Kalsum Ali is also accused of pressing a heated iron on the maid's forearm repeatedly, and slapping her on her face and ears."
5145,"> The caricature of the European sipping a gin and tonic under a shady tree with rent and school fees taken care of, pampered by maids, is woefully out of date."
5146,Relocation company staff say the glory days of the expat packages ended with the global financial crisis.
5147,"If you wanna move somewhere else, be ready and willing to pay for it all, like how immigrants from third world countries have always done."
5148,">“In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said."
5149,">“It’s just one of many ways in which Singapore showed it’s not super friendly to expats, and that they will always prioritise their own citizens ahead of foreigners,” the consultant, who wished to remain anonymous, said."
5150,"Uh, so the government is not responsible for our immigration policy?"
5151,">“The construction industry needs migrant workers as they form the backbone of the labour force, and the majority of these workers are from India and Bangladesh."
5152,">“The reality is that the industry needs sufficient inflow of migrant workers, both returning and new ones to take over the place of those who have left Singapore for various reasons, in order to sustain the industry and ensure that we can deliver on our projects.”  We need to change this ""reality."""
5153,"I think if anything, this article just shows how the construction industry (& perhaps a few others) are suffering from withdrawal symptoms to their addiction to migrant workers."
5154,"It's more a case of racist xenophobes make noise, we need votes"
5155,">“We have to be careful about it because we don’t want to create a situation where the domestic helpers come in and have the mindset of ‘I don’t like it, I will keep moving’,” she said."
5156,"Why do, say, accountants or dentists have the right to change jobs if they don't like it but domestic helpers don't?"
5157,">”She has gone back to her previous self as a non-maid abuser,"" defence counsel Joseph Chen added."
5158,">”She has gone back to her previous self as a non-maid abuser,"" defence counsel Joseph Chen added."
5159,If firing the maid was simple she would have done it.
5160,So let's say shes hating on a thief who isn't a maid.
5161,I don't see how liberals in Singapore paying attention to causes overseas is remotely comparable to radicalized teenagers posting racist vitriol on social media 🤔
5162,than if maid kena and pass on to employer?
5163,not everyone treats their maid like shit.
5164,Maybe don't go around being racist to strangers?
5165,"Two foreign workers die in a span of weeks - RIP, thoughts and prayers, lorry driven by workers themsves."
5166,"But yes flaws are there but this generation of youths exposed the internet i believe the next gen will be less xenophobic ,more global minded."
5167,"A better title could be ""Pre-departure ART replaces PCR test when coming back to Singapore via VTL."""
5168,Maybe we can be furnished with the data on number of sexual assault crimes carried out by migrant workers as compared to locals per capital.
5169,It will help to reduce such “discrimination” or more of protectionism from parents that are dubious of migrant workers if the numbers are indeed lower.
5170,A bit of racism among the people is beneficial to our leaders
5171,"A bit off track but working mothers also have exclusive parenthood tax reliefs like [WMCR](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/Working-Mother-s-Child-Relief--WMCR-/), [GCR](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/Grandparent-Caregiver-Relief/) and [FDWL Relief](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/Foreign-Domestic-Worker-Levy--FDWL--Relief/)."
5172,"A bit rusty, but I'll try:  > Did the immigrant population (Chinese, Indians and Eurasians) see themselves as a part of this island (ie a citizen/Singaporean) or were their allegiance still to their home country?"
5173,"No, yes, very true especially for the recent Chinese immigrants."
5174,A bonus for Jurong East/Chinese Gardens: the Lakeside campus of the Canadian International School is located here so there are quite a number of Canadian expats nearby!
5175,A braindead racist unable to see how his racist beliefs are racist.
5176,"A colleague uses this, or a similar service: http://www.singexpat.tv  I've also heard you can buy Android boxes in Sim Lim set up for streaming loads of channels"
5177,"A common argument against the view that Singapore exploits foreign domestic workers is ""they earn less here but it's worth a lot back home"", so hopefully this debunks that notion"
5178,"We want to socialize, maids also want to socialize."
5179,"Good luck with maids asking their employers, can I take my off day on Tuesday because my friend is also asking for Tuesday off."
5180,"Just advise maids to stick to small groups, that they could be fined for being caught in large groups, and advise them to explore different parts of Singapore instead of crowding at the same popular spots."
5181,A country made of immigrants wants to gate keep other immigrants?
5182,"* You cannot apply for a green card when on a H1B1, as it's a non-immigrant visa."
5183,A disappointing response from PA that fails to empathise with the recent uproar over everyday racism in Singapore   1.
5184,I agree with PA that this incident is  not racist.
5185,"PA’s racial stereotype is without doubt objectionable, but not necessarily racist."
5186,We should protect the distinct moral opprobrium of the accusation of racism from conceptual inflation and moral overload.
5187,"Significantly, the cultural insensitivity that underlines this incident is the basis of many forms of everyday racism that minorities experience in Singapore."
5188,"Perhaps, we wanted PA to adopt a broader commitment to promoting racial harmony in Singapore, that is, participating in community conversations on racial issues and, ideally, recognising state institutions and policies that may perpetuate everyday racism (yes, it’s a tall order)."
5189,A domestic helper really isn't the best person to take care of a terminally ill patient.
5190,https://www.google.com.sg/url?q=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wanted-maid-or-master-of-all-trades&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwiz34r3tJXUAhUDQI8KHf81DNoQFggYMAM&sig2=8oVX7i3Dfk5VIPLRzv_ZNA&usg=AFQjCNENBX-sLOTveWRY_ASwmuvuC4miNA
5191,A fair lot of maids come here because agents promised “big money”.
5192,A father of one friend of mine was recently diagnosed with glioblastoma and is looking for a domestic helper who is experienced in taking care of him.
5193,There are no reasons to not want to be a roommate with a person solely due to their race without any racist connotations.
5194,"By asking the ""asker"" is either racist himself or thinks that the person he is asking is racist."
5195,"Only way to tell is to ask but the thing with Singaporeans is will admit that as a people we are racist but the individual himself for example me would never say    ""Yes i am definitely racist, i think a chinese/malay guy should definitely not be roommates with indians but since it's your money i'll let you decide"""
5196,Theres a hollandse club in singapore that the dutch expat community hangs out.
5197,"This applies to every human by the way, but just foreign workers."
5198,"A few points: 1) allowing migrant workers to come out, will cause the same public furor."
5199,"Given the wider spread among dormitory workers, the probability of having asymptomatic cases is higher."
5200,They have to run small pilot tests before they can just allow all migrant workers to leave their dorms.
5201,It's just not something the government uses to classify people unlike CMIO.
5202,"Two parents, two children(about 10yrs old) and a maid."
5203,"The dad was on the phone, the mom had her arms crossed while watching the maid put shoes on one of her kids."
5204,The kids were not making it easy on the maid.
5205,"Best part was this, on top of being a huge hassle to the maid by purposely dropping things pulling on her hair and not sitting still, one of them hit her on the head with her shoe then threw the shoe away, which the maid then quickly fetched."
5206,"Instead of telling the kids ""don't be a dick"" she kept asking the maid in a very annoyed voice if she's packed this and that."
5207,"Don't loose sight of what the biggest issues are which they refuse to let go - 5 (or even 8) person limit, masks outdoors, VTLs, TT/SE."
5208,I told her about VTL.
5209,He whacked it up to $3800 and an expat Indian and his family took it.
5210,So now Indian expats have to pay a premium?
5211,"A friend recently went to work in Singapore as a maid, and because of covid the family that she went to work for had to pay $2000 for all the covid tests and quarantine (she tested positive for COVID when  they tested her in Singapore, and had to quarantine for 3 weeks in total before she started working)."
5212,It is so boring and most of us don't realise it makes us look like a pack of dribbling racists.
5213,It was these sentiments that helped trump win with his racist narrative.
5214,"For expats in general, these are not easy decisions to make, well knowing the stringent, and reasonable, regulations Signapore has for re-entry."
5215,"Friends are not able to hire for their teams from local talent poola, so there is definitely a need for foreign talent."
5216,"I'm interested in understanding if there has been a marked deterioration in the situation during the pandemic, or whether bots (I'll not speculate as to which country might be behind this) are driving and amplifying the social media racism."
5217,And definitely better working conditions for those at the lowest end of the economic ladder to worker passholders and maids.
5218,Someone pls think of the poor expats 🙄
5219,"A great article, giving a different perspective to the ever increasing xenophobia here...   *edit* also, to add on after some further thought: there is no easy way out of the current situation."
5220,"I think transparency could offer an avenue out of this dilemma: they can make painful rules and regulations to restrict foreign workers, but they need to be sensible, forward-looking and above all transparent."
5221,A group of foreign workers boarded the bus the other day and they literally smelled better than the sweaty singaporeans.
5222,https://www.helperplace.com/blog/useful-resources-maids-singapore
5223,A hot topic of late is how migrant worker dorm operators will simply increase costs to the consumer if government regulation is introduced to improve the living conditions of migrant workers.
5224,"I'm fairly ignorant about economics and the workings of the migrant worker industry here, so I'd love to read an answer explaining why I'm wrong."
5225,"At some point-and I think we have gone past it-this is a net loss to Singapore with migrant workers opting not to work here, and massive delays in construction projects."
5226,A junior level fresh grad PMET is not an “expat” lol.
5227,Not posting racists ads isn't the only way these businesses interact with the public.
5228,"Not posting racist ads is an irrelevant point to make, esp."
5229,if those racist sentiments are merely going to be passed on indirectly through the agents or in their client selection process.
5230,"A large majority of Singaporeans treat their domestic helpers like trash, property or children."
5231,Always shocked when I see how my friends and their parents treat their domestic helpers.
5232,The domestic helpers employed by my parents when we young were lucky cos we treated each and every one of them like really part of family.
5233,"Only thing I feel bad when I think back my mum did not allow the Muslim domestic helper we had, to pray."
5234,"A large part of the resentment in the UK and other western nations is the misconceived idea that lots of migrant workers come from third world countries, don't assimilate and get welfare (even though statistics show the average migrant pays substantially more in taxes over their lifetime than they receive in benefits)."
5235,"I feel that a lot of that idea comes from senior expats, who are often given amazing living arrangements, high six or even seven figure comp packages, cars etc."
5236,These people make up a disproportionate amount of the expat population and thus give people the idea that white expats are treated better than locals.
5237,"A little context beforehand, I am a singaporean born here and my fiancée is a work permit holder."
5238,( MOM requires all work permit holders to obtain a letter of approval from them prior to the marriage) We didn’t think much of it as I thought I can just call ROM in the morning and ask if they really need the letter cause we were already approved and I’m sure it’s in MOM’s record somewhere and if that didn’t work out I can always just go to MOM and get them to reprint the letter.
5239,Family of 3 and their maid.
5240,"VTLs no longer make sense when ~90% of our prospective arrivals are doubly vaxxed by default, and we’ll likely impose VDM at the point of entry next"
5241,I find a lot of people find Asians in Australia fine where it seems middle easten of indian get more racism put on them.
5242,A lot of domestic helpers work their butts off here and their relatives back home merely treat them like ATMs.
5243,A lot of expats not planning on coming back...
5244,"A lot of filipino maids do this sort of shit - like the case a few years ago of the hotwife, [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/employer-acquitted-allowing-maid-stand-2nd-storey-glass-awning-clean-it](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/employer-acquitted-allowing-maid-stand-2nd-storey-glass-awning-clean-it),  The flippies are smart, they take any job to get into Singapore, their preferred employers are:  1."
5245,"As for the Arabs, that’s coz Chinese, Malay, and Tamil are the 3 primary mother tongues so it’s much easier to get education for it in schools."
5246,A lot of my colleagues are expats and they work really hard and long hours.
5247,They paid 2k for quarantine and had to reincur the same and the same (imagine if the next maid also does the same)  2.	most people who hire maid had a need.
5248,"A lot of people think just because the salary they earned is a lot in their countries, they are actually paying “too much” for their FDW."
5249,"These people need to think, FDWs are doing more diverse task, way more hours, and have a higher KPI compared to say fastfood workers, yet their pay are like half of full time of these workers not even considering benefits."
5250,Even their kids can do part time during school/NS years and still take home more than these FDWs.
5251,I doubt you'll find many HR people or senior management who thinks they'll pay an expat worker more for being expat.
5252,You can also see if the NGO focusing on the foreign workers need help.
5253,"A lot of racists out there aye, quite ironic to be living in this multi cultural and race nation but racist do come in all shape and sizes."
5254,A lot of singaporeans in very respectable professions basically hate all foreigners  They're getting paid too much/getting paid too little and spoiling market/taking singaporean jobs that no singaporean wants to do/marrying singaporean men/marrying singaporean women/dirty construction workers who do work that no singaporean wants to do/maids who clean our houses and our babies asses   I hear this on a regular basis at work and just smh
5255,A lot of the commentators are expats enjoying privileges.
5256,It certainly doesn't help that those who criticise government policy on this are also smeared as being xenophobic.
5257,Anger always finds an outlet and the low hanging fruit happens to be foreign talent.
5258,This is an issue and idc if anyone calls me xenophobic but those Chinese immigrants need to be assimilated to our culture and respect non-Chinese minorities.
5259,A lot of these maid abusers love to cite mental illness when caught and charged.
5260,"The expat, not the government."
5261,A maid is one example of foreign worker not staying in a dorm.
5262,"There are diseases which have had silly names or acronyms ([BOOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogenic_organizing_pneumonia)), or were formerly named after Nazi war criminals ([granulomatosis with polyangitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulomatosis_with_polyangiitis)) or were named after places leading to racist idiots acting out."
5263,I don't see why being disagreeable with the Govt suddenly equals xenophobic.
5264,"I think trivializing real problems faced by singaporeans of all races because a few are deeply racist, while acting to use this terrible incident to whitewash govt error  is also wrong."
5265,"I never said to ""ignore racism"" in any of my writings, did I."
5266,After he changes his name he is called expat.
5267,Our openness to foreign talent and investment has become more of a bane than a boon.
5268,Didn't felt it was racist or demeaning at all.
5269,"A redditor once said that xenophobic Americans invented the word ""expat"" because they see the irony."
5270,A relative had a maid who stole stuff and fucked off many years ago.
5271,Who has actually had a maid who stole something and then had the authorities so diligently follow up through the prosecution and various round of court hearing?
5272,"If both agency and employer go through their due process then you minimize the risk of getting a maid who isn't worth the dosh but all parties must accept that you open your door to a stranger, you immediately up the risk of something going astray."
5273,A rise in nationalism and racism is happening all over the world because of social media in my opinion.
5274,Imagine if an entire city was racist and excluded all Indians from entering any store of any kind or any private property.
5275,A simple solution would be to impose a larger tax on foreign workers as a % of their salary instead of some cheap useless levy.
5276,A maid is paid and willingly enters employment.
5277,"To conclude, in an ideal Singapore, I would like to see a strong Singaporean-core, complemented with the best foreign talents."
5278,Are you racist?
5279,He said he hates all Christians and used other racist terms for non-chinese people.
5280,"No fat paychecks, no expat packages, no housing provided etc."
5281,I may be in the wrong industry for high concentration of expats though (i.e.
5282,"In many other countries, attaining citizenship or PR requires demonstrating that you at least have made an attempt at integrating in the country (like OP's language test examples, or needing to live in the country for a certain number of years), whereas in sg you literally just gotta bring in big bucks and not have to put in any effort at integrating at all."
5283,"A year on, the government is yet to deliver a strategy or plan to prevent another outbreak within the migrant worker community."
5284,Locking up migrant workers solves the problem for them I guess.
5285,"As I mention, I don’t condone racism but I also understand landlord who has a preference in their personal life."
5286,"A-fucking-men, am a Filipino and i've had more than my fair share of maid jokes that it made me hide the fact that I'm a Filipino when people ask about my race."
5287,"A: If you look down on Indians it’s racist, look down on neighborhood school its elitist."
5288,Person A is not racist for asking.
5289,Person B is racist despite that being his own personal preferance.
5290,Person A is not racist for asking.
5291,Person B is not racist and does not have a race preference to his/her roommate.
5292,"You are such a racist, whats wrong with indians?"
5293,Person A is not racist for asking.
5294,Person A is acting in accordance to societal norm as there are racists out there would will object to being in any space with a specific race.
5295,Is our society racist?
5296,"Of course, a society is a collective and as long there there are racist folks in our midst, it is."
5297,AFAIK these are the first VTL countries with no Singapore Airlines flights.
5298,"SQ used to fly to Stockholm via Moscow, maybe they'll restart this via another VTL country?"
5299,"That is long before CECA was a thing, so the label makes no sense in any way except as a EDMW style comment."
5300,I almost think the racist comments about CECA are meant to be a distraction from the main issue.
5301,"Shouldn't go patrol, must help runaway maids instead."
5302,"Also, maids are allowed to leave the house for all the same reasons that Singaporeans are."
5303,Unlike maids who’s bosses will pay the price at the end of the day.
5304,Abolish slavery; no more maids for Sinkies
5305,"Like your mum, my mum was eager to send me to a SAP school because she believed that it could give me a better learning environment to master my mother tongue (MT)."
5306,"With the exception of my school's old Chinese history, moto - I will one day make my school proud (ok giving away the identity of my school), 1 Chinese painting and 1 tea appreciation classes, there are no specific traditional Chinese values that were taught.. My question to you on whether traditional Malay and Indian values and languages should be taught is if you have to teach 4-8 school topics to a child or teen that has a limited attention span, how do you chose between the child's mother tongue and other languages or culture?"
5307,I suspect my mum and your mum are probably (a little) racist (and this was the trigger why I sprung into action to reply).
5308,"About midway down the report, we find this:   > The incident involving Mr Parkash and Ms Ho, which is being investigated by the police, has also sparked discussion about whether Singapore's longstanding CMIO - Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others - classification framework may be an issue."
5309,"The correspondent brings up the CMIO categories and leaves the issue hanging, and moves on immediately to religion."
5310,"Presumably the CMIO issue wasn't a question posed to Shan during the interview, which I haven't listened to."
5311,But what would be possible answers if one were to apply Shan's own rubrics to evaluate if the imposition of the CMIO categories 'crosses the line'?
5312,Are the CMIO categories preferences?
5313,Are the CMIO categories *overt*?
5314,Honestly I consider just about anyone to be racist to a certain degree.
5315,Is that really such a taboo and unnatural thing as much as how the word 'racism' has become just a buzzword?
5316,Racist vs not racist.
5317,"But the main problem isnt that they were abusing the maid, but that they were caught doing it."
5318,"Just when VTLs are supposedly about to be in full swing due to the festive year end period, now the Omicron shaped spectre looms over the world and blots out the sun."
5319,Absolutely chilling how calm the racist guy was when spewing all of that.
5320,Absolutely no racism?!
5321,Or you have not experienced any racism?
5322,"Also, I am quite dubious about the zero fatalities amongst the foreign workers."
5323,"On no particular order:  - Being disrespectful to support staff like recruiters, admins, security, cantina staff, and peers, especially when they are women or minority race (can't contain your racism, don't bother applying in an MNC) ."
5324,"And about the Indians being racist, I find this true especially for Sikhs/North Indians."
5325,"Why do maids come here to work, even though some might actually have education?"
5326,"According to MOM regulations, “If your FDW agrees to work on her rest day, you must compensate her with one of the following: At least 1 day’s salary, [or] a replacement rest day taken within the same month”."
5327,"According to https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/rapid-growth-singapores-immigrant-population-brings-policy-challenges, there were 870,000 low skilled workers including FDWs and construction workers in 2010."
5328,"According to latest requirements you can go Germany, travel to Switzerland and then fly back from Germany on a VTL flight."
5329,"Even if our testing ability is ramped up to 5000 tests a day just for foreign workers, it would take 2 months to test them all."
5330,Or should the employer rate the foreign baseline according to the foreign worker levy rebate?
5331,"However, those entering Korea from abroad will not be permitted to board domestic connecting flights (i.e., to Jeju or Busan) until completing government-mandated quarantine.”  Since we are not applicable for quarantine anymore, I presume as long as you can get in successfully with the VTL, shouldn’t be a problem."
5332,"Makes me wonder, how young is the crowd here to be unable to accept a basic fact of life, that this casual racism is a part of the human condition."
5333,The ironic thing is that - the minority groups who scream racism and oppression are themselves oppressing other minority groups.
5334,"When I see this happening, I cannot see why I should bother with fighting racism."
5335,whcih then led to the explosion in cases in the dormitory?
5336,Actual good news that move the needle on migrant workers' welfare.
5337,Specifically the parts relating to racism is from Page 54 to Page 57
5338,On the maid's part there seems to be at least some genuine belief by her that she had to lie in order to go back to Indonesia.
5339,"Apart from CECA related reasons I keep seeing on Mothership.sg, why is there a sudden rise in racism particularly towards Indians in general?"
5340,"(And I'd be more shocked (and if there are plenty of) the younger the racist gets, as over the years of living here and mingling with the locals, I thought people of my age will be anti-racist even more."
5341,I nearly do not hear any stereotypes that leads to their racism towards a certain race.
5342,What changes for current VTL countries?
5343,Can take any flights and not restricted to VTL flights isit?
5344,"Actually I find if you've been abroad you know how racist people can get, lol."
5345,"Like in the paragraph about the foreign workers not being able to meet any friends for an entire year - MOM's response was that they had some scheme to have 7000 workers participate in ""outings""."
5346,There are 300 thousand foreign workers living in dorms in Singapore.
5347,"Actually I think it's because many Singaporeans are racist in their mind, but can't express it out of fear."
5348,"Some people don't behave like racists because it's wrong, others don't because they are afraid of the consequences that they will have to face."
5349,"So when they get too see racism from other people, they respond by saying there's nothing wrong with it."
5350,Why are work permit holders not living in dormitories counted separate from local cases or dormitory cases?
5351,Are these cases part of the local community spread or part of the dormitory spread?
5352,"Are the group classified under work permit holders not living in dorms: linked to dorm cases, suspected to be linked to dorm cases, or linked to local cases?"
5353,"Ambiguity does not help when there are work permit holders entirely unrelated to construction worksites and dorms, and their infection could point to a greater community spread, which would be worrying."
5354,"Actually KLM, Air France and BA also offer VTL flights to SG."
5355,If I'm not wrong BA flights from UK on VTL are daily (so more than SQ).
5356,"But in any case, VTL flight prices are inflated due to limited numbers which would definitely help SQ's P&L"
5357,"You get the high flying expats yes, but a lot of them live in condos and HDBs further out."
5358,"Melville Park is full of Indian expats, Yishun has a lot of Indian expats too, lots of Americans in Woodlands."
5359,Even among the high flyers it's increasingly difficult- my kid goes to a kindergarten with a large expat population and only the really rich ones can think about affording Tanglin or UWC.
5360,The expats have their sandwiched class too.
5361,"Actually for a wage of 2.5k, foreign worker levy is 400."
5362,"Actually for construction, the reliance for foreign workers is partially because [constructions firms are reluctant to adopt new technologies](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/some-builders-not-keen-to-be-first-movers-in-ppvc) because it requires upfront capital that they don't want to do spend until govn't demanded they use it."
5363,"Actually from what I've seen (as a minority not from the 4 major races) is that the majority race tends to feel that everything is okay there's no racism, (I'll just be frank) it is also the majority race attacking the others based on their race....the majority race barely feel anything towards them hence they feel racism doesn't exist"
5364,"Since we want to play the what if game, what if those expats were asymptomatic carriers and zhao in his infinite wisdom got them to wear a mask thus limiting the spread of the disease?"
5365,"Meaning they want to destroy the usual mommy,daddy and children system and widespread the LGBTQ++ community  Yes I agree that racism shouldn't be tolerated in any shape or form."
5366,"But seeing what the BLMers do and the damage they deal, you can really tell that the system is messed up and they're not actually fighting  for anything morally right..In fact they're turning into racists themselves."
5367,Actually i don't think its racism THAT much most people who rent out rooms are older people and they sometimes only speak their own language so they feel more comfortable with a same language speaking person.
5368,"Renting aside, YES there is too much xenophobia and racism here and most of that resides only."
5369,Actually if not for covid I don't think migrant workers rank dorm quality high on their list of concerns   Not to say that there aren't systemic issues that need improving
5370,"""Former domestic worker"" might be better."
5371,Actually it is the maid's fault for breaking contract.
5372,"Exactly, they accepted and agreed to a contract that was then broken unilaterally by the maid."
5373,Even most generic employment contracts require 3 months notice (which I presume is why the maid was able to get a 3 month advance in the first place).
5374,"Personally, I think the maid handled this very unprofessionally."
5375,Actually it’s not about the operators not wanting to give the residents decent life ....it’s really about social pressures   I think general public will eventually find it absurd to provide so much facilities or personal space for a ‘construction worker’ (honestly many consider it as pariah job)  We already have seen the faces of few masters on how they treat their maids.
5376,We will here lots of grumpy voices of how one has to stay in a tiny expensive HdB Yet a foreign worker get low cost ‘home’ and need not pay CPF.
5377,"I’ve been there a couple times and it’s often used as an “oi, Chinese guy, look at me I’m talking to you” kind of tone, so even if it’s not racist it’s incredibly rude."
5378,U may say Singaporeans are very snobbish towards maids but I ‘d say Indonesians and Filipinos citizens themselves have a even more unforgiving caste system and treat their maids even more like slaves.
5379,There is an even deeper divide there as the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor and the maids are usually not even treated that well and definitely not as family.
5380,"It’s in the nature to try and get the best out of hire to feel like save money or being efficient   Lots of maids help out family restaurants .some times willing party at either end   And some people appear very good outside but behave inhumanly to waiters ,taxi drivers,interns and house-helpers"
5381,I’m not sure why one would take pride for their country to be unattractive to foreign workers.
5382,This case is collusion between the maid and ex-employer to game the system.
5383,The cases are now mostly affecting the dormitory and most of us have limited contact with them.
5384,"I have done professional facade maintenance work, the amount of training and equipment that is needed is just not viable for most domestic helpers."
5385,"Actually that would be great😂  I would think that racist landlords might also be the kind that will over the smallest things, or have lot of extra rules that they want their tenants to follow."
5386,"When people complain about CECA, did you think they were only complaining about the top executives?"
5387,"It’s also disingenuous to suggest that expats have it “harder”, that 10k for them doesn’t have the same value."
5388,The oft-touted logic that one who has experienced racism before would appreciate racism in any of its forms should logically apply then.
5389,"Actually the VTP application process is what the govt uses to control the number of ppl entering, not the VTL flights."
5390,So basically you can anyhow buy a flight ticket on a VTL flight but be refused boarding cos you don't have a valid VTP
5391,"My point is, it's not reversible like this and this sort of behaviour is basic ignorance or racism or classism."
5392,"Actually the entire idea of ""pushing Singaporeans"" is market regulation - if free market forces were allowed to play out, SMEs would simply continue to hire foreign workers (there's still 2 million of them in Singapore), up until that is not possible, and then slowly take on Singaporean staff that are willing to work at rates which are close to the foreign worker rate."
5393,Actually the whole country “benefits” from ill treatment of foreign workers.
5394,"Actually this makes sense, tie the cap to exact number of foreign workers - construction and domestic imported from each country."
5395,"Got 50k FW and FDW, allot 50k EP."
5396,"In MNCs context, it is considered post tax income, so he is right to say that, damn as a singaporean coming back I do not get to access that cash amt cos it got throw into cpf whereas expats get that amount in case under post tax income after equalisation."
5397,So he is also right to say as a Singaporean leaving the country on a tax equalized expat package will help you access that amount as cash since the company wants to be fair to you for that 37% that should have belonged to you.
5398,"Citizens and expats are already travelling, they just have to serve a quarantine period when they return ?"
5399,I don't see it as racism.
5400,I think we use the word racism too much to bully people and put them down instead of acknowledging they got legitimate reason to fear.
5401,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/11mcuz/frustratedshould_i_stay_here_will_i_ever_be/  https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2j0247/foreigners_in_singapore_what_do_you_dislike_most/?ref=search_posts  And this isn't reddit but saw this too: http://www.xojane.com/issues/racism-in-singapore
5402,There are 3 general phases of xenophobia in the online community.
5403,"Actually you can't, not because of xenophobic."
5404,"I do not actually believe that I am racist, because my negative feelings are caused by external circumstance rather than a specific race."
5405,I hope the right balance can be struck because I want to be able to wholeheartedly appreciate our foreign talents and their contribution to Singapore.
5406,"And now, they announce the VTL flight."
5407,"Malays call Chinese racists, then Chinese call Malays racist (Nasi padang makcik etc.)"
5408,"Actually, for these foreign workers to even be able to come to Singapore to work..., I think they literally gotta actually have some kind of money first, like at least 2 to 3k SGD?"
5409,I am local but live in an “expat” neighbourhood.
5410,"The basic premise of your argument seems to be *""it's not a good move because sometimes, it isn't racism""* and the underlying concern you present seems to be *""and what happens when it actually isn't racism, but people are out for blood?"
5411,"Yep, sometimes a cruel act or word of phrase isn't racism."
5412,Ex-Navy lady didn't do anything racist.
5413,"Anyways, how is this racism?"
5414,"Actually, nowhere in my comment did I attribute this incident to “racism”."
5415,The government collected foreign worker levies of 2 billion dollars.
5416,So they wouldn't be subject to this language test.
5417,"Actually, the expats I know buy properties back home coz that’s where they’re going back to."
5418,"On top of that, singaporeans by and large are quite willing to accept the fruits of slave labour (just look at how it took a pandemic for the general public to give two hoots about our foreign worker dorms)  Rightly or wrongly, singaporeans are very sensitive to issues of race, religion and sexual assault."
5419,"Actually, thinking about it, I recall a motherjones article on this years ago that I can't seem to find now but I did find this which suggests that rising cost and additional worker rights for domestic helpers contributed to the decrease in popularity of it."
5420,https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/decline-domestic-help-maid/406798/
5421,She didn't outright accuse PA of being racists.
5422,"Actually, what makes you think that the chinese man's behaviour was due to racism?"
5423,"It may seem we are underpaying FDWs, but my FDW recently said that with six months of wages, she can buy enough land and build a big house for her entire immediate family."
5424,"Im not saying exploitation of FDWs doesnt occur, but saying FDWs are underpaid is abit simplistic"
5425,I can write it as   Man's quick thinking saves his helper from serious injury  Or   Man saves maid from escalator mishap  Or   Man saves maid from escalating escalator injury
5426,"Added to this- if you exclude a certain part of the population (in this case foreigners/expats) from vaccination, then your population as a whole is being held back from herd immunity."
5427,"Adding a couple of countries to the VTL list for Singaporeans to travel out, helps in easing the frustration of the crowd that’s most pro-reopening (generally better educated, higher income people according to IPS research)  Keeping the restrictions at home appeals to the 80% of voting base that believes restrictions are appropriate, or don’t go far enough (IPS research and Miles Insight survey)"
5428,"Advertisements that were racist, sexist, homophobic, islamophobic etc."
5429,Afaik the retrial is only indicated for mother tongue if you repeat the test at end of year (instead of 1st test at beginning).
5430,Affirmative action isn't systemic racism.
5431,It's an attempt to *counter* systemic racism.
5432,"After all this is over, the real losers will be the employers of those migrant workers."
5433,The laws will very likely be updated to care more for migrant workers.
5434,After jail can still hire new maid right?
5435,"Outside of the super low wage foreign workers from india/bangladesh, the wage for decently skilled operators in manufacturing and engineering is high enough to pay a local."
5436,"Think of it as, reverse racism."
5437,"After reading through the facebook post, I think this entire episode is more a grievance of miscommunication on Prima Deli's part, rather than one of racism."
5438,"""*  What he said may hint of racism because he threw in the ""Malay"" at the start, but as a whole his comment strikes me as something spoken from genuine experience rather than as an off-hand racist remark."
5439,"After seeing immigrants receive so much shit from people on the (rest of the) internet, I would really like to see how you guys view this situation."
5440,* Why do you think Singaporean's are so xenophobic towards them?
5441,And now they want to start with the xenophobic demagoguery.
5442,"By the way, I'm enlisted into one of the other two companies, and the men there openly recite the same statistics you wrote about, before being low-key racist towards me too."
5443,"It really goes both ways, retaliatory racism is racism too."
5444,"Some of the themes were around the harsh schooling system, too many foreign talents, parental pressure, losing bilingual skills, etc"
5445,"After watching the party debate broadcast (1st July) and the recent constituency broadcast (3rd July), there might be a huge disparity in the speakers' command of English, Singapore's working lanuage, as well as their mother tongue."
5446,"I know it is a fact that most political discourse in Parliament is in English, but should parties' members improve their command in mother tongue?"
5447,"Hopefully, the languishing state of our mother tongue shouldn't be a norm in political debates/broadcasts."
5448,"After years of volunteering to help FDWs and FWs being abused, I'm honestly astonished that that isn't a dyslexic typo."
5449,"In Singapore of course we thankfully don't have the historical baggage of violent racism, but the fact remains that prejudice is way more complex than violent racism."
5450,Same for FDWs.
5451,That's absolutely not racist and the right way forward in your world?
5452,"If these 3 sources were the only pieces referencing racism, then PA's accusation that Sarah is implying racism is a lot more contentious."
5453,My previous response only aimed to counter the implication in the main post that the PA is attempting to gaslight the public into falsely believing that Sarah viewed the PA incident as a racist one.
5454,My only objective was to justify how it was reasonable for PA to assume that Sarah was accusing them of racism.
5455,"Again, I mentioned that CECA did not apply to migrant workers so I was not saying that there are construction jobs open that locals can take."
5456,"I know our welfare as foreign workers do not matter since we are not Singaporeans, and that’s fine."
5457,"Again, I only commented what I commented in response to a comment thread that declared that their intentions ""behind posting such a statement cannot be anything else other than the poster being a xenophobic asshole taking advantage of the current crisis to unleash his very unpolitically correct point of view on a (relatively) safe platform"" and I was tackling that specifically and not the general issue at large."
5458,"I don't think racism is justified, but I don't think indiscriminate condemnation is justified either, if not a little hypocritical."
5459,I agree with you that his base are full of racists.
5460,"Besides, maids are not slaves or household servants."
5461,This dismissive attitude to what is now a huge part of the economy and only going to grow by magnitudes says more about why Singapore has so many foreign workers than any immigration policy.
5462,"In my experience, most people agree with the actions being taken for the most part, but there's definitely a subset of expats - the typical here-for-two-years young crowd who came here to experience Asia and travel/party around that feels fucked over by life."
5463,"What this low benchmark leads to, is a very low level of responsibility expected of people to actually make an effort to know people of another culture, or worst, it may lead to people being happy of having achieved the intended goals, and be blind to racism that is just in front of them (eg."
5464,"""I'm not racist cos I eat Malay food"", or ""I'm not racist cos I have Indian Neighbours"")  Tolerance can always run out."
5465,"Again, my point is sexism is different from racism."
5466,"You may disagree (and I would love to see any research that supports that racism is conceptually the same as sexism), but the academic research texts done in this area seem to agree that they are different and one cannot compare the two in the same way."
5467,It’s like people read some anecdotal stuff and suddenly the whole of Singapore is xenophobic and there are no expats ever allowed.
5468,"Even the recent articles show that employment passes were still issued, just that an appeal was required."
5469,"While, as you can see, I think that this subreddit and Singapore in general are becoming more xenophobic, you cannot even compare that with Japanese xenophobia."
5470,"Again, the covid problem being intrinsically tied to the foreign worker dorm problem means it is deserving of our national attention."
5471,"Our citizens' livelihoods are tied to the covid problem reducing sufficiently to resume some semblance of business functioning - hence, our citizens' livelihoods are tied to the foreign worker dorm problem."
5472,2) The migrant workers are at fault for ignoring the rules?
5473,I would treat my maid as I would wish to be treated myself.
5474,Definitely doesn’t mean that there’s no racism.
5475,"Also, I’m not surprised if a lot of his “friends” have internalised racism, and thus giving his line of thoughts more legitimacy."
5476,Point of the outrage against the racist ad is to raise awareness.
5477,There are people facing against racist behaviour daily.
5478,This might restore faith in the PAP to elderly whouno might have been disillusioned by their immigration policy but could harden and spread resentment against the party among younger voters more severly impacted by the restrictions.
5479,Agent can choose not to work with racist landlords.
5480,"And by expats I’m including all foreign workers, not just EP holders."
5481,Agree I have never heard any expat getting this kind of salary a year.. the senior level expats that I know are in range of 200K so where are these misleading figures coming from?
5482,Agree it's not racist.
5483,"Some ignorant people are racist, and most racists are ignorant."
5484,but one can make a mistake about another race without being a racist.
5485,"Agree it's pretty strange now, since the requirements for VTL and non-VTL are basically the same as well."
5486,Agree that measures for protection aren't xenophobic.
5487,That's a little xenophobic I think?
5488,I'm not crazy to say that it's a little xenophobic?
5489,Many folks seem unable to decouple xenophobia with protective measures.
5490,To call it racist is too far fetched.
5491,I don’t think racist landlords are outliers in Singapore at all.
5492,They come here and defend their practices and distinguishes it from “Chinese guy yelling racist tropes at Indian in public”.
5493,It is racism.
5494,They are just arguing that they have a right to be racist because they are landlords.
5495,"Agree with most of your points, disagree that it's labelled as racism."
5496,"Racism is always a sensitive topic, and I think tagging on all that implied baggage with the word always serve to muddy up the water in terms of how to actually deal with full blown racist thoughts and ideology."
5497,"Whatever side you take, or how right or wrong you think the lifestyle is, there is a fundamental incompatibility between the life government is asking ppl to live and the life (particularly western expats) want to live."
5498,If the Govt can no longer accommodate the expat lifestyle then they’ll have to accept Singapore just won’t be able to attract those ppl in the same way places like Dubai will continue to.
5499,"PA might be way too blunt and removed any nuance from their statements, but OP is proposing very specific interpretations of Sarah's statements to exonerate her of racism."
5500,"To argue that ""in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents which have been filmed)"" is not saying ""this incident is racist"" is not credible."
5501,"My grandfather had dementia and he started hitting my grandma, the maid, and anyone that came into his path really."
5502,"Agree with this.Sure there will always be good & bad maids,but we still have to treat them with respect."
5503,However it appalled me that there some minority owner who mistreated their maids for minor issues.
5504,I know elderly care are very hard to take care & some elderly take maids for granted.
5505,Some elderly insist maids should follow their order instead of the 'owner order'.
5506,Many on this thread seem to think that Malay and Indian sensitivity to racism is the bigger problem versus actual racism.
5507,"Yet when we actually look at what is happening in this country, racism is clearly still the bigger problem."
5508,I empathise with them because I experience racism here in Singapore as a minority and I can only imagine how much worse it is for them over there.
5509,I also have family and friends in the US who aren't white and have been at the receiving end of racist stereotyping and racial profiling as well.
5510,I can understand how there are those who are supporting BLM and turn a blind eye to the racism in Singapore but we can use this as an opportunity to teach them.
5511,"These losers on reddit/Facebook/YouTube can’t bare to see the community they look down on hold high-paying jobs in what they deem to be their (Chinese) country, and hence, the barrage of vitriolic and racist comments."
5512,They’ll never admit to their xenophobia or racism tho.
5513,"Agree, but unfortunately (as the down votes show) many will rather pin it on racism than face the truth about their fear of the Covid-19 virus."
5514,"My point is that if he was really racist, he would have implemented policies to ensure Chinese hegemony in Singapore, and we would have ended up a society similar to HK or Taiwan in terms of racial makeup."
5515,"And then of course, the recent state of racist attacks just further highlight the issue."
5516,The emails they send out with advice about maids and covid are so insulting.
5517,Like the maids are children or pets.
5518,We will never have a domestic worker.
5519,"While I think most people who have studied abroad do recognise that racism can get very bad (usually the type that threatens your physical safety), I have sg friends of the same ethnicity studying in the same uni saying that it's not worse abroad, which makes me skeptical."
5520,But now people are insinuating that PA are obviously racist and done it on purpose(???
5521,The way we treat our foreign workers are just alike the way White Americans treated their slaves.
5522,"If there would be a VTL, your vaccination in Thailand would be accepted."
5523,"Agreed, and I'd say *in general* maids employed by the Aussies Kiwis and Brits are treated better."
5524,"Perhaps because we are not used to the sort of conditions seen as normal for maids, and it makes us uncomfortable."
5525,"Agreed, it is racism; in this case a kind of passive-aggressive 'retaliation' for perceived injustices."
5526,"Agreed, subconcious racism or racial indifference might be a better word to decribe the incident."
5527,"If you stay silent, you are allowing the racist behaviour to continue unchecked."
5528,I was worried when someone said the following and don't think it's racist.
5529,At this stage maid felt like legal slavery.
5530,HK and Singapore are the only countries/places in Asia heavily reliant on FDW.
5531,"And I think Singapore has even more FDWs than HK, despite HK being a larger place, with a higher population and a more established role as global financial center."
5532,"Countries like Taiwan, Korea and Japan don't even allow FDWs at all."
5533,"At the same time this CECA theory is just a rabbit hole, a useless narrative born out of blind frustration that will get you nowhere."
5534,"I don't think it is racism or classism, it is more like is this customer can fuck me up ?"
5535,"Coupled with the self-imposed narrative of xenophobia, inferring that the G is blaming the citizens every time a new measure is announced, it’s definitely easy for people to get real angsty this time"
5536,"I really hate this sub sometimes but it's really a true reflection of society to see people calling out racism as minorities being too ""sensitive""."
5537,I see a lot of deflection of the blame on the operators and employers of the foreign workers.
5538,There are so many countries in APAC that could definitely serve as better places than to be burdened by the anti expat views here
5539,"I think the discrepancy arises because expats tend to be rich, intelligent and of high social status (or they wouldn't be expats), and all those traits are correlated with height."
5540,This selection bias ensures that expats anywhere seem tall compared to the average local.
5541,"If this keeps up until next year, there will be a mass exodus of expats."
5542,A few hotheads online do not constitute a wave of xenophobia.
5543,Reverse racism is still racism.
5544,"The VTL, while groundbreaking in 2021, is largely becoming an anachronism as other countries open up wholly to vaccinated travelers without quarantine."
5545,This thread is a sad reflection of how racist Singapore is.
5546,"Why can't people understand that you can oppose government immigration policy at the policy level, while at the same time treating all fellow humans with basic decency and respect?"
5547,Ah I'm always torn when my wife and I argue about maid treatment.
5548,I'm not at all close with the maid but I also don't treat her like a stranger in the house.
5549,"I don't know man, its not like I can pull off moral highground when I can't deny how much help a maid is for having peace of mind when my work is built upon irregular hours."
5550,"Also deafening silence when expat bully local chinese but flying-kick incident at Marsiling, indian vs indian incident at Pasir Ris and NP lecturer incident suddenly transform into a roaring lion/chest-beating gorilla."
5551,"And in Shan’s words, racism."
5552,"By using this logic at face value, you can literally call every single racial affirmative action programmes in the world racist since they are aimed at helping one racial group aka preferring one racial group over another."
5553,"But if behind the exclusion of a certain race, your mentality is that most/all people of that certain race will definitely exhibit a particular behaviour, then that is surely a racist notion, which means your subsequent action to exclude them is racist as well."
5554,Ah but ‘don’t spoil market’ like The maid agents would say…
5555,Ah cue the CECA-related comments everywhere like ST comments section.
5556,Singapore treats migrant workers terribly.
5557,"Whether it's calling someone bangla, hitting the Indonesian maid or transporting workers - it all have roots in racism."
5558,"I have high respect for Singapore in many aspects and see it as a model state in many ways, but when it comes to migrant workers there is a long way to go for ethical treatment."
5559,Ah gong was racist.
5560,"If their intention is to help expats ""make sense of ‘Singlish’"" and the piece of paper is a holistic representative of the course, then I believe they're missing the mark."
5561,Ah so all they should do is let them know that the maid isn't with them anymore?
5562,I’ve heard this from every racist person in my life.
5563,"Personally I’ve seen while driving down LCK road late at night at least 1 migrant worker in a lorry driving clearly drunk, weaving left and right across multiple lanes."
5564,Ah yes and that’s why we should just ignore it and get the locals to hunker down while screaming how racist and xenophobic they are amirite?
5565,"Pretty fucking ironic you keep assuming that's how it is, closet racist much fucktard?"
5566,"Saying that this discussion xenophobic and segregationist is frankly lazy, and a pathetic attempt to be ""woke""."
5567,Are there no expats who are staying?
5568,"[A Singaporean employee must earn at least S$1,300 before they can be counted towards a company’s foreign worker quota entitlement."
5569,"Ah yes, using Nationalism and a guise for xenophobia and racism."
5570,Sounds about par the course for racists.
5571,"Ah yes,because they're racist only if they put it in such explicit words."
5572,"I hope they put the dorms next to his house then,since he's not racist."
5573,I also jin fan jian and want my VTL holiday too.
5574,Racism and xenophobia.
5575,I can totally relate to failing mother tongue.
5576,Oddly enough I think being bullied and having racist remarks made about my Indian heritage helped pushed me closer to the Indian side.
5577,"singapore and being racist, a match made in heaven"
5578,"You just have to disable the ""hide racism and xenophobia as economic and immigration policy criticism"" filter."
5579,A lot of them reached here without even knowing they are supposed to work as maid.
5580,"Ah, so your point is that you've been equally racist to others in the past so I shouldn't point it out when it's directed at Indians."
5581,"I was actually looking for some migrant worker charities to donate to, and I’ll give the ones you recommended a look."
5582,In xenophobia against arrivistes from another motherland.
5583,But thats where the boxer dude is so comically racist it is fake.
5584,The sergeant was so racist he does not realise he is one.
5585,"""I am not racist."""
5586,My opinion is that nowadays racism is quite negligible for most people.
5587,But Saudi Arabia and Qatar is notorious for mistreating their maids.
5588,Literally treating maids from SEA like lower-class servants in the medieval times.
5589,Ahahaha uh not sure if you read the news but they just removed the need for VTL flights...  https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-vtl-pm-border-relaxation-1853296
5590,"Companies struggle a lot finding foreign talent, it expensive and takes a lot of time, you're just adding an extra useless step that will impact productivity."
5591,The magic of classifying data... Just like classifying migrant workers under dorm cases during 2020
5592,We're a nation of immigrants but apparently only one group is not loyal.
5593,They are in a far worse state than FDW.
5594,"I see many yelling at foreign workers stealing their jobs, but no Singaporeans apply."
5595,This totally means I can go there and come back with VTL before the 10th hahaha.
5596,"Now, even in countries with a good history of political unrest, it would be difficult to change the conditions of the migrant workers."
5597,"Or notice the differences in the youths and how we aren't trying to be traumatic like our parents by being judgemental, gossipy, inducing literal racism into our minds when we were growing up?"
5598,Next up - Space VTL.
5599,Aiya at first I thought there was a subreddit that we could see people bash CECA Indians and their ilk
5600,"Aiya forget about it, there are too many closet racists reciting the pledge."
5601,"Like the people in the video, No need to account for their actions, they think can be however racist they want because they wear a mask."
5602,"Those racists in the video, if they are asked to take off the mask and speak to a crowd, i bet they will say what everybody thinks is acceptable, maybe the masked racist guy would even commend the interracial relationship."
5603,"Even right here on reddit, a hundred comments talking about how racism is bad and bla bla for that sweet karma, I bet, down to my very last cent,  that there are at least a few closet racists in here."
5604,"When the whole pandemic gets better and everyone no longer needs to wear a masks, i'm sure these closet racists have no more room to display their racism in the public."
5605,Is that also racism lol
5606,"Needs more thinking about what being Singaporean is - we're essentially built as an immigrant city, constantly in flux."
5607,">	These latter companies might probably think that there is value in courting consumers who identify with being Islamophobic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, fatphobic, etc."
5608,Seems that ppl from other countries are more concerned about our poor migrant workers' welfare than our own govt.
5609,P/S: More about the truth about the problems faced by migrant workers in Singapore and how our govt chooses to ignore them: https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=lien_reports  https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/30/singapore-migrant-workers-covid-curbs https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211113-like-prison-singapore-migrant-workers-suffer-under-covid-curbs
5610,"I have friends who had bad experiences living in Australia and came back as they claim ""racism""."
5611,"Like it may not be as convenient as Singapore for groceries and eating out , not easy to find domestic helper etc."
5612,Those saying racism clearly do not know what they are talking about.
5613,"The victims have all the right to be angry, but should be for copyright instead of racism."
5614,If she continued to ride the whole racism thing publicly (as claimed by PA) and refuse to settle privately is definitely stepping out of line.
5615,All I'm saying is that all racism is bad and should be treated as such.
5616,So he cannot stake claim as a victim of racism in Singapore (or anywhere).
5617,The fact that you  mentioned this immediately grants white people as victims of racism in Singapore.
5618,"&#x200B;  >when you consider everyone of all nationalities as equal members of a community) is an enabling factor for racism,   >   >You don’t have to treat someone differently to acknowledge and respect that they have different values, cultures, and *experiences*."
5619,"OP mentioned racism towards migrant workers, (in case you misinterpret, I DO believe this is terrible) someone shared their personal racist experience (granted it is not a life and death severity) and he got attacked and disregarded because of the colour of his skin."
5620,"If we want to get rid of racism, we need to stop it at all levels and not just the severe ones, because guess how those severe ones started out as?"
5621,"All Qantas flights into and through Singapore are designated VTL flights as well, but those are running *way* below the normal capacity - SIN-SYD only has one weekly service on Friday evenings, for example, whereas it looks like SIA is running daily flights between here and Sydney."
5622,All VTLs
5623,Remember what you all insist when people brought this up previously as an example of discrimination to debunk your point that we treat maids well?
5624,Remember many of you also don't see a problem with keeping maids' passports and not letting them use phone?
5625,"In fact, China and India don't even accept immigrants."
5626,"All eyes on THE RESTART OF S'pore's reopening progress and VTL RESTART for 2022 economic outlook  Ftfy, 160th."
5627,"Middle income families in the future shouldn't bet on getting a maid, but rather, we should be looking into permanent Work From Home arrangements for mothers and whatnot."
5628,"The vaccine thing was just pure populism, there was NO reasonable argument for it besides xenophobia and populism, and it was actively against the interests of public health."
5629,All our leaders have treated migrant workers like raw materials.
5630,All races can enter SAP schools provided they take Chinese as their mother tongue language subject.
5631,All racists and xenophobes should go back to their own country
5632,"Like all races should not name-call other races, talking in own language or loudly when others are around, not charge other races higher prices when others order food  and hire management people just based on race (meritocracy argument is BS, when the top is trying hard to defend his racist hiring)."
5633,"If these uncomfortable truths result in you treating people like they are less than you, then yes it's racist and a problem."
5634,"And the biggest issue with racism (as opposed to other types of discrimination, say classism) is that you can tell straightaway."
5635,All the VTLs are politically motivated.
5636,All the foreign talents of course.
5637,All the headline is saying is that our 2022 economical outlook is dependent on how our VTL and reopening progresses.
5638,"If we reopen more and expand our VTLs, economical outlook would be good."
5639,"Also, PR and Singaporeans do have some freedom, like can get married during covid for example, while expats cannot."
5640,"If you were good in the first place (in numbers), no firm is even going to bring in expats."
5641,"After that automatically, you would not be competing with an expat."
5642,All these ____ (insert race) keep fucking it up = calling out racism?
5643,All these feel good jerking about poor treatment of the migrant workers yet very few people actually think about realistically how can we improve their conditions.
5644,All true but let's not pretend there aren't Singaporeans who are channeling their xenophobia under the pretext of taking action to safeguard the vulnerable from the coronavirus epidemic.
5645,All you said is so racist especially the food bit.
5646,Checked the VTL guides.
5647,Don't mistreat maid but let's hold our pitchforks till the other side give their side of the story.
5648,Almost everything and anything is xenophobic in the 21st century ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
5649,While you can just start air travel VTLs almost instantaneously since all the infrastructure are already in place.
5650,"Yes, the US has problems with xenophobia, but in the major cosmopolitan cities, that xenophobia is nowhere nearly as pronounced."
5651,"And yes, clearly there is a growing issue of xenophobia in Singapore, as well."
5652,"The arguments against immigrants and FTs in Singapore is *exactly the same* as the far-right, anti-immigrants, even terrorists in the US and other countries."
5653,"Already, similar protests have been spreading throughout the US, Western Europe, and even Japan (where the issue is apparently their police's ill treatment of a Kurdish immigrant)."
5654,"Alright, let me spell out the link for you then: you're being racist (even if you claim otherwise) by making assumptions of a person's race/nationality based on physical features."
5655,** The person who said that Singapore is built on the backs of migrant workers could not have said it more aptly.
5656,"The moment we stop the flow of these migrant workers or implement a dormitory lockdown, you can hear the gears that keep Singapore going grinding to a halt."
5657,There's no predicting what's the next crisis that may completely shut off our supply of cheap migrant workers.
5658,I think domestic workers are mostly not treated fairly.
5659,Are you an owner of a company in Construction sector and do you have any FDW working under your company?
5660,&#x200B;  I am guessing that that link might be for the FDW in Construction Sector who was issued SHN starting today.
5661,"I don't get why evil and Nazi is being brought up, he should really address Piang Ngaih Don  by her name instead of constantly calling her foreign domestic worker as her name was already released."
5662,Also sad that some kids are more attached to the maid than to their parents.
5663,"So, if you’re in HK Macau or the PRC and want to visit any of the countries on Singapore’s VTL list you can come to Singapore, not have to quarantine, work in the same time zone for two weeks (and probably from your company’s Singapore office if your employer is a MNC), then go wherever you need within Singapore’s VTLs, all without having to quarantine on your return to Singapore, using it effectively as a hub for travel to Europe and, increasingly, Asia."
5664,Also the people at those larger expat Singapore forum tend to be pretty negative (they call it being realistic).
5665,Do Indians find it racist?
5666,Also there's no way the maid looked fine after going through all of that.
5667,"Singaporeans tend to be less social at the workplace, compared to expats who might be more laid back, plus they might be new to the environment so they wanna make some friends"
5668,"Also, [47 per cent of migrant workers in S'pore dorms have had a Covid-19 infection](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/47-per-cent-of-migrant-workers-in-dorms-have-had-a-covid-19-infection-say-manpower-and)."
5669,"Edit: Hope I’m not in breach of any Sg reddiquette but there is a fundraising for the acquitted helper, Parti, set up by HOME (the organisation that helped her and many other migrant workers) at giving.sg - no contribution is too small!"
5670,Many work permit holders pay employment agents back home thousands of dollars to secure a job in Singapore.
5671,Rise in boarding business as more parents elect to leave their kids behind while they holiday on VTL.
5672,**TL;DR Yes Singapore is more openly racist than you seem to be used to.
5673,A travel ban is at this time not considered xenophobic to me.
5674,Direct personal insults based on race would be considered xenophobic to me.
5675,"Yes, from an economic standpoint and inflow of foreign talent would benefit the country, but have you considered the micro-perspective?"
5676,"Although it's illegal, I can't help but have some sympathy for them when the pay for being a domestic worker is so pathetic."
5677,"Although there may be real cases of mistreatment in Singapore and i sympathise with those maids, i dont think there is enough information here to conclude that her employers were mistreating her."
5678,"If the family catered dinner for 4 and ate separately while leaving the 4th portion for the maid, also considered poor diet and mistreatment?"
5679,"Although, if we don't have the social nets to provide our current foreign workers with proper accommodation, food, healthcare or protection from employer exploitation, should we be bringing in more foreign workers?"
5680,"Although, to be fair, the foreign workers levies that are paid, are kind of a very hefty tax on foreign workers."
5681,"A maid is someone's daughter, sister,  or mother."
5682,"Always been drifting anyway, lots of expats leave and new ones replace them."
5683,">   >.. and then what happened was the employers started thinking - hey you know my workers are living in the same dormitory, maybe you should bring them for testing."
5684,Am Chinese  Apparently anything I say that upsets a non Chinese in Singapore makes me racist as fuck
5685,The article title implies he thinks Singapore isn't a good place for expats and then goes on to make a short list of some good things about Singapore.
5686,Am I racist if I have a preference on which race to marry?
5687,Am I still a migrant worker if PR?
5688,"In either case, happy to shed the pretentious “expat” label."
5689,"Am I the only one who feels like theres something rotten and systemically fucked up about the way we employ maids, that's causing this to keep happening?"
5690,"Physical assault and murder are already very serious offenses under the law that carries the death penalty, so why is that this shit keeps happening to maids?"
5691,"You don't hear about other low wage workers like cleaners being severely abused very often, but maid cases appear here like every month."
5692,"I think it might be time for an actual ban, or at least extremely strict restrictions for hiring maids."
5693,Am I the only one who thought it was decently noble of Singapore to allow migrant workers to not only stay in the island during a pandemic - but to see to their medical needs and consistent testing?
5694,This can't be what the general population of migrant workers wants to happen to them every time trouble rears its head here!
5695,"lmao  Also, you're conflating racist with xenophobia."
5696,"Or you pulling the wumao ""don't be racist toward China"" card?"
5697,"Took Malay as my mother tongue, can't speak Tamil unfortunately as my family didn't use it much."
5698,"Am Singaporean Indian Muslim, but because my mother tongue is Malay, most Chinese friends would assume I'm Malay."
5699,"But that's not the racism bit, I don't fault them as it is pretty confusing haha."
5700,"The racism bit happened during a discussion about A Level History (we were going through Inter State Tensions, and we were discussing about the comments made by then General Lee Hsien Loong  that there was a deliberate lack of Malays in the SAF due to concerns of them choosing between Nation or Religion/Race)."
5701,"I would not call it deliberate racism on her part but because of the notion she has or was brought up with, it led her to question my loyalty."
5702,"Here in MY, we learn malay, english and optional mother tongue."
5703,"Am all for greater freedom of movement for migrant workers, but this comparison doesn't make sense."
5704,Am always nice to the maid because I am the maid
5705,"Am an average swe, and selling insurance on the side lol, I do want to make a career in tech, and not just in management, but I really have the confidence especially with ageism and younger fresh grads or foreign talents coming in, so will need many backup plans."
5706,"Am expat, can confirm."
5707,"I'm not saying there are no racists, but should our tolerant Chinese friends bear the burden of eliminating racism simply because of their racial association to a handful of bad actors?"
5708,"Am sure if maids are not mandated by law to live-in, a fair number of families would be fine with having their helpers come and go with fixed hours."
5709,Singaporeans are so privileged that they think the lives of FWs/FDW are the same as Singaporeans.
5710,Amazing we dun have more maids killing the owners in their sleep
5711,"Those people who ""manage maids"" are the kind of person you don't want your child to come to contact with."
5712,"The only thing the gahmen did was to setup the MWC (which is like the migrant worker's version of a union, only lesser) instead of choosing to work with HOME or TWC which had a real handle on the issues that migrant workers faced in Singapore."
5713,"Why can't I have a racial preference without being ""insecure"" or racist myself?"
5714,"My grandmother had a black maid, in the South, but there was definitely more personal distance and a level of *gentility* despite the obvious class divide and institutionalized racism."
5715,I can't recall anyone having live-in maids.
5716,"It's hard for Americans to imagine having live-in maids, or wanting someone in your home 24/7."
5717,American expat with 3 kids here.
5718,Most white folks are still planted in the suburbs...where they increasingly encounter a burgeoning population of latinos and immigrants anyway.
5719,TBH all big expat packages are a thing of the past but you'll do just fine on that wage.
5720,"Amongst the complains that we often hear either from locals, expats or tourists about Singapore, I’m curious to hear the other side of why people love and eventually choose to settle here."
5721,I am ALL FOR foreign talent.
5722,I would propose employment passes tied to performance and/or ability to jump company.
5723,But note H1B1 is a non-immigrant visa.
5724,"An aunty just ranted to me about how she had to have a maid to take care of her mum who is suffering from dementia, and how different maids will take care of her mum as maids might have their off day or her other siblings bring the mum out."
5725,"I'm like, so you cannot take care of your mum for that one day that the maid is not around?"
5726,"The comments on here do bring out good points, but like not everybody can just be independent after being reliant on a maid during their formative years and it really depends on the situation."
5727,An easy choice for Australian expatriates: Our country won't let us go home basically.
5728,An employment pass is a work pass.
5729,"And while there is apparently also a new lane for work permit holders to enter from Indonesia and the Philippines, this article clearly refers to 8 very much developed countries as the “higher risk countries”"
5730,See how the salaries for domestic worker went up once there was a disruption to the flights and permits.
5731,The vacancy rate in the private rental market is rising because of the reduction in employment passes and we can make use of this temporary increase in housing availability to house young couples.
5732,There was already a foreign worker in the lift.
5733,"Oh well...  To the foreign workers who toil so much for our buildings and renovation, thank you."
5734,An lah Chinese all racist la hor BRB I go identify as helicopter OK bo?
5735,An observation is that the conditions for a VTL seems to be a combination of geo-political/macro-economic and COVID situational factors.
5736,"That the PAP will continue to maintain budget and other forms of discipline even in a context where voters do not care about the quality of opposition candidates and are sending to Parliament candidates pushing profligate and/or xenophobic policies (because hey, policies and candidates don't matter)."
5737,"Because the message the electorate sends the PAP must not be that voters will reward short term, profligate or xenophobic policies."
5738,And I doubt it was because they chose to start transporting workers around in tour buses.
5739,And I find it a little weird that people are so quick to find excuses for those who make xenophobic comments.
5740,"If someone makes a xenophobic comment, then it's natural to think they're xenophobic."
5741,"And I would argue that context matters, and 4 is totally relevant to 3 which makes it not racist."
5742,Does that make Mahathir racist against his own race?
5743,And I'm happy to be proven wrong if she can adduce further evidence of racism against non-Chinese.
5744,"It's not that racism doesn't exist in Singapore, it exists."
5745,"Add the feelgood, xenophobic narrative that Indian outsources are terrible therefore the all talent must be terrible and a complete lack of introspection and uncle and aunty are postulating that Mohinder is stealing Desmond's job."
5746,"The problem of black people being murdered unfairly has been a problem since the beginning of time and its far greater than any form of racism we face here, and i am a minority here."
5747,And Singapore makes it so hard for expats to get citizenship with a totally arbitrary seeming process that offers no feedback.
5748,"And VTL tix is $603 per pax, no thank you"
5749,Source: I had FDWs last time.
5750,"Unfair, because a Singaporean can never be able to survive on a foreign worker's wages, and a Singaporean is living in very different circumstances from a foreign worker's."
5751,And bar her from being able to hire a maid ever again.
5752,"And body shaming people that disagree with you makes you mature by any chance?To me, this is another way to prove how narrow minded and childish someone can be, but probably you are in high school, thinking I will get triggered by you using the pp syndrome thingy 🙄  Actually your envy for expats (pretty clear here) and the fact that you went all the way to check my other threads is flattering ♥️"
5753,"AFAIK, most FDW are hired by parents to look after their kids, this seems like a good idea no?"
5754,And expats can complain about Singaporeans and heap praises on the infrastructure in SG.
5755,"And for Redditors who always argue that Singaporeans only hate the foreign talents, not foreign workers, the guy being discriminated in the video is most likely a foreign worker."
5756,"Also, go to EDMW and motherhood to see Singaporeans' attitude towards Indian nurses and maids."
5757,"> Back to the debate, if this is a chinese new year event and an events company goes and grabs a chinese couple's wedding picture, then cut out the face and the wedding couple finds out goes to instagram all is calling out for racism and ignorance, cause they cannot tell the difference between outfits."
5758,"Personally be angry about PDPA, Copyrights etc.. but will I call this out as ignorance and racism?!?"
5759,"I mean, I have no reservations about telling racists off but I gotta think of the consequences too."
5760,And give them a life time ban on hiring domestic helpers.
5761,"These people will return to their own lives, their own work, their own studies, as if they had never posted racist comments like these."
5762,"But absolutely nothing will happen to them, nor will they ever be called to account for their racist comments."
5763,Not sure if he's implying OP is a construction worker with a maid gf.
5764,And her and her family she never be allowed to hire a domestic worker ever again.
5765,Xenophobia and racism was not so apparent until the late 2000s (Pretty much 2008 to 2010) when policy changes resulted in massive demographic shifts.
5766,And in doing so you ultimately lose/don't attract the better foreign talent.
5767,"And in other news, ""Man gets jail for ordering more than S$700 worth of food from GrabFood and Foodpanda without paying""  So, cheating a company out of $700 is way worse than illegally confining foreign workers for 40-odd days 3x4m room is definitely way."
5768,"You'll notice many post their racist, sexist, homophobic, or downright stupid comments and never reply to people calling them out on their shit."
5769,"And just to clarify, the maid had never inform my aunt that she is unhappy working there, or if she wants to leave, change employers etc."
5770,"If she was informed, my aunt would have contacted the agent to send her back to the agent for the agent to try to arrange new employment for her and for my aunt to get a new maid."
5771,"If a maid is not willing to work at her home, she will allow the maid to leave and not force the maid to continue, as an unwilling maid might pose risks for her kid."
5772,"And many people still claim that this country is “bEtTer tHaN cOuNtRiEs LiKe tHe US” when it comes to being anti racist LMAO.As a resident since birth,I’m glad that I have never bought into the propaganda and have always followed common sense"
5773,Even Arabs in Singapore will be assume as Malay by most Singaporeans because most Arabs in Singapore take up Malay as mother tongue in school instead of Arabic.
5774,And not to mention racism is mostly an accumulation of biased thoughts from the people around them.
5775,"(May not be true anymore since parents tend to foist their childcare off to maids nowadays, but that creates a whole new problem)"
5776,"And on the flip side, you have scams where women accuse expats of molestation at clubs to extort money from them."
5777,"And one stat that I do have offhand is that the US approves about 65000 H-1Bs per year, which is how many FDWs are in Singapore."
5778,"Separately, we know that top local graduates who excel at MNCs can become expats, but are the expats who come here top foreign grads who have excelled in their previous roles?"
5779,The larger question is allowing migrant workers back into the community.
5780,Why are they banking on a strict legal definition of racism to decide for everyone else what’s racist enough and what’s not?
5781,And pointing an accusing finger at people who were ignorant rather than racist helps?
5782,"It just pushes the ignorant people to be racist, adding to the problem."
5783,Which is racist
5784,I am planning a return to SG in a month time and one way on SQ has gone up 30% at least since the last time I checked before this VTL thing.
5785,And some maids lose it and resort to violence.
5786,"But so far I have not seen any comment here that says things like ""Chinese cannot experience racism"" or people supporting the racist incident?"
5787,Do you think those Middle Eastern countries care if you are racists to other ethnicity and culture while there as long as you respect theirs?
5788,"I can't imagine the outcry if the government comes out and says ""we are increasing income tax by 1% or 2% across the board because you guys said you wanted all foreign workers to be bussed around instead of being in lorries and due to the increase in bidding costs we need to make up for the short fall."""
5789,"I'm not arguing that foreign workers don't deserve better, but someone has to foot their costs of increasing those standards, somehow I don't think the majority of Singaporeans are willing to foot those costs."
5790,And that guy has to bring up CECA again even after its been explained to death and even LotO don't see much wrong with it other than the govt should have released some of those data sooner
5791,"And that's why, depute it being tough, my family refuses to hire a maid to take care of my disabled father."
5792,"In singapore, we let the foreign workers do it at a paltry amount."
5793,It's not racist to say Singapore is not ready for a non Chinese PM.
5794,"Before, during times of relatively low cases, VTLs are used to gatekeep imported cases from reaching our shores."
5795,"However, ever since early Jan where we had uncontrolled and undetected community transmission of Omicron, there is no use for VTLs anymore."
5796,VTLs are useful only when cases are low.
5797,"However when community transmission is rampant, VTLs dont do anything anymore."
5798,"If she's breaking the law by abusing the maid, who suffers?"
5799,I strongly believe it is the children's duty to ensure that the grandmother treats the maid properly.
5800,"This is an issue of education, not lack of laws on how to treat a maid."
5801,And the problem of migrant workers being treated as there are now probably isn't going to change anytime soon.
5802,And then auntie scolds foreign worker for taking up reserved seat.
5803,And then there are tons of cry baby sinkie maid hirers who cannot flip a pan without a hired help.
5804,I heard there are no non-VTL reentries until mid-January.
5805,"If the govt doesn't give clarity by the end of Q2/Q3 on when they would allow people to return to SG, that might be the last straw for at least those expats."
5806,And this right here is racism.
5807,"And well if you want to be smug, you know I know that your points about this broad definition of xenophobia, as well as Burakumin, have all gone nowhere."
5808,And what did racism mean before?
5809,And what makes you think that some of our leaders are not racist themselves?
5810,"If they wanted to address about racism, they would've done so long time ago."
5811,And why is that racist????
5812,"I mean i too would prefer if no one sat next to me, but this isnt issue exclusive to foreign workers.. infact, it isnt an issue at all."
5813,If a country wants any level of assimilation it needs to accept immigrants.
5814,Don't even have to hire physically and pay foreign worker levies!
5815,And yet so many of their immigrants can't speak English either...
5816,"And yet the police continue to ignore calls my friend made on foreign workers gathering in close quarters having meals and drinks below his block, smh"
5817,"And yet there are also minorities who feel that this is an instance of racism, and who feel that the PA and the people defending its actions are out of touch!"
5818,"Insisting that I am saying you are racist, or that the PA is racist, is nothing but a strawman argument."
5819,I have also agreed that the PA is not explicitly racist in what they did.
5820,"I just find it curious that people are using cultural insensitivity and ignorance as a deflection, as though these 2 issues are somehow still better than direct racism itself, especially when it relates to an organisation dedicated to promoting racial harmony and cohesion."
5821,"If she was principled about racism, she could have just said ""Nah fam, I'm not interested"" and declined to represent Malaysia."
5822,"[https://indonesiaexpat.biz/featured/corona-patient-runs-away-from-persaha](https://indonesiaexpat.biz/featured/corona-patient-runs-away-from-persaha)  As I said before, Singaporeans should just stick to getting their news about Indonesia from Strait Times and CNA."
5823,And you enabled her and validated her opinion by accommodating her racism.
5824,Taking a one-size fits all approach to classifying racism in a society is equivalent to only judging a book by its cover.
5825,"* And when you complain about it, people will laugh that ""you kept quiet when others made racist jokes; now that the shoe's on the other foot, how does it fit?"""
5826,And you're not being racist?
5827,My current place mostly expats also and we always go out for lunch.
5828,Some expats don’t make an effort to integrate either.
5829,My girlfriend stays beside an Indian expat family.
5830,"Said Indian expat family also doesn’t seem to understand the concept of a double yellow line, they park in a single lane driveway beside the lift lobby instead of using the Multi-storey Carpark, RIGHT BESIDE the block."
5831,These kinda selfish actions doesn’t help with local-expat integration.
5832,"Local Indians also feel, that whatever good rep they built up, is being tarnished by the actions of FEW (not all) dumb expats."
5833,Does it mean that all expats commit such acts?
5834,"I hope to find someone who is able to say that their colleague could have been replaced by a Singaporean, since this is the narrative peddled by critics of the immigration policy (cited), which I am still waiting for."
5835,I doubt anyone using either term believes it’s racist - but I also guess it’s the person on the recieving end that gets to judge if they think the term is appropriate or not.
5836,"Ang moh ah... ya i see many of them taking all the good positions, get expat benefits some more."
5837,"Ang moh dua kee *“It’s just one of many ways in which Singapore showed it’s not super friendly to expats, and that they will always prioritise their own citizens ahead of foreigners,” the consultant, who wished to remain anonymous, said""*"
5838,Angry at lack of enforcement is not racism
5839,Another 1 dimension simpleton who views everything as racist.
5840,"I’ve been here 7 years and I’m very happy to stay and wait this out - there are so many places that are doing far worse…  I won’t deny it, living here as an expat during COVID definitely brought inconveniences."
5841,Another angle: Imagine being triggered enough to comment on the racism in Singapore when she's coming from a country where she's a minority
5842,Another day where a poor maid have their life ruined and the courts barely do any punishment.
5843,"Another day, another news story about maids being abused in ""first world"" Singapore."
5844,"Another day, another racist.."
5845,Another reason why you should not give the FDW to keep the work permit.
5846,If it's not possible to tell indians and bangladeshis apart by physical features you or the other poster could have just as simply said that it's not possible instead of accusing me of racism and trying to be condescending.
5847,"Another woke individual, no one called to close borders, everyone is asking for a temp border closure with countries of high risk, this happened last year with china as well."
5848,"If Singapore wants to keep their place in the technological world, facing giants like the EU (450m people), the US (330m people), China (1.4b), and India (1.3b), in that case, they have to attract and retain foreign talents and stop the rhetoric of Singaporeans vs Foreigners."
5849,"But I also think in any society, when the flood gates are suddenly opened and a large number of foreigners flood the country suddenly, there will be some form xenophobia."
5850,And there is also the matter of expat enclaves and the bubbles they live in that makes it difficult for them to understand what the average Singaporean goes through.
5851,"*For the record, I dislike the PRC but a lot of the rhetoric on the web is ignorant and xenophobic."
5852,"Any Singaporean topic on Facebook tends to attract at least one of these xenophobic or ""patriotic"" idiots for some reason."
5853,Any attempt from anyone to try and justify racist stereotypes will always be met with downvotes.
5854,The govt cannot and should not provide data for every single racist stereotype.
5855,"By even responding to it, the govt is acknowledging it and it would only embolden the racists."
5856,There are other ways to reduce and prevent racism if that was your intention.
5857,"Even if the racial stereotype was true in this case, what the govt should do is engage and prevent sexual assault crimes by migrant workers."
5858,They definitely should not do anything that may encourage racism towards migrant workers.
5859,Your comment is racist without some evidence or statistical data to back it up.
5860,"Any expat package for deployment in a First-World Country will be more than sufficient for anyone's life, including their family."
5861,Out of 5 mil I would say 250000 to each maid would be fair.
5862,Any fully vaxxed foreign worker should be given the same access as any fully vaxxed local.
5863,Any idea on  1. what kind of work permits that are non FDW & non construction?
5864,Any insights into why the consensus seems to be maid agency are scummy?
5865,"Any migrant worker here probably has embodied greater contributions to the country in a single pinky than you ever did in your entire lifetime, you whinging fecalclot."
5866,Be it taking secret photo racist making fun defaming or whatever that isn't properly spelled out by the law.
5867,"Any policy can be considered racist  For example some think that scholarships should be race-blind, because the alternative is a system where race takes precedence over individual merit, ie racism  Others think that race-blind meritocracy is racist because it results in unequal outcomes and exaverbates existing inequalities."
5868,"Not only does it limit discourse and the ability to call out bad ideas, some may even accuse you of being an actual racist"
5869,Actually they would all prefer locals since they won’t have to deal with work permit and keep their foreign workers quota lower.
5870,Ching chong is unmistakably a racist slur.
5871,"Backstory: I'm currently working in an organisation where it's majority Singaporeans, but was from a previous company where the office was majority expats (mostly from Australia, UK)."
5872,Anyone got comments on the agency fees paid since the new FDW rulings ?
5873,Anyone here who is an Singaporean Indian Muslim will tell you racism is real in SG and you’d by surprise at who the perpetuators are.
5874,Anyone over 50 I just assume they're racist unless proven otherwise.
5875,Anyone think VTL with Cambodia will open soon?
5876,Anyone who can and who cares about improving this issue for migrant workers should be writing to their MP at this point.
5877,Anyone who rationally wants to evaluate if CECA has had a net negative impact on Singapore citizens needs only to look at actual data pre-pandemic.
5878,Unemployment rate hovered between 2-3% (an exceptional rate for any country) despite CECA being put in place in 2005.
5879,Did CECA result in higher unemployment?
5880,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Unemployment-Summary-Table.aspx  Did CECA suppress wages?
5881,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Income-Summary-Table.aspx   Did CECA cause the poor to get poorer?
5882,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/IncomeTimeSeries.aspx   Did CECA cause underemployment?
5883,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Singapore-Citizens-in-the-Labour-Force.aspx (Chart 2 and 5)    Did CECA increase long-term unemployment or discourage workers?
5884,https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Singapore-Citizens-in-the-Labour-Force.aspx (Chart 12)  This data is publicly available and should be all that matters to determine if Singaporeans are structurally worse off since CECA was implemented.
5885,Anyone who takes advantage of VTL in the next month or so will be patting themselves on the back when we get locked down again.
5886,I just see a Chinese person.. this is how racism is taught to our youth.
5887,Anyone who was going to apply for H1B1 - what's your plan now that non-immigrant visa appointments are indefinitely cancelled?
5888,"That said, I don't think anyone can deny that prolonged confinement of migrant workers in dormitories where there are no known outbreaks (esp."
5889,I'm not interested in being a moron drunk expat.
5890,Anything that threatens the foundational principles of racism and hypocrisy on which the Party have run Singapore for 55 years **must be resisted!!!!1!
5891,"Anw the CMIO model has to go la, we are so much more diversified now."
5892,"One that really made me roll my eyes was how the poster tried to discredit your experiences with ""what about when we Chinese face racism from people like prettipls"""
5893,Anyway according to the law  The maid should be given a room.
5894,"If you have a maid ,see how you can improve her life."
5895,"Actually I have no idea if this is true or to what extent its true, I just keep hearing this rhetoric about the low salaries of maids, construction workers, and other transient workers."
5896,(Must be the kind of melayu that are quick to call out racism if we kena right?
5897,"The stats Coming with a wife and kid, wife will not work for now but may do some part time stuff when the kid starts school in a few years (public school if possible) Were not aiming for that 5 star expat lifestyle, HBD is fine, just to have an average life."
5898,They should not give in to xenophobic sentiment about closing borders.
5899,Apparently a lot of the foreign workers didn't come down with anything too bad as well.
5900,"Be it academic docs, salary/income docs, family infor (parents, siblings)  Processing time: Can be 9 months to 3 years (based on expatsingapore / sgcn sources)  Chances / Anecdotal evidence: Typically racial balance + financials + Tenure/commitment to SG + Some invisible hand :)   i.e."
5901,"And it is extremely difficult, almost impossible to get PR nowadays for indian( CMIO racial quota)"
5902,"Oh wait, distinguished, neighbours are not maids, have human rights"
5903,I simply state that Woke/anti-woke culture is not devoid of racism.
5904,If your company doesn't offer you better living conditions overseas than back at home then what for go be expat.
5905,Are SAP schools like grammar schools in the UK (just with extra emphasis on mother tongue)?
5906,Are expat groups being treated worse than locals at the moment?
5907,Are expats by default foreign talents?
5908,Are maids able to take care of the elderly?
5909,Are people really saying the problem is because of the number of foreign workers or did they just made it up to conflate it with the housing prices?
5910,"The root cause of the problem is really the living condition, reducing the number of foreign worker does nothing if they don't improve the living conditions."
5911,"As kids we get punished for bullying other races and made to do projects with them, that's how it's seared into our brain that racism in the workplace is wrong."
5912,SAP school kids are taught not to be racist in theory but lack practical experience because SAP schools exclude other races and kids don't experience what racism is like in reality.
5913,"My experience is that I'm much more willing to call out racism than my SAP school peers, because in my schools Malays/Indians/Eurasians/Chinese students will protest if they hear a racist jibe and I am conditioned to be more considerate to non-Chinese."
5914,"We can't get there yet, what hopes do you think the foreign workers will get there?"
5915,"Are the people who do these jobs ""foreign talent""?"
5916,Are the processes involved in the hiring of a maid and the agencies that facilitate this murky and sketch?
5917,Do some FDWs get sent here against their will because of their family situation?
5918,Do some employers criminally abuse their FDWs?
5919,Do FDWs find coming to Singapore better than going to Hong Kong or Dubai?
5920,Are many of our care sectors critically dependant on FDWs?
5921,"If the sentiments are based on bullshit information, do they still deserve mass upvotes and attention, to be given the chance to further perpetuate the underlying xenophobia and radicalise people who would otherwise be on the fence?"
5922,"Or all the CECA comments when the Ramesh guy bullied the security guard, when that guy is actually a naturalised Singapore citizen that obtained citizenship through marriage (which has absolutely nothing to do with CECA)."
5923,"If immigration and CECA are causing unemployment and PMETs to drive grab, this should be reflected in unemployment data and wages at the very least."
5924,"If all that the extremists have are ""sentiments"" based on conspiracies about our government falsifying data, and those people aren't open to any arguments to the contrary, then no, those people don't deserve our attention and don't deserve a space to progagate baseless xenophobia."
5925,Are there any reparations towards the two maids they abused?
5926,Video call to domestic worker every week/month would be helpful I think.
5927,"Also, don't employers have the responsibility to inform the maids about the cameras?"
5928,Thought I addressed your point by showing the difference between stereotype and racism.
5929,Are they racist to group maids with foreign workers or am I racist to think they are grouping maids with foreign workers.
5930,Are u a racist if you love that race ure marrying?
5931,Are u sure your friend has come with expat package ?
5932,ANYTHING LESS THAN 14K a month is not expat
5933,Man barks at maid to move instead of asking nicely.
5934,If all Singapore's maid employers treated their maids like they'd want to be treated themselves then a large part of the problem this post brings up would vanish with no further action required.
5935,If you’re not then why are you giving shock pikachu face when you ask Asians who don’t use curry in a derogatory manner about whether using this word is racist?
5936,:/ I lived in the US (NYC and Oregon) for about a year and once had three (minor) racist incidents in a single day.
5937,"If you are coming from overseas for leisure, you have to travel via VTL."
5938,Non-VTL does not allow short-term visits.
5939,Are you a domestic helper?
5940,Check out [Racism and the Pinkerton syndrome in Singapore: effects of race on hiring decisions ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-pacific-rim-psychology/article/racism-and-the-pinkerton-syndrome-in-singapore-effects-of-race-on-hiring-decisions/5924D22CCF6F71558B5DE9002CDBA12F/core-reader).
5941,Us minorities face other forms of racism often too.
5942,Are you a work permit or employment pass holder?
5943,Are you able to fly there without using the VTL and come back with it?
5944,Because one of the criteria for VTL seems to be that the flights to take going out of SG has to be specific flights 🤔
5945,Are you an expat or a citizen?
5946,Are you asking me or an expat?
5947,The controversy being addressed in the OP is regarding what one actor considered racist requests in an audition for a very much mainstream and government-supported movie series.
5948,How did you conclude that they’re racist when the acceptable rates for non asean are lower compared to those who came from one of the asean countries?
5949,How is defending racism bad?
5950,"OP took a situation from MALAYSIA, put it into Singapore context and have excuses for racist hiring practices."
5951,Are you doing the VTL via a dedicated flight or gonna do the 7 days SHN at home?
5952,Did I say I only want to see Chinese race people being imported in as foreign talent?
5953,The other Indian national I was replying to was polite even though he shares with you the same warped view that India should be the only source of foreign talent for Singapore.
5954,Not to mention the new citizen angmohs/ex expats from all over who fall under the 'others' minority  category.
5955,The racist abuse to the football team by a minority is disgusting and rightly denounced by the vast majority of people.
5956,If I am racist I will act being fully aware so.
5957,Are you not taking into account of food and accommodation for these maids?
5958,Are you really trying to justify racism?
5959,Are you saying Indians cannot be racist?
5960,"Are you saying that you were not racist when you were living in a homogeneous environment, but when you are living with a multicultural city, you find yourself thinking racist thoughts?"
5961,Are you saying the Singapore government is racist?
5962,"If not, how is that showing the Jolibee as a racist company?"
5963,All I'm reading in your post is some pretty flagrant racism going in the other direction.
5964,Are you seriously using medical terms and scientific terms that are CLEAR AND WELL ESTABLISHED that everyone using them can easily understand without confusion as an example on why racism should have different undefined meaning where people can interpret freely based on their agendas?
5965,Nobody says you can't broaden what is racist.
5966,You want to brand everyone who makes a mistake that involves culture and race a racist?
5967,How in the world would that help the fight against racism?
5968,Nobody likes to be called a racist when they are not.
5969,This is how you undermine actual racism.
5970,How do you draw parallels between the probability of a meteorite striking your maid and the probability your maid with a boyfriend gets pregnant?
5971,"There are migrant workers who have been here for years, long after any debt would have been paid."
5972,"And I don't like that you're using the phrase racist to mean ""to be mindful of race"" because there's a very important distinction."
5973,Does switching languages make me racist?
5974,Am I racist if I prevent my dog from approaching people I think are Malay and Muslim without making sure they dislike dogs?
5975,"The maid I had growing up had her own room, with air con and TV inside."
5976,And maid gets one spacious room all to herself so she can have her rest and privacy away from us kids.
5977,All my relatives have maids and I find the treatment the same.
5978,One of my uncle's maid refuses to go home and basically adopted them as her family.
5979,"The real issue is, happy maids don't make the news."
5980,"A lot of xenophobic Singaporeans wouldn’t, that’s for sure."
5981,"If not, your argument obviously remain untrue and the *majority* of Chinese *Singaporeans* are descendants of Southern Chinese groups, whose mother tongue is not Mandarin."
5982,Aren't they already conducting investigations into the expats that were flouting the rules?
5983,"And in any case, my point was about the expats bidding."
5984,"https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/Forum201-special2.pdf  Edit: even if the source was crap, they still made a valid point in arguing that in a bidding system, only large companies will be able to get foreign talents as they would systematically win the bidding."
5985,You would end up with all the expats in large MNC and probably outnumbering locals while local companies could not get foreign talents even if they desperately needed them.
5986,"I'm just saying in general, not this foreign worker debate so pls don't downvote"
5987,"Arguably, it is the very treatment that many Singaporeans subject their domestic helpers to that may be tantamount to slavery."
5988,"Arguably, migrant workers can be considered our ""own"" population."
5989,"Arguably, the term maid does not have a negative connotation in most places."
5990,"Singapore is the place that looks down on the term ""maid"" and ""construction worker""."
5991,Singapore as a society constantly relies in the exploitation of foreign workers.
5992,"Article describes it well >The ebb and flow of foreign talent was driven by economic opportunities and a socially conducive living environment and if these were in place, “the brain drain would take care of itself”, he said."
5993,">Singapore and Hong Kong’s attractiveness for expats would be hard to replicate, Loh said, with one key factor being both cities’ use of English."
5994,As I said [before](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nx31qd/racial_preferences_cross_the_line_into_racism/h1e2lu4/):  >the object of a landlord is to maximise their profits by renting out their property.
5995,"As I said, I did not realize what was happening and I honestly I had not heard of CECA - this was about 5 years ago."
5996,Might it perchance be because you're trying to peddle a racist conspiracy?
5997,This CECA stuff you're talking about is all mostly nonsense.
5998,"I'm not saying there aren't issues with recruitment that SG people should have a problem with, but singling out Indians is just racist, sorry"
5999,They let their own racist sentiments get in the way.
6000,"As I’ve said before, I think most of us are not against foreign talent in Singapore."
6001,"We are not completely stupid to think that our borders should be closed and that every job should be filled by Singaporeans, no matter how much people want to try and portray Singaporeans (whether generally or specific communities like Reddit) as xenophobic."
6002,Do we scream xenophobia there?
6003,Why aren’t there articles slamming their xenophobia.
6004,Stories also abound about how quotas can be gotten around by upgrading these employees from S-pass holders to employment pass holders but salaries are withheld or rebated back to the company.
6005,Of course the Astro-turfing has begun now with recent articles by expatriates about how all these measures will be a serious problem for Singapore.
6006,"Anyway as OP mentions, my entire school phase was filled with racism from both teachers and students and also I was the only Indian student in class."
6007,I still see there are racism being rooted onto some younger generations because of their sick racist parents who still wants to be POS to the society.
6008,As a British expat I miss the weather the most.
6009,"As a Caucasian former expat in Singapore, wait until she tries to get her security deposit back from those scumbag landlords."
6010,As a Chinese I don't feel like I can say this because I feel people might think I might be racist when it's just a general observation I have more to say but nah not on Reddit
6011,"As a Chinese I have been the target of racist behavior in my workplace by my former employer, who was Indian."
6012,"As much as I feel what the lady who smashed the gong loudly did is wrong, it is upsetting to only see people calling out the majority for one person's act of racism."
6013,To be fair all races have their own racists don't you think?
6014,"What about those Chinese who have suffered racism from other minority races (in circumstances that they have made themselves the majority), like a workplace?"

6019,"There are folks in the majority race that are trying, its not easy but we are calling racism out as we see them."
6020,What about foreign workers from less developed countries?
6021,"As a Chinese in Singapore, I've yet encountered racism towards myself..."
6022,But I feel like slapping all the racist bastard out there.
6023,"It's 2018 already, why the fuck are there still racism...!"
6024,"As a Eurasian, I've definitely had my fair share of racism."
6025,As a European expat living in Singapore one of my big shocks moving here is how racist many people here are.
6026,It's a pretty normal when gathering with my expat friends to have a scandalised laugh at what's accepted here.
6027,"As a Filipino-American (not half, just an Americanised Filipino) who grew up in Singapore for 18 years, I’ve got to say sadly I’ve experienced more racism there than in the US."
6028,One could argue Singapore is more racist but the US’ is just more extreme.
6029,"Either way, racism is an issue most Singaporeans don’t realise is a huge one in SG and I really hope more people wake up to the fact SG isn’t as racially harmonised as they believe it to be, even amongst their own kind."
6030,"As a Malay, I agree that I got second hand embarrassment when the couple milked that racism card."
6031,"Out of all things that I'd agree to be racist (whether towards Malays/Indians/Chinese etc), this mainly seemed to be ignorance - albeit disappointing that the PA would stereotype our culture."

6033,It seems he has a racist undertone to his statements.

6038,As a Sri Lankan living here I always experience racism too..
6039,"As a brown expat, I don't think there's fear due to racism (say like an African American in the US), it's more that society doesn't seem to think the various races can or should mix."
6040,There's a very strict race hierarchy here and a lot of the racism and negativity flows on from that.
6041,I'm not trying to be racist here so stop being so sensitive.
6042,"His work with migrant workers - done before they were ""cool""-  is something that I will always be grateful for."

6051,"A number of cyclists will be errant, some immigrants will have dubious degrees and some western 'expats' will act like dicks."
6052,Or the one about the Indian expat verbally abusing the security guard?
6053,"The number of comments from those who are clearly males, stating that they are second class citizens that get upvoted just reinforce that mentality and encourage xenophobia without allowing for a nuanced discussion on the topic."
6054,"If you don't see it as racist, that's OK."
6055,"As a malaysian chinese that faced a lot of subtle and [not so subtle](https://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/chinese-bloodbath-flyers-old-scare-tactic-says-dap-lawmaker) racism back home trying to explain why all the jokes and switching to chinese in a group with indians/malay are not ""no big deal"", I have to say that for a lot of ppl that have never experienced racism, this is something that they can't conceptualize even if they tried to."
6056,"I suppose at this point you may ask if I am correct, how might an insult or genuine racism differ?"
6057,The answer is that it doesn’t in its immediate state but it may matter if genuine racism is perpetuated into things like poor treatment of minorities.
6058,"On that point, I agree with you that a lot of casual racism in Singapore may be detrimental."
6059,"As a minority in Singapore, the cases of outright racism here arent too frequent."
6060,"There might be some people who are outright racist, but very few."
6061,Older generation tend to be more “explicit” (hence that guy going into a more direct attack) but younger generation are racist in a subtle manner (e.g.
6062,"That’s why many of my Chinese friends are like: “Wah, overseas people are so racist!"
6063,Good thing Singapore no racism”.
6064,They don’t realize that racism/xenophobia usually affects the minority (or less powerful) class of person (which is why “no racism” in Singapore).
6065,"As a minority with an eye and ties with a country up north where i am the majority race, being a majority warps your mind so much that its a family joke that we malays are not racist only because we are not in power, that and being fed racial politics but that's the good thing about being here, you cant play that in Singapore."
6066,"Bet you if the dormitory cases didn't explode, even the slightest effort at giving them better conditions, assistance by the government will be met by derision and scorn by many Singaporeans, yes by even the minority ones that will say 'why locals never take care, always foreigners first' etc."
6067,"But to be honest, I'm not very hopeful that Politicians can give solutions or be conversation starters on Race & Religion, because they have yet to acknowledge and apologise for the kind of racism that our Singapore Politics has spewed in the past."
6068,"Thing is, if I’m being super sensitive and see every small thing as being racist, then it is, when in actual fact, it’s not."
6069,And there’s bigger problems than racism here.
6070,"As a minority, these are common examples of racism/racial stereotyping in Singapore that i've witnessed *no offence to anyone*:  Eh go back to China la  Chinese people never shower one so smelly  *Pinch* Singh what colour  South Indians/Tamils are dirty, smelly, poor  Malays got no education/ only know how to take drugs and get into trouble  Enough said."
6071,"As a mixed-race person myself with a mixed-race kid, personally I can't remember *ever* receiving racist remarks in public (though I occasionally get random people saying my kid is cute, or asking how old he is, etc.)"
6072,"For those who are giving indisputably racist remarks though, some jail time goes a long way to 杀一儆百."
6073,As a non-Malay and a sociologist I find you are a racist and ignorant bigot.
6074,"Suddenly, virus variants come from India, everyone start giving xenophobic remarks."
6075,"I really hope someone at least agrees with me, I have been thinking about certain xenophobic and racist remarks I often experienced in my education here."
6076,"As a side note, the numbers here are all residents, as we start phasing out vocations like retailers, construction workers, domestic helpers to WP/foreigners AND we start using these numbers to formulate our policies, we are effectively telling Singaporeans that these jobs are not fit to live in Singapore."
6077,It becomes a vicious cycle where we become too dependant on foreign workers for essential services.
6078,"As a singaporean Indian personally I haven’t experienced much racism other than the usual HAHAHA CAN’T SEE YOU when the lights are off (in the past, now not so much I suppose), my worst experience was my friends birthday party where the whole time her friends made various lame Indian jokes like the one above and kept trying to shine a light at me to “see me”."
6079,"If you’re coming here as a tourist you’ll be fine, there tends to be no overt racism here but it does exist in very rare cases but that’s Usually never to tourists."

6085,"As an Indian Muslim who's been living in the UK for the past 4 years, the uk is definitely less racist for me than singapore."
6086,As an Indian expat (who doesn't live in sg anymore) here's what I have to say: this caste system argument is absolutely bull shit and people who mention this can Fuck off.
6087,"But that isn't really the source of Indian expats in sg, is it?"
6088,"As an Indian who is an American citizen and spent half of my life in US, and has been living here for the last four, the author throws Singapore under the bus while conveniently neglecting to talk about the positives the government has done for the foreign workers as well as their families that are worried about them."
6089,"Does Singapore have racism, growing wealth inequality, unequal laws targeting minorities and LGBTs?"
6090,"As an Indian, I have met quite a lot of people who do hold somewhat racist views, but the vast majority hold those views due to a lack of interaction with other people groups or a lack of information, and are usually willing to learn more and change."
6091,"The worst culprits have to be old aunties and uncles though, they’re the ones that usually don’t want to change their views and take any racist views they hold as the gospel upon a race."
6092,"As an Indian, and someone who’s taken Mandarin as a mother tongue since P1, very honestly who are these Indians who cook curry everyday ah?"

6098,"There seems to be a new article every week on this subreddit with some random weirdo crying about life not being as cushy as they wanted, and this seems to be creating a bit of a false narrative to an extent here about most expats being entitled and oblivious to the effects of this pandemic on SG."
6099,"The reality that I've seen is that almost every expat I've had a conversation with in the last few weeks (across a range of countries) is supportive of the upcoming restrictions, and agree it makes complete sense."
6100,"As an expat of Indian origin, and not in finance sector - at least in my sector,  for expats of Asian origin , not at all :("
6101,As an expat of sorts...
6102,"As an expat, it's expected that you would take what OP has said personally."
6103,"But know that there is [evidence of hiring biases](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/mas-steps-up-engagements-with-key-financial-institutions-on-hiring-practices) so while your company may not be one of those that op is talking about, you should understand that there ARE people under the group that is expats being unfair to the locals in terms of job opportunities."
6104,"As an expat; ""yawn""."
6105,"As an immigrant from PRC who grew up in SG, s many of these points resonate with me."
6106,"but she refused to engage me I was so enraged that I was a victim of xenophobic behaviour in my own HDB estate, in which my wife and I own a unit."
6107,"As an immigrant too, it's easy; anything that they think might be valuable or at least _interesting_ to someone, they'll charge whatever their ""competitors"" charge for a similar service."
6108,I feel sad that foreign workers are stranded here more than a year away from their loved ones.
6109,"As an nth generation immigrant to n- countries my tip is to improvise, adapt, overcome."

6111,I know it's racist and it's not a democracy etc  I don't care.
6112,"As far as I know, none of the countries in VTL now and intented from Oct 19 has such remote working visa program."
6113,"Singapore needs foreign talent, not foreign trash."
6114,"As i said in my post earlier, i don't ascribe it to racism as much as i do to unfair hiring practices."
6115,"As in, the maid intended to use the false rape allegation as a means to escape employment."
6116,&#x200B;  >  A maid who had an affair with her employer's husband and had consensual sex with him on two occasions later lied to the police   That's actually the first line in the article.
6117,"As in, the maid shouldn't have been irritated?"
6118,"As long as VTL remains open to their home country, the foreigners majority in r/SG doesn't really care about the wellbeing of Singapore."
6119,"As long as children under 12 years are not exempt from the vaccination requirements, the VTL is useless for many families that want to travel for personal reasons."

6125,"As much as I fully agree that our migrant workers should be transitioning to having the freedom to go out much faster, I would be concerned what the article and its originator are trying to stir up here."
6126,"I don't recall SG Newspapers freaking advocating FDW to have full citizenship rights and what the earth Uyghurs are doing ""housed strategically"" in Xinjiang"
6127,Such as expatriating them to the domestic helper's country to serve as one for the same amount of time that they were mistreated and have their actions plastered all over the news and have a taste of their own medicine.
6128,"That said, I'm not saying that there isn't racism, its just as of now, there isn't anything to confirm nor deny the claims."
6129,"Having depression does not make you torture people, and does not justify such a lenient sentence especially since this wasn't an isolated incident: they did this to the maid over the course of *months*."
6130,"As much as a good portion of what he said can be construed as racist, and I certainly disagree with portions of them, the fact of the matter is that he came from a different time and tried to have a “realistic”, pragmatic view of the world, however wrong some parts of it may be."
6131,Call me an apologist if you will - I actually disagree with many of his views and opinions - but labelling him as a “master racist” is a bit disingenuous imo.
6132,"As much as people would like to say in this subreddit, stereotyping is a minor form of racism."

6138,"As part of hari raya celebrations in one of the dormitories, some friends and I have been given the go ahead to organize a 'game night' of sorts, wherein locals and residents interact and collaborate with migrant workers to complete the game objectives."
6139,"As per the [report](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/omicron-covid-19-imported-cases-vtl-singapore-moh-2397901) today, 41/53 of VTL Omicron cases were detected with the on-arrival PCR."
6140,"As racist as it sounds its a true fact: i've rented my condo unit to 3 different indian families over the past 10years (its farrer park, they love the location), and the kitchen walls permanently ooze curry smell now."
6141,"My guess is if you zoom out, every country in the world is seeing a net decrease in expats because people want to be close to their family during the COVID period."

6147,As someone who comes from a mixed background I'm expected to speak at least 2 languages however I make sure everyone knows I speak neither of my mother tongues.
6148,Employers may keep the passports of the helpers as MOM punishes the employers if the maid goes missing.
6149,Employers are also punished if the maid can no longer work because she gets pregnant.
6150,"You do not want your place cleared out when you are at work or worse, family members harmed because of the maid colluding with someone you wouldn't normally trust."
6151,"It may seem inhumane, but it has to be viewed that the employer-domestic helper relationship is very much different from the normal employer-employee relationship due to the amount of access the domestic helper has to carry out the tasks."
6152,"As someone who got confused, I think you meant to say:  If out of the general population, 15% are racist Chinese, 3% are racist Malays, and 1.8% are racist Indians, then  * Racist Indians and Malays are 6.4% the size of the Chinese population (4.8% vs 75% of general population)."
6153,"Admittedly, conditions can be improved for domestic helpers here."
6154,"As someone who has lived in Australia for most of my life and having to come back to serve NS, i've been taken aback by how racist the average local Singaporean is compared to our western counter part."
6155,The only difference is the racism displayed in this country is a lot more subtle where as it is displayed a lot more overtly in western countries by those who share racist sentiments.
6156,"As someone who has personally faced straight up and weird racism like this on public transport from siaolangs before, I really felt bad for them cos clearly they needed help."
6157,"Yes, it sucks to be a victim of such racism but if the person clearly has issues, I can cut them some slack at a personal level."
6158,As someone who have experienced living with probably about 10 maids in my lifetime.
6159,"I had first 2 maids, who stayed 10 years each."
6160,"And then the next 10+years, each maid stayed about 2 to 3 years each."
6161,"Then yea, that means EVERYONE including the maid."
6162,So expecting the maid to practice the same consideration is not unreasonable.
6163,"And like I do not think I have ever experienced a maid who took food not meant for her, without asking ever."
6164,Most maids don't do that.
6165,I dunno who is that person who tells employers to tolerate theft or tresspass from their maids.
6166,"One of our maids, whom we trusted and treated so well for 3 years."
6167,"Ya know, we once had a maid who was a 7 day Adventist, and we allowed her to go to church everyday."
6168,"Because my mom back then told me that this maid claim she is a 7 day adventist and her religion requires her to go to church everyday, so she gets 2 hours off every morning to go church, keep in mind, google doesn't exist back then."
6169,"Also, my mom is always very generous and reasonable towards her maids, so she just took her word for it."
6170,"Now I just googled and it doesn't even look like this maid was telling the truth, sheesh!)"
6171,"Now, with all the tests, VTL (restricted supply + surge in demand = increased prices), one can expect $800 minimally just to go back."

6173,"Maybe there really is a lot of racist slights and I'm just blur but hey, ignorance is bliss."

6177,The entire Singapore culture is racist?

6179,"As someone whose parents are from india,my best guess will be that that uncle is probably a grandparent of a immigrant family here:)"
6180,"We have so many racial/class issues that we could be discussing instead - discrimination of Malays, Marginalisation of Indians, ignorance of Eurasians, treatment of migrant workers, Pinkerton syndrome, the list goes on..."
6181,"As the son of Indian new citizen, honestly, I feel that these protests are done out of Xenophobia with CECA being a dog whistle for Indian Immigrant."
6182,Ramesh by his accent is almost certainly not a CECA immigrant as he has obviously stayed here for decades.
6183,"Additionally, CECA immigration protocols only apply to intracompany transfers for HQ offices and I'm pretty sure only a few thousands reside here under the scheme."
6184,Opposing CECA isn't xenophobic but the only connection between the Ramesh Incident and CECA is Indians.
6185,Can supporters of the protests explain why the protests are not about xenophobia?
6186,"As they have cultural similarities to the majority here, the backlash is not as great as with immigrants from another nation containing over a billion people."
6187,"Sure there will be those who question their place here,as seen with the local table tennis national team but it's not as great when the immigrants in question have a darker skin tone."
6188,These immigrants are NOT our ancestors.
6189,Not because they are treated like they are some precious foreign talent that the host country can't do without.
6190,"Then explain why majority of reported cases of taxi assaults and illegal cycling on expressways, and road rage involving cyclists ALMOST ALWAYS feature expats?"
6191,"List of characters can be anyone: Captain Underpants, Florence Nightingale, Vasco da Gama, Simone de Beauvoir, Aang, Dora the Explorer, Zheng He, Elon Musk, Our Founding Fathers, your primary school mother tongue teacher, secondary school drinks stall vendor, first workplace mentor, parents & grandparents, etc."
6192,"As we've seen in the past, foreign worker dormitories can become clusters with 1000+ daily cases."
6193,"If foreign workers mix with the community, we will be seeing daily community cases of not only 5k that the MMTF claims is manageable for sg."
6194,"If we have foreign workers living in HDB flats, of course we can lift their restrictions because the virus won't spread as quickly between them as in dormitories."
6195,Parent of a 2-year old and 2-month old with no domestic helper here.
6196,My argument is that racism in Singapore is not systemic and not institutionalised - and I am using racism here with a negative connotation.
6197,"As you pointed out, she is a racist even though she is mentally ill."
6198,"It's improper because (a) most of the people using it don't have the sort of relationship it implies and **therefore you're talking to someone as if they're a service staff**, (b) because even if you don't mean it offensively, you don't know whether the person you're addressing is Tamil or not, and (c) because it's been twisted into ah pu neh neh which is flat out racist."
6199,"I have not experienced any racism myself in the US, and I'm from a  city in Conservative Texas."
6200,"If safety and racism is what you're concerned about, the trade-off for your career/ future income is definitely worth it."
6201,"Aside from the self-tests to go out, both options require the same number of tests (one pre-departure and one upon arrival for VTL/exit SHN for non-VTL) so test costs are about the same."
6202,I heard it's in the thousands for some European VTLs though.
6203,"Aside from the wage, my family do mop the floor everyday even before we hired a maid."
6204,"Now during rest days for our maid, it’s either me or my grandmother mopping the floor, depending on who is home on the day."
6205,"I dunno if you're too young to realise this or something but an organisation the size of NTUC is not going to have magically uniform workplace culture in all of its branches, and even in general workplaces don't generally select employees based on how racist and mean they are."
6206,No matter where you work you have some chance of meeting people who are racist and mean.
6207,"In addition, as a JC kid, I think you just haven't been exposed to Singaporean culture outside your educated bubble...spoiler alert, many Singaporeans are very racist."
6208,"Chinese Singaporeans are racist to indian's and Malays, Indian Singaporeans are racist to Malays and Filipinos, Malays Singaporeans are racist to Indians and Filipinos (and occasionally chinese but it's less problematic), and many people are racist against black people despite the fact that black people aren't even a large population in Singapore."
6209,"Aside from your first point, which I can’t definitively say is not racist, fully agree with everything else."
6210,Assume Chinese people are racist.....
6211,"**Foreign talent influx (at all levels)**  We definitely need foreign talents and workers - both lower-level jobs such as constructions, and higher-level ones, such as those in the management level."
6212,Maybe this'll explain it better: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/what-drives-people-torture-enslave-home-psyche-serial-maid-abuse-14592696?cid=FBcna](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/what-drives-people-torture-enslave-home-psyche-serial-maid-abuse-14592696?cid=FBcna)
6213,"Assuming it is a VTL flight (and you do all the upfront things) and you can reasonably isolate yourself, you are free to get in a taxi home where you wait for the results."
6214,"Assuming that all korean families will make kimchi is literally racist, lol."
6215,"Assuming they’re living together, like those big household type can use other name to register which still be a danger to the maids."
6216,Either way it's true the govt has no choice now because they have set in place the foundations of how foreign workers are housed in SG and there is no practical way to change it now in such a short timeframe.
6217,"At face value, this is racism."
6218,"However, i disagree that there is systemic racism."
6219,"To have systemic racism, i believe it must be so widespread and commonplace that it becomes the norm, or if it is legislated to be acceptable to post such racist requirements."
6220,How can people be so openly racist like this!?
6221,This isn't so much of a racism problem but one of self-preservation and the inflicting of perceived injustice against them in their own country.
6222,"This may be different in other sectors that are more popular with local students, but in tech I'm certain that a lot of companies would be forced to either close or outsource if their access to foreign talent would be significantly reduced."
6223,"At least the VTL restrictions on travellers mean that for once the cross border buses won’t be triple booked, dump people at the border if they don’t get through passport control fast enough etc?"
6224,I find many SEA people to be blatantly racist.
6225,I also find many people where i'm from to be discreetly racist.
6226,At least they stopped pretending VTL is a bilateral agreement….
6227,At no point did I perform an analysis on CECA
6228,"> Multinational companies created the expat category, a sort of diplomat with a higher standard of living representing the firm far away and running its business there."
6229,He builds a social life with other expats.
6230,"At some point, I wonder if any of the people abusing the maids ever thought about how the maids could just as easily snap and assault them back."
6231,"At some point, if you're always trolling all sorts of racist/sexist/xenophobic/homophobic views, then you probably are at least sympathetic to those views."
6232,"As they say, if you constantly have to explain that ""I'm not really racist I'm just joking"", then yeah you probably are racist."
6233,"There must be an investigation into the practices of these dormitory operators, the actions (or lack thereof) of the political leadership, and if there has been undue influence of these shady businesses in the workings of our government."
6234,"This foreign worker policy has long stunted the growth of the 'local core', and there is no safe way to house all of them without the politically impossible policy  (NIMBYs) of building a vast HDB new town."
6235,At the end it'll be a weird situation in Singapore where only the foreign workers have immunity and can continue to work while the rest of the people on Singapore still need to be in lock down?
6236,"If they felt such a deep need to help the maids, the employers can always help them on their own personal capacity."
6237,"Doing extra to help these maids beyond the basics might not be particularly good for them either, maid agencies will pass the additional costs to the employer and reducing demand for maids."
6238,"At the same time, not everyone has maids, so it doesn't make sense to put any significant government spending on what is essentially a privileged luxury good."
6239,"Perhaps you shouldn't be asking about what the government has done, but ask the maid agencies instead."
6240,"Check out how the agencies you are interested in handle the maids, and to not engage their services if you aren't satisfied with their extra employment benefits."
6241,At the last part of the video there was a kid who said that she would wake her auntie whenever she jas nightmares to come sleep with her...  She's a child so its not unreasonable for her to ask for that since she doesn't know better but i pity the maid for having to wake up for this.
6242,At the moment they will only accept [vaccination certificates](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/requirements-and-process) from VTL countries and Singapore.
6243,So if you are vaccinated in Austria this is not accepted until Austria joins the VTL list.
6244,I'm hopeful that soon all Catagory II countries will join the VTL and their vaccine certificate will be accepted.
6245,"I interact with the average Singaporean as part of my job, and the casual racism/discrimination is strong."
6246,"At the rate on how migrant workers in dormitories are being treated in spite of all the concerns raised, i’m not going to be surprised if a full-blown riot occurs at some point in time in the future"
6247,"At the rate they’ve been announcing VTLs, Thailand May very well have one by January."
6248,I’m not sure the VTLs require you being vaccinated in the country you’re departing from - just make sure you have all the necessary documents proving you’re vaccinated.
6249,At the risk of wading into a messy discourse - would the context that LMW continued to claim that free movement of persons was used as a bargaining chip in negotiations (implying that there is something wrong with CECA's position on free movement of persons in 127 sectors) change your assessment?
6250,"To further clarify - if the issue is a misunderstanding of CECA (as OYK mentioned in his response to LMW, referencing Helen Poa's queries), then I think a charitable interpretation of PSP's position on CECA (i.e."
6251,"But if contextual clues suggest that PSP (or at least, LMW) does not merely misunderstand CECA, then is it fair to continue to affix a charitable interpretation of the claim that ""free movement"" should be interpreted within FTA confines?"
6252,"&#x200B;  As mentioned in parliament, and of official government records, let's reiterate that **CECA does not allow the free movement of natural persons (i.e."
6253,&#x200B;  This sub seems to continuously conflate the problems in our economy with CECA.
6254,"**These are important issues that must be addressed,** but these issues will still exist without CECA."
6255,&#x200B;  Shutting out foreign talents does not equate to more job for Singaporeans if those companies don't even want to come to Singapore in the first place.
6256,"Access to freedom is a basic human right, understandably that was impinged on sitting Covid but now that these people are vaccinated and we're in an endemic situation this is impossible to explain past pure racism."
6257,"At this point I feel like they are putting every ""restriction"" possible to appease the shutdowners other than cancelling VTL.... which I'm ok with for now...."
6258,At this point i think a mandatory mental health check of employers before employing maid should be done.
6259,"It's not racism per se, but in general humans and even animals have a natural tendency of identity and segregation."
6260,"It's a trait in some people, and even if they don't use racism to push their agenda, they'll use other characteristics."
6261,"At this point, anyone who makes a statement about race can be labelled as racist by the internet."
6262,He still acknowledged rental and job discrimination but yet that didn't stop some woke liberals from calling him racist
6263,"There are quite many Upper Class Indians who would be so eager to jump in and be the reference point, by saying that they have not been affected by racism at all."

6268,There was a great deal of racist bullying/teasing/ostracism; people would mock or make snarky remarks about your appearance and accent on an almost daily basis.

6274,"Aussie expat here, and here’s my rant — yes, many helpers are poorly treated by their employers, and it’s tempting to judge the whole country as being cruel and unfeeling, but these attitudes towards servants were prevalent in Western countries probably as recently as the middle of the 20th century (just look at the southern states of the US, seriously)."
6275,"For expats the go-to areas are mainly around Holland village / river valley / Novena, or up along the east coast."
6276,"Don't let the racism fool you, Australia has a massive immigration program, it's the only thing driving population and economic growth for the last ten years plus."
6277,Did not experience any racism myself while i was there but i did have friends who were egged on by cars driving by.
6278,"There were also incidents of finance lecturers being unsympathetic towards the foreign students and more apathetic towards the locals, could easily chalk that up as bias towards locals than your usual racism."
6279,"There was this incident where a friend of my who was doing medicine, had this post grad lab assistant that was obviously racist towards asians where he would only provide proper guide and teachings to the westerners and was non responsive to the asians/chinese."
6280,"Overall, day to day, there's rarely any racism,  people there are more enthusiastic when it comes to service and loves chatting you up, ie store clerks at EB games talking to you about their favorite game titles while you're at the cashier."
6281,"My understanding is that pay is very good for international teachers here, and as you are still based in Aus you could likely get an expat package."
6282,"Anyway, I don't think the racists are thinking so much into justifying their actions, at least not until they are caught or called out for their actions."
6283,Albeit he came over before CECA.
6284,"Author: Kirsten Han  In the years that I've spent in the company of migrant labour rights organisations and activists, reporting on issues that migrant workers in Singapore face, this is an argument that has cropped up over and over again.According to this argument, migrant workers' conditions in Singapore are not so bad, because it's better than what they have back home (i.e."
6285,"In conversations with people in Singapore, I find that sometimes the impression of where migrant workers have come from is somewhat skewed, informed by ideas and stereotypes of their home countries."
6286,"There are also many migrant workers with diplomas and degrees, even advanced degrees."
6287,"When migrant workers think of coming here, what did they know of “here”?On my first trip to Bangladesh, I started chatting with one of the staff members at the guest house."
6288,"*Even if* conditions back in Bangladesh or India were so poor that even a dormitory in Singapore is an improvement, that doesn’t mean that Singapore — a city-state that takes pride in punching above our weight and being “world-class” — should be setting the bar so low."
6289,"If we’re so successful and so outstanding, we should have more capacity to think about quality of life, not just for citizens, but for everyone who lives in Singapore, including migrant workers."
6290,"After all, migrant workers prop up the country in very real ways, from cleaning HDB estates to building malls like Marina Bay Sands and Jewel, that help us shine on the international stage.And if anyone says that we can’t possibly do better because we can’t afford it, or because it’ll destabilise or ruin the economy, then I think Singapore will need to do more hard thinking about whether we’re really comfortable with our economic system being built on such unjust, and ultimately unsustainable, structures."
6291,People who judge blindly don't really have much weight themselves so there's really no need to concern for racism in our country.
6292,And it also showed me how many expats there here considering i got downvoted into oblivion on many of the points.
6293,"Awesome, so from what I'm reading it sounds like even if there is some racism it's not overt and just takes the form of snide remarks and odd glances which I'm more than capable of dealing with haha."
6294,"But until  all the races here would learn how to live with each other in harmony, racism will still plague this country."
6295,A lot of the racists here tend to have the insane level of ignorance along with it.
6296,Ayo I'm not an SJW but this is seriously 100% racism.
6297,Please lah I understand wanting more jobs for locals but what ur saying is 100% racism
6298,I am not racist.
6299,The racists in our region share the same mindset as the racists in the West.
6300,I have an Indian friend in Singapore who kept getting dragged into indirect racist conversations.
6301,He told me those racists usually asked him why he is not dark enough as he told them he’s an Indian.
6302,So the point is BLM still needs to be promoted for awareness here because our society still needs to be educated on racism.
6303,I responded to calls at a workers dormitory.
6304,For the past couple of weeks I've been going down to several different dormitories to take samples from these foreign workers.
6305,"Background: My Grandfather is 94 years old, an immigrant from Hainan (Hainan (海南) is an island province at the southernmost part of China)."
6306,Bad news - we still differentiate between VTL flights and non VTL flights for no reason.
6307,"Nobody is making a blanket statement that Singaporeans are racist or xenophobic, but it is extremely clear that racism and xenophobia have been festering and growing."
6308,"Making decisions based on the assumption that everyone will behave the same way is damaging, and frankly not what Singapore, an immigrant nation, should be.   """
6309,"Ban China, ban UK, ban South Africa not racist, but now ban India become racist."
6310,Ban her from all jobs except maid
6311,Band maid?
6312,"Indian from India and Chinese from China, yes these are often targets of racist comments and jokes."
6313,Banning flights from a country with a huge surge in case isn't racist.
6314,But basically the point I was trying to make is that casual racism is there and Mediacorp's video is just close enough to the friendly banter that you should be worried because friendly banter can quicky become something more especially when it's one of the main media companies.
6315,"He is racist to innocent Chinese people doing their jobs, he even attacked two nurses and called an Indian Doctor “too light skinned”."
6316,These redditors confirm downvote you because their brains cannot comprehend minorities can be racist.
6317,"Cuz I'm xenophobic, and don't act like y'all aren't."
6318,-SDP's proposal for a minimum wage would also protect low-wage migrant workers who can't afford proper accommodation and nutrition.
6319,Based on my experiences and those of my colleagues usually still the top of the top who are offered expat packages.
6320,I mean to work at big4 or some multinational finance companies who usually tend to send expats you need to be better than the rest of the people in your the country.
6321,"Based on some of the clearly expat comments here, we can also flip the narrative."
6322,"Clearly these expats don’t want to be here because, apparently, singapore sucks."
6323,"Based on the 500, how long on average before a migrant worker can leave dormitory again, assuming that the dorm is able to fulfill all the requirements?"
6324,Based on this logic the government does not have to apologize to migrant workers.
6325,"Based on what others have shared on this thread, it isn’t legal to pass the costs of covid testing and quarantine on to the FDW, so the contract isn’t relevant here."
6326,"They already have problems making ends meet, and by their own definition, they are not racist because they would have friends of other races and nationalities and don’t go out of their way to discriminate against other races…  I do not claim that they are racist for simply being part of a majority."
6327,"Basically he said ""they just abused a maid, not a dog"""
6328,Basically letter writer is trying to tell us that the migrant workers should be grateful for even having a bed and a fan in their cockroach infested  dormitories.
6329,"Ok, next time my mother blame me for leaving my food out and attracting cockroaches, I am going to tell her it’s not me, it’s the migrant workers."
6330,"But the moment their comfort is compromised then bam, die die must defend their maids."
6331,"Attributing desirability purely based on nationality is not racist, but that is xenophobic, and equally unacceptable."
6332,Basically whatever the SP student said that came in the [news](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/h7ce93/singapore_polytechnic_student_racist_posts/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)...like sayin dowanna do this and that with minorities and basically despising tagging along with other races and holding prejudices and stereotypes about other races...look ik thr is a manner to joke about it but yall shd be sensible enough when and where to do so yea
6333,"Bc too many immigrants, that's why racial harmony is down the drain."
6334,My parents' english is very broken and they still cling to their racist ways such as keeping a wide berth whenever a dark skinned person walks near us.
6335,"Thus, maidenless."
6336,Be glad that you have a job delivering food to the expats here.
6337,"When you eating chocolate or buying ice cream, offer some to your maid."
6338,"I understand that family is important and you can't scold or stop your grandmother, but you can help in other ways like talking to your maid and keeping her company while she works."
6339,It may not seem like much but most maids are lonely and underappreciated.
6340,I don't even think either of them are racist.
6341,"The fear is that ""racist"",""discriminatory"",""hateful"",""inciteful"" etc are all very loaded and emotional words, and because of the rational and deserved intolerance towards racists, it is very easy to avoid an argument by just labelling someone you find disagreeable as a racist, and the argument just devolves into name-calling and ad hominem attacks."
6342,"It doesn't help that there is a perception (true or not, I honestly don't know) that there are many racists that pretend to be civil and argue in bad faith, and it's very hard to differentiate these people from those who are genuinely curious and willing to learn."
6343,Definitely not as high a demand as other non-English speaking countries but many foreigners and expats who have moved here need those services.
6344,Because I don't like racist people.
6345,I'm not saying it's unnatural to think that they're xenophobic.
6346,"Do you think it's equally likely that their intentions ""behind posting such a statement cannot be anything else other than the poster being a xenophobic asshole taking advantage of the current crisis to unleash his very unpolitically correct point of view on a (relatively) safe platform"" for both cases as the earlier comment suggests?"
6347,"But I would also like to state, the hidden racism (which seems to have always existed) *has* dampened my interest in Singapore in the past few months."
6348,Because Jade not migrant worker /s
6349,"When the landlord is in his own ""private sphere"" of his household, him being racist does not directly affect anyone/any parties in the public sphere."
6350,a landlord who lets his racist tendencies carry over into his job when he's interacting with multi-racial tenants.
6351,Politicians who have espoused racist opinions in private still mostly face repercussions as a result.
6352,"A landlord who holds racist opinions is may also let that affect them when they go back to the ""public sphere"" when working."
6353,Words like oppression and racism are going to lose their meaning if they can't even reflect reality.
6354,A sizable population is still pretty racist.
6355,Because employer needs the other $80 to hire 1 or more other foreign workers to do the job of the 1 on quarantine.
6356,"I don't know where you've heard the ""notorious open immigration policy"" but it doesn't happen in Singapore."
6357,"When shit happens to foreign workers, we just think of it as another workplace incident and move on with our lives."
6358,Because expats are affected more by closed borders - their families are overseas.
6359,Most of the expats are not asking for tourism and leisure travel.
6360,"THAT is why border controls matter more to expats, my friend."
6361,Why is it racist when a non Indian tries to use Tamil word?
6362,> Preference by race is racist.
6363,"Congratulations, by this measure the vast majority of the world is racist."
6364,"Because if we are setting up targets, our domestic helpers and foreign labourers have been the target board for every single thing, even if it didn't warrant for such behaviour."
6365,Because in April 2 migrant workers died and 15 were injured following a collision in one of these open backed trucks :( travelling like this can be extremely dangerous for them.
6366,"I think we can safely infer that in the malay culture, there is a strong emphasis on verbal communication using the malay language, and as a natural result, they are consistently performing well in their mother tongue."
6367,"Note that my inference does not take away anything from the other 3 major races in Singapore, and their relatively weaker scores may not necessarily mean the erosion of the emphasis in speaking to each other in their mother tongue(although I suspect that this may be the case)"
6368,"When some drama happens, like the alleged ""the last waffle was reserved for the Chinese man and I was not allowed to eat it,"" the Chinese once again becomes the image of systematic oppression, racism and debauchery."
6369,Tolerant because not many wants to openly accept that they are racist but hide behind 'willing buyer - willing seller' etc.
6370,"I would give a very clear indicator of educational performance, rather than the lazy CMIO breakdown."
6371,"Because it doesn’t fit “the message” that the minority is being oppressed by the Chinese majority, and some people don’t like the implication that racism is an issue that is experienced and caused by both sides, because it runs counter to the narrative that all their problems are being caused by someone else."
6372,Because it has been amplified by the CECA discussion.
6373,"It is not to say that racism did not exist before, but it can be heighted due to external factors."
6374,They would have experienced casual and institutionised racism.
6375,"If you have ever hired freelance cleaners, you will come across maids involved in this scam."
6376,Because it's a foreign worker that died.
6377,"Because it's just racism/xenophobia at this point (or at the very least, dog whistle)."
6378,Because it’s a foreign worker?
6379,It's easy to cry and whine racism anytime something based on stereotyping is mentioned.
6380,"Because low-income migrant workers come from India, China and Bangladesh."
6381,Because maids might bring their boyfriends home to fuck while everyone is out.
6382,"Also when I was younger I lived near a landed cluster and taxis would queue up all afternoon outside one unit, turns out the maid was whoring herself when the owners were out at work."
6383,"And given most of us who don’t find this racist are likely Chinese, that doesn’t mean it isn’t racially insensitive in some way to some of the Malay & Muslim community."
6384,Yes we all might disagree on whether this is racism or not (like with your definition of racism) - but we clearly all understand this is rather culturally or racially insensitive on some level at least and displays ignorance (beyond just copyright infringement).
6385,"Honestly it’s frustrating to see everyone say ‘it’s not racism she’s just overdoing it, they alr apologize lah let it go’ instead of seeing the problems here that should be addressed by the PA."
6386,"When the local men are sacrificed to defend the country from foreign invaders, we can always import foreign talents after to replace the local men  /S ?"
6387,Because minorities in that case will always be the one that the markets say are okay to be racist towards.
6388,"This, you are saying it’s okay to be racist in certain market conditions or against a minority"
6389,A worker / expat / foreigner has the same chances to spread the virus of a resident damaging the entire country and the people.
6390,Because not a single maid asked for it
6391,You think there won’t be backlash if there is a racist allegation and there is no action taken subsequently?
6392,"Because of one clown, the rest of the migrant workers will face harsher restrictions"
6393,"R. Madhavan**  _Short film, made by a migrant worker_  This film is simple."
6394,It's about a migrant worker's salary day.
6395,"It details the saga of this migrant worker, who got badly injured at work."
6396,**Q&A**  This Q&A had a migrant worker there.
6397,Not all migrant workers are blatantly abused.
6398,"Because of the working conditions created over the years (high workload, relatively low wages, rely on foreign workers, etc) we indeed struggle to find sufficient healthcare staff."
6399,Because r/singapore grew up as a subreddit for expats.
6400,But expats are still a significant part of the bread and butter of redditors in here.
6401,"When politicians here campaign on the myth that Singapore was a ""sleepy fishing village"" before the Party took over, or scare people with the assertion that ""if we let just anybody run things, pretty soon your wife and daughters will have to work as maids in some other country"", *and the Party is in virtually total control of political messaging,* it's not too difficult to argue that voting for the Party is ""rational self-interest""."
6402,Because racism.
6403,By your logic if a Chinese Singaporean person doesn’t talk about how NS discriminate against Malays in Singapore she also cannot complain about racism she faces in the US if someone calls her a chink is it it.
6404,It's a bit sickening  Look at how petty the CAG dude and his son / family behaved towards their maid
6405,Because the OP specifically said FDW and nothing else.
6406,Because the maid should be grAtEfuL for having a job here and get GoOd mOnEy
6407,Who didn’t regulate the dormitory owners properly ?
6408,Because there is a difference between migrant workers and experienced white color professionals.
6409,"It does not matter what color your skin is, if you are a seasoned professional and recruited international you are an expat."
6410,Because there's no such thing as a minimal wage expat.
6411,Because they are CECA obsessed
6412,Because they are racist.
6413,"Government pls don't forget about our migrant workers, they too need as much freedom as ""we do""."
6414,Because they have residency status which confers them certain rights and ~~expats~~ economic immigrants don't?
6415,Because they treat the maid like a kid and they love hitting their own kids.
6416,It's a Singaporean indian shouting at indian expats.
6417,"', but unlike those issues, racist and xenophobic discourse is something that we can do something about, and which we have taken action against."
6418,Because this kind of racism has deleterious consequences for Singaporean Indians?
6419,Because those were perfectly indicative of PAP Pte Ltd Land's attitude towards migrant workers.
6420,Because those who only speak english and their mother tongue are not going to post about their ordinary language skills.
6421,We just need to look at how people view and treat their domestic helpers like second-class individuals
6422,Because we would naturally think that everyone is non-racist.
6423,entire expat household not vaccinated).
6424,"This imo do not warrant an explicit apology, but we are showing via our actions to compensate the migrant workers now."
6425,How many times have you said thanks or bought a meal for the foreign migrant worker doing cleaning?
6426,"Bed is in your boss room- I have no idea who the fuck puts the maid's bed in the master bedroom, but whatever."
6427,2) Is it racist to only buy from Indian prata stalls?
6428,I can't even imagine how I'd feel if I was in the situation that the foreign workers are in.
6429,Been here for 7-8 years under employment pass.. Everybody asked me when will I apply for PR status.
6430,For instance - [https://expatliving.sg/guide-to-living-in-leedon-heights/](https://expatliving.sg/guide-to-living-in-leedon-heights/) which provide readers a primer of the Leedon Heights district.
6431,Will be a good compilation for any potential new visitor/expat to Singapore!
6432,Most Singaporeans don't understand the last point because they have become accustomed to vegetable sellers in the wet market who are also *legal* immigrants or PR's.
6433,Nevertheless it's not very nice to demand the maid to do more simply because he wants to make more of his money's worth.
6434,"She yelled at me for being racist, threw her plate of food at me."
6435,"At that time, I had no idea what I did wrong and honestly felt a little hurt (all I was trying to do, was trying to offer her food) and I get called racist?"
6436,"Before all the haters against foreigners come in - this figure is misleading as it’s only looking at expat packages, so someone getting sent to SG within a company from somewhere else, sometimes not even with a local contract."
6437,"Before criticising Chinese Singaporeans for not speaking their mother tongue well, you may want to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IvbnavLocA)."
6438,Saying 99.99% of Chinese Singaporeans cannot speak their mother tongue is not correct as most Chinese Singaporeans can speak their mother tongue.
6439,"They mix in English words from time to time, but this does not mean they cannot speak their mother tongue."
6440,"Before my trip to Australia (Melbourne), I saw a post on Korea VTL and thought it would’ve been useful if there is a similar one for Australia, so here it is!"
6441,"Before we get into the ""Singaporeans are racist"" rant again."
6442,"Unlike in Imperial China, the colonial authorities tend to not be very strict on the religious practices of locals and immigrants."
6443,"Furthermore, Chinese immigrants to then Malaya and Indonesia tend to not be very strict with their religion."
6444,"Before you reply i cant help noticing you have been very very defensive all over this thread, even when you acknowledge there's racism you keep reiterating other countries are worse as a defence tic."
6445,Noone is saying you are racist man.
6446,"We dont have public beatdowns here sure, but we do have racism and we do have cases of abuse all the time towards foreign workers and maids."
6447,An equivalent situation here would be the cases in the foreign worker community.
6448,"Like what you have said, I also don’t see it as racism."
6449,Way more racists in those places
6450,"Being a domestic worker may be a low paying job here, but it still pays a lot more than what some of these workers would have been paid back home."
6451,It's not racist to reject them if they have such a history.
6452,It's only racist if you make big assumptions about a potential tenant based on their race without any other information.
6453,Being a maid is a decent job and shouldn't be offensive.
6454,"In the Philippines, maids were used to be called *katulong* (helper), but now they are more commonly called *kasambahay* (household member) which affirms the dignity of the work that they do for the family."
6455,Being born Indian in Singapore means growing up with racism and learning to laugh a lot of it off.
6456,"I've probably repressed most of my memories of racist encounters, but there's one that's always seared in my mind."
6457,Your parents sound like racist scumbags....and sadly they may not be the only ones.
6458,"Being heavily involved in interfaith and interracial events, i can tell you that racism is very much rampant in Singapore  that i have participants telling me that they are surprised when they go by a day without any racism..it is a daily phenomenon..and being a minority myself,  i can tell you that it is fucking annoying to be a freaking 5th gen singaporean in sg and being treated like some 3rd class citizen as compared to an immigrant from China or a Malaysian Chinese that has newly settled down in SG."
6459,"Being racist doesn't feel like it should result in deportation, maybe just getting suspended/expelled from the school is good enough, it's her choice whether to give a public apology and try to appeal the suspension/expulsion or to fuck off back to France."
6460,"Going by your example, the vast majority of the world is now racist by an overwhelming amount if you are unable to separate the difference between racism and racial preferences."
6461,Believe it or not Reddit sometimes upvotes racist comments!
6462,"Nice mental projection by someone who professed to living in an expat bubble, but the term ""brown people"" isn't commonly used here:  >I do work in the CBD and live in an ""expat"" neighborhood I feel that sometimes don't get the full experience."
6463,"Whatever they may be, saying that X nationality should never be given upper management positions is kinda dumb and definitely racist."
6464,"Besides point 3, which I would argue is not racist, none of these points apply in Singapore in any systemic way."
6465,"Besides the blatant disrespect for the maid, I think if the maid is abused, they may end up building resentment for your grandma."
6466,"So please- if you are unable to improve your grandma's attitude and behaviour...when you are over at their place, or anyone you know is, please remind them to be kind to the maid."
6467,"Besides the extra testing requirements, if I am traveling via VTL (from UK) do I also have to do 7 days SHN?"
6468,But here we are discussing about some people insisting on eugenics to promote racism as apart from global humane aspirations such as equity and equality for all.
6469,Better than pretending that no racism exists and we live in a post-racial society
6470,"You imagine they do this stuff to the maid, what sort of moral education they giving to their children."
6471,Better to speak & scold directly to the racist person.
6472,Continuing with the same nurse to inject the racist person will just escalate situation and letting her to direct any sort trouble/blame to the nurse.
6473,"Next time you see someone shouting at their maid, imagine your boss doing the same to you at work."
6474,"No more quarantine, VTLs, events of up to 1000, jam-packed malls etc."
6475,"Bitch, kids of immigrants who are born and raised here and serve NS are not considered Singaporeans for you?"
6476,"Black people in Singapore are mostly seen as ""westerner expats"", not ""black people""."
6477,They're not the target of racism here.
6478,I believe every country has their own different racism.
6479,"If you want to know racism in Singapore, you need to interview South Asians, not black people."
6480,"Interviewing black people for racism in Singapore shows that the ""journalists"" just use their American-centric view and don't bother to check the context in the other countries."
6481,"Blackface/brownface/yellowface etc were used for very obviously racist purposes in the past, and even though in the present day it's more likely to be ""possibly racist"" than ""definitely racist"", it should be used with extreme caution."
6482,"Im 100% sure this was happening even before China got nationalistic and ""racist"""
6483,"If the rules are similar to VTL you have pay $240 for each trip into JB for the pre-departure and post-arrival PCR test, insurance of $30k, and remain isolated after arrival until your PCR result is out, is it worth it?"
6484,It's sad to hear the frequent horrible stories of domestic helpers getting abused and manual workers getting into accidents.
6485,Never once did I mention that I am racist.
6486,Booked my VTL flight 3 weeks ago... \*sioghiehfskljgdf\*
6487,"Booked to go to Aust with the family in 3 days time.... we are cancelling.... 72 hrs QT would be manageable, but if it extended to 7 or 14 and then if SG stops VTL and adds QT back at this end, it would be crazy."
6488,Boomers are xenophobic
6489,Boomers can be really racist one..
6490,Just wondering: has anyone witnessed a racist or xenophobic attack or verbal abuse in Singapore?
6491,"The only few things that most agree are anti homophobia,  anti racist and anti Mad Hatter."
6492,Both [numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&country2=Singapore&city1=London&city2=Singapore) and [expatistan](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/london/singapore) seem to suggest that on average Singapore is relatively close to London prices (or even slightly cheaper across most categories bar groceries).
6493,Both are racist.
6494,"But when you equate these two to race, by saying I prefer to hire a Chinese or I prefer not to rent to Indians, then that is racist."
6495,Both issues are talking about racism at its core.
6496,"Whether it is extreme like in US or subtle, racism is racism and is it unforgivable no matter how small or big it is."
6497,Both parents must work to buy a HDB flat for the family and the maid helps looks after the kids while the parents are away.
6498,This is where FDWs can come in to help out.
6499,"The only way we can reduce reliance on FDWs is to encourage more fathers/mothers to become full-time parent, which is practically inconceivable for the majority of the workforce."
6500,"Then again when one is taking in 5-figures, why do all the hard work when you can now hire a FDW?"
6501,"To summarise, no, we are not likely to reduce our reliance on FDWs anytime soon."
6502,"Bottom Line: -Everyone is racist -Facebook is a public venue -Your digital reputation carries to your workplace  In other news:  Has the franchise ""Beard Papa's"" completely left the island?"
6503,I am not xenophobic because i have had many close friends who are not singaporeans.
6504,I am not racist because my best friend from jc is an indian.
6505,British expat living in Sg.
6506,"Wanted to find out how us Brits are viewed in general, and as expats in your country!"
6507,"Bro I'm not surprised  India indians are fucking jialat one, they are racist in their own country amongst their own people with caste system and skin colour/language and shit"
6508,"But this time its a ""foreign talented candidate"" because our soul is only valued as:  ***WAAAHHHH SWEE MORE QUOTA!."
6509,Bro it's just a video of a maid and a mom
6510,"Bro read it again pretty sure he is mopping and ironing clothes at his own houses, while maid and mum is at mum's house."
6511,Bro try own a maid and have one running away and getting pregnant.
6512,And also wtf the racist part is extremely ridiculous.
6513,"Bro, he's a white expat who posted 2 weeks ago about ""living in expat bubble"" and now he is a race relations expert."
6514,">I do work in the CBD and live in an ""expat"" neighborhood I feel that sometimes don't get the full experience."
6515,"How about we set up a migrant worker woodland transport fund - do a deed, buy a seat."
6516,Ensure all migrant workers can reach their workplace safely.
6517,"Bro, please go and give your maid access to the WiFi."
6518,"I agree that it was racist, but my point of contention was the accusation that the agent is racist here."
6519,"Plus my follow-up point on why is it extremely unlikely for agents to be racist or even act out their racist tendencies, so chances are that the racist one here are the landlords."
6520,Cos FDW employment contract different from FT. FT more or less got fixed office hours.
6521,Your FDW dont have.
6522,I've been in Singapore 6 years and genuinely never seen a country so racist.
6523,"They stared at us, calling us racist and splat hokkien vulgar words over that small incident."
6524,That's so little at least put 10k for all the crap she did to that poor maid
6525,"What's the point of ""VTL"" if we have to go through all this bs."
6526,"Bruh racist pricks , a kid is gone and they make shit jokes like this"
6527,Ur not discriminating any race so ofc it isnt racist
6528,VTLs don't make sense in today's world and are a drag on our recovery and/or a cashgrab for SIA while other countries in Asia are closed.
6529,You're fortunate to be an expat in Singapore.
6530,"I suppose that's one of the benefits of being an expat in a ""hyperprivatised"" country like over here, as long as I can afford it I can get whatever I want - including medical treatment."
6531,"Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and India have high rates of FDW as well."
6532,"You wrote: > used the plight of the foreign workers (a very real problem) as an accessory to explain how her ""civil liberties"" was curtailed  Nowhere in the article did she actually complain about that."
6533,*  Where does the above even mention migrant workers being infected?
6534,"> For example, the dormitory problem was cast as such because of the fact that she cannot leave the house without a mask  Also where does she complain about this?"
6535,The only time she mentioned migrant workers was highlighting the blindspot of our Covid response.
6536,She spoke about the immediate CB after the dormitory cases have exploded but is that not true?
6537,The donning of masks and the dormitory situation were mentioned separately in the article and she never made the connection between the two.
6538,"The same will go for CECA and FTAs - a policymaker must consider the good of society as a whole, not just individuals."
6539,"Our maid was such a spectacular cook, that..., we often prefer her cooking to our actual mom."
6540,"The other thing is, this maid of our was college educated."
6541,"I ask her why she don't find a job in Philippines and she said the salary for a school teacher or a admin clerk is worst than a maid in Singapore, so here she was."
6542,Fuck you racists and your stereotypes.
6543,"That forms the very basis of prejudice, be it racism, sexism, xenophobia etc."
6544,"If staff see a family abusing their maid like that, that should qualify."
6545,"The mandatory mother tongue policy has been a disastrous failure, not just because it utterly failed to teach Singaporeans to speak Chinese and not just because it is based on a whole bunch of stupid racial essentialist ideas."
6546,"Criticising racism in SG is a good thing, but mindlessly putting our country down without any objective facts is a counterproductive move that dishonours the progress we've achieved and harms ethnic minorities."
6547,Business or company employers generally have much deeper pockets and business budget than a household family who have hired a maid for their personal need.
6548,"But Critical Race Theory is not that, it's just the study of legislative, cultural and social factors that preserves racism as an institution"
6549,But I thought that the woke crowd told me minorities cannot be racist?
6550,Because racism = discrimination + power.
6551,"The woman who hurled the insults is a minority herself, so by that logic, she cannot be racist."
6552,This form of racism is why Scarlett Johansson played a Japanese woman in Ghost In The Shell.
6553,"Kal Penn from Harold & Kumar [showed](http://jezebel.com/kal-penn-reveals-the-racist-roles-hollywood-wanted-him-1793299140) a whole list of scripts he was given, and the characters he was asked to play because he's Indian."
6554,">but when Shrey does something like this, insinuating that the Chinese population at large is racist and discriminatory, of course people--even the good ones-- are going to get incensed."
6555,But VTL still need.. why the discrepancies..
6556,Japan has never had to deal with a major minority group and it's unclear if their society is capable of either integrating immigrants or transitioning to a multi-ethenic enviorment.
6557,"But all those kids raised by maids are always so delightful, with such good manners."
6558,"But apart from criminal records, on what basis can you determine if someone is a fit employer for FDWs or not?"
6559,"The unfortunate truth is that most maid abusers are perfectly civil, and even friendly to their social equals."
6560,"But as a foreign worker, do I still require my employer to obtain government permission for me to fly?"
6561,"Its well known how class status can shield someone from the vile nature of racism  I know some upper class Indians, would deny racism of the most vile kind, just because they personally never experienced it, or they dnt have anyone in their social circle experiancing it."
6562,"But but according to Critical Race Theory, minorities can’t be racist!"
6563,"But can people travel out of Singapore via VTL flight for example, Malaysia?"
6564,"If you say yes, then yup you are racist :-)."
6565,But closing VTLs will stop you all from getting richer lah... understood
6566,But demonstrations of racism don’t require racist intent.
6567,But did any migrant worker asked for an apology?
6568,That's what racism means.
6569,What racism is there?
6570,I mean this is how racist war started and I don't think we need a version 2.0 anytime.
6571,"But given the recent surge in cases in India, **other than migrant workers**, shouldnt we stop all other travelers from India?"
6572,But has Dr Tan personally come across a single migrant worker that has demanded an easing of their restrictions?
6573,But he surely would have come across many business leaders complaining about high cost of providing decent living conditions to migrant workers...
6574,"But if he didn’t explicitly make any racist remarks, how can he be labelled as a racist?"
6575,"Call him whatever you want, racist isn’t one of them"
6576,"But if the basic treatment of maids/FDWs doesn't change, it's just a euphemism treadmill, and ""FDW"" will eventually have negative connotations."
6577,"I use ""maid"" because it's 1 syllable."
6578,"But if the expats are leaving, then sinkies should be getting those jobs, right?"
6579,"But if they never ""expose"" their racism, then that's not a problem for society or the legal system."
6580,"If all racists are scared into appearing non-racist at all times, but they still think like racists internally... then racism is solved as far as I am concerned, because thoughtcrime is not a crime, and the state shouldn't be so intrusive as to try to control peoples' private thoughts anyway."
6581,"But if you are making the distinction (as I should have done) then we can talk about how those 'kinds of immigrant workers' cannot ""easily go back to their home country"" as you put it."
6582,But if you arrive by VTL there’s no SHN.
6583,It's not as if there are racists actively trying to take down minorities.
6584,But is it a VTL flight?
6585,"Given the Chinese government's history of underreporting (see: SARS), do you think travel bans on China are still xenophobia-driven?"
6586,"When dorms shutdown for reasons like this, BTOs get further delayed, foreign workers get restless and act out (understandably tbh), they also contribute to more spread of the disease here one way or another."
6587,And it may be hard to believe but I do think many younger Singaporeans do care about how we treat our migrant workers.
6588,The government would be foolish to think mismanagement of migrant worker welfare would not be detrimental to their popularity.
6589,It’s racist if you think Malay or Indian or Chinese nurses are different because they likely went through the same training.
6590,You don't want to give ammo to racist?
6591,"We only say we're against racism, as long as they don't beat you up because of your race, its allowed to be practiced."
6592,But it’s also racist.
6593,But it’s still true that the most expensive parts of Singapore are filled with expats and foreigners.
6594,So there are still many expats with large relocations packages.
6595,"But land VTL doesn't pump money into SIA and Changi Airport, so you can wait long long."
6596,But let's say the agency created profile of the maids on LinkedIn and advertising themselves?
6597,But maids are humans too they have tastebuds that work equally well as ours.
6598,"If i have friends who mistreat maids, they probably wont be my friends anymore."
6599,Also this isn't about maid as an object.
6600,"The virus does not discriminate based on nationality and if an expat contracts it and passes it on to locals, isn't that everyone's problem?"
6601,"Granted it was only a 3 week gap and probably won't make much difference, but this combined with xenophobic comments like yours really don't help"
6602,Don't forget that making judgements based on just one term a person says is itself stereotyping as you are jumping to conclusions that a person is racist cause they used a certain term that offends you.
6603,"But no quarantine either   If there is a slip from the existing VTL, then that's it"
6604,Giving the chance to expat is like giving your money to corrupt but competent official.
6605,Let’s say some kid says another kid is racist.
6606,It’s not clearly racist but possibly racist.
6607,Or is the message then that cleverly disguised racism is kinda ok since those acts don’t get punished?
6608,But racism didn’t start in the 80’s.
6609,But really ah the CECA damn good at smoking.
6610,She labelled the act and the fact that it *does* perpetuate racist culture.
6611,"You and I both know the impact of casual racism on our everyday lives - yes there's often no intent, but it hurts."
6612,But she isn’t any more racist than the average Singaporean.
6613,So why Tag(bimbo/racist) something so Sensitive on her.
6614,But still a maid killer?
6615,"But still, no one here can place the work permit holders not living in dorms into any of these 3 categories."
6616,I’m a victim of racism!
6617,"But that's exactly what you are advocating - that if one is not surrounded by other races, one will turn racist?"
6618,Or is it that only people in Singapore will turn racist if their schools dont reflect the ethnic proportions of the country?
6619,"But that's ignorance, not racism."
6620,But that's true regardless if it's an expat or local.
6621,That the racists are militia.
6622,But the couple was going all out to milk the racism card
6623,"> Respondents were however least satisfied with the opening of Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with other countries, with only half saying they were satisfied in W41 (10 – 17 November 2021) to W42 (19 – 23 November 2021) (Figure 1.1.5)."
6624,Around 26 per cent in W41 (10 – 17 November 2021) and 22 per cent in W42 (19 – 23 November 2021) felt neutral about the opening of VTLs with other countries.
6625,"Most Singaporeans wont rent out to Indians for that reason alone and not so much due to racism  Edit: Wow, downvoted into oblivion for telling the truth."
6626,"So those boomer policies appear to have merely drove racist sentiment underground, not actually achieved racial harmony."
6627,"At least when people are willing to speak their mind (even if they’re racists), you get some clarity about the true state of race relations."
6628,"Also, “social repercussions” would just bury her racist thoughts, not change them."
6629,"Getting scolded/repercussion doesn’t teach someone, they’ll just learn to not be blatantly racist/xenophobic."
6630,Some might reinforce their beliefs and be more racist (e.g.
6631,"But then how do you draw the line between what is just outright racism and a ""joke""."
6632,"But these expats are not here to serve the Singapore market, we're not a manufacturing economy, we're more a service based economy, these companies are here to serve clients from all over the world or region and not Singapore."
6633,But they don’t allow fact to get in the way of some casual xenophobia.
6634,But this distortion of the word leads to more negative tensions and ill-feelings among us Singaporeans in a climate that's already tense due to legitimate racist acts lately.
6635,"But this isn't some random person posting on Facebook, its actually a known community activist for foreign workers."
6636,But this post is about racism against Singaporean Indians.
6637,And people are using it as an opportunity to be racist against one of us!
6638,"Minding your own business, work, have lunch, have dinner, spend time with your loved ones, don't do anything racist."
6639,Then ONE sad motherfucker decides to be racist - BAM!!!
6640,But we all say that pledge in school last time so there can't be racism
6641,"But we don't have a mutual VTL with Indonesia, though."
6642,"People from Indonesia are allowed to enter Singapore without quarantine once the VTL starts, but Singapore residents can't enter Indonesia without quarantine."
6643,"But we're not turning every picture in the world into racism my dear, we're only saying your one picture making fun of the slant eyed physical characteristic of asians is well, racist."
6644,The only reason you would want to see a breakdown is because you’re racist.
6645,They’re usually thinking of so called “CECA” expats from India (yes I know it’s factually wrong since not many come in under CECA but that’s what they think)
6646,But why assign maid to take care someone with dementia?
6647,"But why can't the maid ""run away""?"
6648,Help me understand this - are maid employers taking the position that they have a right to force a maid to continue to work for them even if she doesn't want to anymore?
6649,So why do maid employers feel that they have a right to force their maid to stay with them?
6650,"So they're still hiding their racism, in a sense."
6651,It's not like in-your-face racism like in OP's example.
6652,"I've not seen that many cases of direct, in-your-face racism here, which is why this is surprising to me."
6653,"Second, wages that are considered a windfall for foreign workers are simply not enough for the local populace to subsist on."
6654,But wouldn't it be the humane thing to treat foreign workers like you would want to be treated.
6655,"You have got expatriate workers, you have got Malaysian workers."
6656,Nowhere in this Paper is it spelt out what will be the fate of the balances of expatriate and Malaysian guest workers.
6657,"If that is permissible for expatriate workers, why should it not be permissible for your own workers?"
6658,I think the broader issue when it comes to attracting foreign talent is integration (or lack thereof) with the host country.
6659,How to serve the foreign talents then?
6660,"Buts that's the whole point of foreign workers, so dunnid to have any low wage jobs for Singaporeans at all."
6661,Buy through DG of WHO to declare emergency but not impose travel restrictions (contradictory btw).
6662,By automatically assuming that there’ll be escalation is racist.
6663,"By definition, It's racism.."
6664,By far the most onerous part of my VTL experience was post arrival at Changi
6665,"By humanoids who've never had to live on such a deal, plus pay maid levies, plus send money to family back home, I'm sure."
6666,"By siaolang, I refer to aggressive, unreasonable behaviour on this platform that masquerades as “calling out racism”."
6667,Good luck to those posters if they are really keen on advancing the cause of eliminating racism.
6668,Thus all the hoo-haas with CECA and what not.
6669,"By using Malaysia as example, suddenly racism in Singapore doesn’t feel so bad anymore."
6670,By your logic the brownface incident was also not racist.
6671,"By your logic those ""really is not racist"" replies may also not be Chinese, cos who knows right?"
6672,Tldr; Expats realizes the transient nature of expats.
6673,CECA Foreign workforce has never been about economics.
6674,CECA beneficiary eh?
6675,CECA does not allow more Indians into Singapore but removes red tape when doing business and reduce tariffs.
6676,So CECA is to encourage business dealings NOT migration  Edit: this is coming from someone who does not like PAP one bit
6677,CECA does not alter immigration requirements.
6678,"What you are talking about has to do with the government's immigration requirements, which is independent of CECA."
6679,CECA has been around since 2005.
6680,"Furthermore, the number of foreign workers actually [fell sharply](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/unemployment-jobs-sharpest-fall-singapore-mom-14417666?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna) last year, which doesn't support your false insinuation that CECA is responsible for increased unemployment of Singaporeans."
6681,CECA here   CECA there   CECA everywhere
6682,"CECA is a trade agreement, not a racist slur."
6683,CECA is not an immigration policy and as such there is no such thing as a CECA Indian.
6684,"If you are specifically referring to ICT clause/provision under CECA, CECA ICTs made up 500 out of 4000 ICTs in 2020."
6685,CECA is the most visible manifestation of the current backlash against mass economic migration.
6686,CECA is to Singapore like TPP was to America
6687,CECA started in 2002.
6688,"After almost 2 decades of gaslighting the citizens, then the government start talking about CECA and providing information."
6689,"CECA, PRC, pinoi or Bangla."
6690,CMIO is the base formula and you would fall under “others”.
6691,CMIOP!
6692,"I wish there was a system to enable ""stay-out"" maids (vs live-in), but sadly there is none."
6693,"If this was possible, I would get a maid in a heartbeat."
6694,"My wife and I jointly decided not to have maids, partially not to spoil the kids, but also many issues with having live in maids."
6695,"Stay-out maids would solve so many problems, as this prevents employers from taking for granted that the maids can work 24x7."
6696,"One day, I think, if the problems get so bad, gahmen should enforce stay-out maids."
6697,"This will drive up the cost of maids for sure, but weed out the cheapskate employers who would be more likely to abuse their maids (not saying all lower income folks are abusive by the way)."

6822,Cause OP has a friend who apparently gets more for being expat so it must be a widespread opinion
6823,Cause my social circle earns above the median income by a far bit and no one complains about FT and CECA.
6824,Rather let long term migrant workers and Malaysians/Indonesians get it than Haodilao Dyson owners.
6825,"Unless Singapore is going to go full China and implement the Great Singawall, the government will be hard-pressed to go checking every forum for xenophobia and racism."

6838,"However, by and large most FDW, when they return to their home countries do not regret choosing to come here to work."
6839,The poor conditions many FDW face back home should perhaps instead make us think twice about intervening uneccessarily in a mutually beneficial relationship between employers and FDW.
6840,"In return for a few years of domestic work, with some restrictions on their freedom, many FDW are able to lift themselves out of poverty and lead a much better life when they return home."
6841,Imagine if we mandated zero inteference in the lives of FDWs.

6847,Cheap fares on VTL as people panic!
6848,"Many in society have been trying to address it for a long time and the government has repeatedly refused to listen and kept banging on the drum of we must stay open, we don’t have options, your kids will become maids in other countries, retrain to compete, advertised jobs for retraining are security guards for the young."

6851,The maid insurance.

6853,"Singaporeans aren't allowed to meet their friends, so why should maids be allowed this too?"
6854,I daresay the vast majority of expats can't be bothered to explore our heartlands (especially the mature HDB estates).
6855,"Trying out the various duck stalls islandwide probably isn't the first thing in the minds of your typical expat - heck, they would choose sandwiches over hawker food when working in the CBD - but maybe give that a shot before concluding that SG is dead boring."

6884,"PA should definitely refute the racism claim, my point is that the way it is worded doesn't come across as working with the couple to reach an understanding, but drawing an even deeper line in the sand."

6907,"Similarly expats do still want to work here, just that it’s though right now."
6908,Companies aren't going to have them on expat packages unless they're at a minimal level...

6920,Condemning racism isn’t ‘wokeness’ but ok
6921,What about all the expats leaving in large numbers that reddit has been warning about...  > But there's the risk the prices will go up even further...
6922,It could be a simple matter such as condo informing the residents that the cost of utilities paid for by the condo was getting higher so they were thinking of raising the conservancy charges so they came up with a daft idea such as this to  be implemented or even just a disgruntled resident having got to wait for their turn at the showering facility while a maid showered.

6930,"Congrats, like I mention before the first step to stop being racist is to acknowledge that we are racist."
6931,"For every one of you, I can tell you there are 10x expats < 39 who have been excluded from the latest round of vaccinations, currently wondering why tf they should stick it out in a country that obviously doesn't give a shit about them (beyond their tax dollars and whatever they're circulating in the economy)."

6933,There are a bunch of toxic xenophobic people but hope you don't get offended by them
6934,"Even in America, racist people like him will face the same consequences."
6935,This simple comic sums it up what freedom of speech actually means in America: [https://xkcd.com/1357/](https://xkcd.com/1357/)  Cases of racist Americans facing consequences:  [NJ Teacher Suspended and Under Investigation for Cursing at Black Students While Calling George Floyd a 'Criminal'](https://www.theroot.com/nj-teacher-suspended-and-under-investigation-for-cursin-1846804457)  [Florida KK-Karen Arrested for Hurling Whopper and Racial Slurs at Burger King Employee](https://www.theroot.com/florida-kk-karen-arrested-for-hurling-whopper-and-racia-1846828061)  [‘Yeah and I’m a Racist’: Ohio Man Evicted and Charged With Hate Crime After Threatening to Kill Black Woman](https://www.theroot.com/yeah-and-i-m-a-racist-ohio-man-evicted-and-charged-w-1846780007)
6936,"Because Japanese xenophobia, although more subtle, is far worse and these people literally get funnelled into these lives outside the mainstream."
6937,"Considered from the other comments here about if you want to go back to UK and jab there it will be 3 months (81days), I think the best solution might be waiting for Thailand to be on VTL or quarantine at dedicated facility for 10 days."
6938,"If Thailand is recognised as a VTL, the vaccine certificate will be accepted in Singapore too as if you were jab by sinopharm, sg will recognise that vaccine as it’s on the WHO emergency use list."
6939,---  There's a difference between endearing caricatures and racism.
6940,"Mixing them up is what causes actual racism to take root, because one side now sees the other not being able to take a joke, and the other now sees this side as oppression instead of light-hearted jokes."
6941,"Considering a move to Singapore as there are great opportunities there for my industry, but I've heard the expat/foreigner community tends to be older and more established (e.g."
6942,"Considering how racist and McDonald's loving y'all are not surprised., you're just like your murcan masters rofl"
6943,"Considering our low unemployment rate and high median wages, expats aren't displacing locals."
6944,The fact is that America has a smaller share of foreign workers than Singapore.
6945,"Considering that I work with a lot of expats who are happy to migrate here to work (vs China or India or Malaysia), I find it strange that in the recent thread about someone being caned for breaking the law (you know which one), people on other subs seem to think our laws are barbaric, we're evil and xenophobic and this place is I quote ""a shithole of a country""."
6946,Would be nice to get a mix of expat and local views.
6947,"Considering the other flavourful text he threw in his post like the constant mentioning of God and the like, he's not just racist but high on grandpa's cough syrup as well."
6948,"Rather than using taxpayers money, the firms employing foreign workers should fund this."
6949,Hence no one wants to work in this industry and foreign talents have conquered this industry already .
6950,Construction workers are expats now?
6951,"Data source remarks aside, note that a very large proportion of ""immigrants"", both low-wage workers and highly-skilled talent, are Malaysian, who are neither straightforwardly foreign or local due to a close historical association with Singapore - the Singapore Ministry of Manpower and the ICA do not disclose their exact criteria, but it is known that they do take nationality/ethnicity into account to affect the composition of immigrants."
6952,"&#x200B;  [Something doesn't \\""match\\"" already, this guy didnt have the balls to say what](https://preview.redd.it/7kdvlmdyaz851.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=516bf46a119426014b63d4d944dfc3d78fe02e6e)  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/sq7otes9bz851.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eb9ff86f76d6b1ce41ac793f7ad3eb40c123205  &#x200B;  [I hate to resort to reasoning with racists, but im desperate](https://preview.redd.it/ra6ghntebz851.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6f3103bf728c9bd63dd11b599bead53090e7b20)  &#x200B;  [Boo hoo, the landlord earning 2.5k per month for years had to spend a few hundred dollar to spruce up his place, what difference does it make if the tenant was indian or white or chinese?"
6953,This is why I distinguished between making jokes between friends and just attempting to make racist jokes at people who will not understand you.
6954,Remember when the govt tried to build worker dorms closer to residential areas and so many racist boomers freaked out?
6955,"He is making a comparison between two different situations, and adding his qualitative view that people beating minorities up in the UK, is as bad as how we treat our foreign workers as an underclass of menial laborers."
6956,u/skatyboy is talking about racism as non-Chinese Singaporean.
6957,"The OP is making a point about racism towards foreign workers, Chinese PRCs, and Indian foreign workers."
6958,foreign workers?)
6959,If you’ve ever been to Australia you will know first hand how simple Chinese greetings can be derogatory or racist depending on the tone and intonation of how it is spoken.
6960,Asians in Australia are very much subject to racism in their everyday lives (there are plenty of news articles about Singaporean Uni students being insulted and attacked for their ethnicity)  If it’s ignorance or a genuine attempt to understand another’s culture I think simple greetings are fine.
6961,"But in a society where casual racism exist and phrases like “ni hao ma” are often used as mocking taunts, I think it’s better to be more sensitive to not internalise the same kind of casual racism in any speech as well."
6962,"I think part of conversation of which people have around the SAP is that , structurally it provides a path for people whose mother tongue is Chinese to have an accelerated path to success; and yes its through their own hardwork."
6963,"Controversial sub opinion, feel free to down vote as needed (I'm alright for karma)  A good way to limit this impact is to just allow, for the period of this pandemic and a severe border closure, WP holders in Singapore to get WP in different industries regardless of nationality."
6964,But we should make mother tongue optional.
6965,Tbh mother tongue is pretty meh.
6966,Maybe have a watered down level 1 mother tongue as an option.
6967,"Conversely, it sometimes feels like the government is careful not to be seen as treating our migrant workers too well, for fear of voter backlash who feel the resources could be better spent on them."
6968,"Cool story bro, you also experienced racism."
6969,"/s  Now, the point was SG ~~was~~ is a country of racist landlords plus some politicians and still burying one's head in sand refusing to acknowledging the problem."
6970,Although I won't weep if their racist words come back and bite them in the arse.
6971,"Copy and pasted from the article “Mdm Sujeewa then obtained an S pass, an employment pass given by the authorities to mid-level workers, and began working full time at Yuen’s clinic, where she has been ever since.”"
6972,The issue is that the foreign workers are not better because of their innate talents or education.
6973,"S’poreans refuse to sit next to a migrant workers in MTR, accept Indians as tenants and asks maid food to be prepared separately from theirs."
6974,Cos LKY was the most high profile racist in Singapore and we all must treat LKY with respect.
6975,Cos the OP is racist lah.
6976,Never experienced any racism before so easy for them to say.
6977,"Cost of living is higher if you choose to live like an expat and eat at restaurants, down a lot of alcohol etc."
6978,"From what I observe most of the foreign talent here have families living back home in their home countries, they only pay for a single room in a sublet flat/condo (usually flat) and they send most of their money back."
6979,Could be VTL flights don't have transit passengers (who don't need pre departure tests or be vaccinated) while non VTL flights might have?
6980,Could it also be companies cutting back on / letting go expats to save cost?
6981,Like I get that it’s racist and vile but I doubt the fucker votes in Singapore or can kill me lol
6982,"Could it be that terrorists organizations are targeting specific groups of people in this case, maids to commit terrorists acts ?"
6983,Could it be the fact that our local workforce are not suited for certain jobs and hence companies needing to look for expats?
6984,"I don’t see many Singaporeans wanting to do “low paying” jobs like construction, nursing; but when expats are hired to fill “high paying” jobs they make a huge fuss."
6985,I'm perfectly fine with foreign workers (even their dependents) being in the workforce **if we can accomodate them**.
6986,Could you explain how you consider stereotyping by race as different from racism?
6987,"- They state the topic (many comments on r/sg are racist) - they provide an example (the thread + comment) - they explain why this example is, in their opinion, racist - they go back to the topic and elaborate a bit - they clarify that opposition to immigration is fine, but *sometimes* arguments used against immigration do veer into racist territory - they preempt the possibility of them being downvoted (which, admittedly, is generally not looked upon favourably on reddit)  >Edit: Addressing the actual post, OP doesn’t seem like someone that has any noticeable or prolonged interactions with India indians."
6988,"- I understand that people might have had negative interactions with ""India Indians""/North Indians etc**, but discriminating against an ethnicity based on some negative experiences with people of that ethnicity is... literally racism."
6989,Opposing racism... really isn't much of a high horse.
6990,As an Indian expat of ~9 years I’ve always borderline felt the opposite and the same goes for most other Indian expats that I know with people going out to their way to try and fit in or understand the local culture.
6991,Could you spend as much energy pushing back on the racists on the other threads I’m on instead of splitting hairs on a flair?
6992,The segregation of workers is also a weird one as expats from wealthy countries are treated differently to kakaks and construction workers (many of who I have interacted with do not have access to their passports).
6993,"Or if you are triggered by your racist joke spewing friends, why not take it up to them specifically, rather than overgeneralising local participation in the movement?"
6994,"Case in point, know a few expats who wanted their kids to go to local schools but couldn't get placements."
6995,Casual racism.
6996,"Country like Taiwan only allow domestic helper for providing care-giving to elderly and in many countries,  you do not see a helper being part of a family for years."
6997,On a race based immigration policy.
6998,Courage and good vibes to all facing the effects of racism everyday.
6999,Covering maids under the Employment Act like every other human employee in Singapore would be a good start...
7000,"In contrast, much of the PAP's message is built on implicit threats (""we need a strong mandate to continue fighting Covid-19"", ""don't be taken in by false promises"", ""do you want to lose good ministers and Singapore's stable political standing and your jobs and home values and have our women become maids in other countries???"")."
7001,Criticize Suhdir's point on EIP == racist o\_O ok lor lol
7002,"Culpable homicide at the last part of the report is either life imprisonment or 20 years minimum, but the maid only gets 15?"
7003,Cultural ignorance and even theft is not racism.
7004,If there was no apology then I would think it is racism.
7005,"To get closer to a state of racial harmony, this distortion of the meaning of racism has to go."
7006,Imagine viewing every little thing that affects u as racism.
7007,"Curious about the racism you encountered, care to share?"
7008,As an Indian expat whose been here for some time the experience has been the exact opposite ie expats from all over who’ve been here working and contributing for years are having issues with their EP renewal revoked etc and are pretty scared.
7009,In part it was assumed to be because practices had moved away from retaining/taking on expats to ensure more local hires.
7010,I have an expat friend who also earned 7 digits annually sometimes 8 digits.
7011,Curious what travel insurance to get if I want to VTL to Korea?
7012,Current narrative seems to be ‘no racism in public spheres please!’  How about we talk about how actually to weed out racism and change mindsets instead of just letting it fester behind closed doors till they explode into another such episode?
7013,"There's no need for VTLs, there's no need for quarantines at all, there's not that much need for PCR testing arrivals."
7014,"VTLs are not a step forward, they are an illusion of progress which actually gets in the way of adopting a sensible approach to travellers."
7015,"Sometimes you can get a good company to work for, and in Singapore (where most Western companies will treat it as an outpost) you'll get pretty good colleagues (because you're small and crap people are found out quickly), varied travel possibilities (can get boring when on a plane 3/4 weeks), cultural diversity (as an expat especially, but see the bit about the travel) and usually exposure to many additional roles within the company that need to get done, but they don't have a budget or need for full time staff here so you're just chucked the ball and asked to run it."
7016,"Currently studying in Australia and I'm confident this level of racism doesn't exist anymore, or at least, doesn't exist in big cities."
7017,"Currently the government is managing to house, feed, provide masks/sanitizer for the foreign workers presumably from the Ministries' Budgets and assistance is also given to Employers for salary payments."
7018,Currently trying to buy VTL tickets from end Dec to early Jan. Idk much about US air ticket prices since I've never been there...
7019,After all the racism thrown at Christians and muslim.
7020,"Currently, you can get Singaporean 'maids' for 4k/month that work 40 hour weeks."
7021,90% of the people employing maids now probably won't be able to/willing to pay that much.
7022,Cuz u AREEE the maid
7023,"No idea how expat healthcare works, but I'm guessing you'd just have to get private insurance; basically like US healthcare but at least the hospitals aren't quite as expensive."
7024,"It's an expensive city for expats, a lot of what makes it liveable on a middle-class or lower salary are government subsidies you won't enjoy, so keep that in mind when comparing wages."
7025,"To me, the lady just wanna blow this up and stoke racial tension, this is not even a racist incident why categories as such?"
7026,"My opinion: it is ACCEPTABLE for the public to discuss/mock/praise any public figure and their actions (such as publishing a pictorial and call it a book) and personal life (already plastered all over internet at that time)  HOWEVER It is NOT ACCEPTABLE to be racist, call for others to harass Nicole etc."
7027,Him and lots of other expats are leaving at the end of this year (when their current project ends).
7028,Literally we are imposing 21 days quarantine for high risk countries now so how the fuck is saying “virus take more than 14 days to appear” is racist???
7029,Damn scary to let a maid take care of your BABY.
7030,Why should tax payers pay for what the dormitory operators should have been doing in the first place?!
7031,"Damn, it does feel good to know that another racist is in jail."
7032,"Sadly it won’t fix her racist mindset, but hopefully the jail term at least makes her keep it to herself from now on."
7033,"Damn, just so damn racist and xenophobic."
7034,"Damn, me with my head under a huge rock, not realizing that we have already solved racism."
7035,"I've heard some shocking words from closet racists/bigots too, some of whom I worked with for years."
7036,"If you are so concerned about the national language's impact, then go off at the young malays who fail their mother tongue."
7037,"Please give me examples here of that racism, instead of trying to hide behind acting like your life is so miserable because of this racism."
7038,I hear a good share of this racism from the minority groups.
7039,"Oh yeah before you type anything, first please search up the definition of racism just to be sure, and don't confuse it with stereotypes, or preferences/impressions."
7040,"Examples that doesn't have to be racism -> ""Chinese small eyes"" -> ""Malay people lazy"" -> ""Cannot see indian at night""."
7041,Asians have always been racist and regionalist.
7042,Dat subtle racism
7043,Both racism and anti-racism requires data.
7044,"Everyone speaks English here btw, so you don't need to learn an ounce of [local language], all immigrants welcome!"")"
7045,"Dayung Sampan seems to be a song about rowing a sampan from China to Singapore, but I was wondering, was there a significant amount of Chinese immigrants who actually did that?"
7046,"( some might say it's a good thing)   All this is traded for a safe environment to live in, with moderately peaceful politics, and relatively less racism if you are not Caucasian or Chinese."
7047,"Money is not as good as Shanghai, despite what locals think about expats being paid a lot more."
7048,I am very interested to know what expats consider as alternative countries to working in Singapore.
7049,How's the Singaporeans sentiment when it comes to PRs (permanent residents) and FTs (foreign talents)?
7050,"As someone who feels extremely strongly about the rights of foreign domestic workers, I am very glad and heartened to know that many Singaporeans are FOR the rights & respect for foreign domestic workers."
7051,"Personally, I feel the problem stems from many Singaporeans not having enough empathy, and believing that they have the right to do as they please to the domestic helper since they pay her."
7052,And that really breaks my heart- to know that a country that has prospered and progressed in almost every way yet stayed behind and backward in terms of our treatment towards foreign workers & our attitude towards them.
7053,"I hope to, in the future, help FDWs in our society."
7054,"However, in the mean time, if anyone has any volunteer opportunities about helping FDWs or just educating the general public about how we should treat and respect FDWs, do let me know."
7055,"Dear Redditporeans, I see so much press these days complaining that PAP is hiring way too many foreign talents - going so far as to say that this  A) Implies the Singaporean Education systems sucks B) The Government should just hire locals."
7056,"The reason Singapore has so much foreign talent is because Singapore is successful; and to remain successful, it *must* keep hiring Foreign Talent."
7057,Of course it needs foreign talent.
7058,Please don't fall into the xenophobic rhetoric and stupid sites like Thehearttruth and screw Singapore up.
7059,"To be clear, this is not another exercise in xenophobia or racism as seemingly and unfortunately prevalent these days — this is merely to illustrate the numbers at play here."
7060,"Dear SG Redditors,  Thank you for the helpful suggestions and positive responses to my previous post, ""Will a group dedicated to monitoring travel restrictions & news be helpful for people who are keen to travel again.?"""
7061,But I think that consensual sex with an FDW should be legally discouraged.
7062,I say this as having been an employer to FDWs and realising how vulnerable they must be.
7063,"Dear all,   The last time I posted on r/Singapore, I wrote in defiance of maid abuse, and in defence of my maid, Elina."
7064,"Of course, this does not directly prevent the issue of maid abuse."
7065,"However, many of the families in our neighbourhood do employ maids, and sometimes face issues when communicating or interacting with them."
7066,"We can share good practices and tips, and work to help each other treat our maids better and create better homes."
7067,The resolution to this one conflict does not discount the fact that maid abuse does happen in Singapore.
7068,"I'm a male Chinese myself, but I was pretty shocked by how casually racist my peers were."
7069,A unified language would enable all and sundry to stomp this misbegotten racist down as and when needed.
7070,"To me, even one in five maids getting abused is considered common, given how serious maid abuse is."
7071,Definitely agree that VTLs have to go.
7072,"In a recent trip, the VTL flight cost 40% more than the regular despite leaving only 1 hour apart and using the same model of aircraft."
7073,"Don't get me wrong, racism is still racism, and that's inexcusable, but in this case, it sorta feels like we are picking on someone who definitely isn't mentally stable."
7074,"There's a saying around the domestic worker community that ""they see but they remain silent."""
7075,"She KNEW she had a case, even innocence is not enough, many domestic workers would plead guilty anyway."
7076,Definitely not racist.
7077,The Japanese who are racists are the same archetype as Singaporean who are xenophobic and racists.
7078,So many rich immigrants were given citizenship and prior to covid didn't live here.
7079,"Singaporeans can't even accept the GST hike positively, why would they accept prices to be increased to help the migrant workers?"
7080,I personally wouldn't bother (and i doubt that guy would bother if he didn't have a maid or a blogpost to write).
7081,"Definition of expatriate is ”a person who lives outside their native country""."
7082,"Safe/Racism - Don't worry, compared to SG or Asian, many western countries are not racist but a small % of folks who'd show it openly."
7083,But some foreign domestic worker's living quarters is simply a storeroom or extra space in the kitchen (especially those living in HDBs) while they are served the family's scraps for meals.
7084,"If we consider the power dynamics of an employer and foreign domestic worker, that blurs the line even more."
7085,Some employers task their foreign domestic worker to do extra work that they are NOT allowed to in their work permit.
7086,"Sure they can evoke their rights, but which foreign domestic worker will, when there is a risk to be penalised."
7087,"So if the employer chooses to not give a rest day and instead pay a salary, the foreign domestic worker is working 7 days a week."
7088,Denying someone something on the basis of skin color is not racism?
7089,It seems that the strategy for landlords in a flagging economy faced with no expats coming in is to raise rents by 25-30%.
7090,"But yeah, they are discriminated - however you can see above that my point on Japanese xenophobia is not that it does not exist."
7091,Defining people by their race is racist.
7092,"I am thinking of selling mine unfortunately I did not land on VTL, i bought much earlier in the year now just wanna get rid without profit .If you ask me the amount of testing is just damn crazy and what is the double standard between land and air."
7093,"Depends on how you define ""mother tongue""."
7094,"""), I assume you mean ""the native language of my *perceived* ethnicity"" (the modern frequency of mixed marriages throws a very large monkey wrench into this somewhat racist view), and ""other people"" means ""everyone except family""."
7095,"\+++++  That said, my personal definition of ""mother tongue"" is ""the common language of your *elder relatives*"", i.e."
7096,There is an undeniable advantage if they have members who have good command of their mother tongue.
7097,"Of course SC don't need to worry about getting the VTL pass, can just return."
7098,Non VTL for non-SCs like E pass holders requires the re entry permission from MOM which can be inconsistent in how easy/fast it is.
7099,Wealthy expats make the news for all the wrong reasons.
7100,"Singapore Air was charging $1000 more for a VTL flight, whereas it turns out all of United’s flights to SG are VTL by default."
7101,"I've been in an MNC for 5 years here as an expat, and even applying for internal transfers in the same company is a massive task right now."
7102,My family hired a dew different maid over the years usually around $800 ~ $1000/month.
7103,"Usually after daily expenses for food ($200/week for the children and maid $50 each, they have to include their own food expense) water and electricity usually range around $450."
7104,"Edit: one more thing, the issue of their work permit/employment pass equivalents."
7105,"Human being human, yes there will be racism and discrimination, as in everywhere in the world."
7106,"I know someone that  studied in Pasadena, live in Monterey Park and and works nearby in Alhambra and she said she didn't feel any racism."
7107,There are clearly nuances here and merely acknowledging racism or mentioning vague actions isn't enough imo.
7108,"I moved after about 2 years here, but because I'd initially applied for a job in Singapore there was no expat package - I was just paid whatever wage I was owed and had some nominal medical insurance that I'd expect from any job anywhere."
7109,Depends on what you think defines racism.
7110,If there's no racist intent it's hard to argue that it's racist.
7111,"If it's perceived as racist, that doesn't mean it's racist, because offence can be taken at anything (e.g."
7112,"people who think ""black hole"" is racist)."
7113,"If you're in a university town where there's more racial diversity, obviously you're gonna face less racism than if you're taking a holiday in a less racially diverse area."
7114,Some expats you can tell is those kind at their home country cannot find job then hop on the bandwagon and come over while others are poached by the company.
7115,But generally foreign talent are frowned upon as they take up the jobs that many singaporeans want (generally the executives and above positions)
7116,Unfortunately these migrant workers aren't likely going to be writing the history books.
7117,Depends on your definition of expat.
7118,There is a category of expats that has nothing to do with immigration - those on temporary assignments.
7119,This is why you see even lower paid expats having to pony up the cash and send their children to all the kucing kurap no name international schools that have popped up- they can't easily place their kids in the local system and the waiting list for reputable international schools like Tanglin Trust or UWC is pretty damn long even if you can afford the crazy high fees.
7120,"Like someone else said, possibly racism."
7121,Letting her off signals that its acceptable behavior because she seems well connected/expatriate and that basically theres one rule for locals and one rule for expats
7122,"But it depends on the companies and I have noticed that volunteering rates are low among working PMETs (the biggest groups I have witnessed in events are students getting CIP points and retired seniors)  To end off, I would like to say if we could improve on the 3 points above, I feel locals will be more accepting of globalisation (CECA or other FTAs) happening on our shores."
7123,Describing the employer of the maid as their ‘owner’ is probably part of the problem.
7124,"Hack, back in 2016, as much as 70% wanted an indian ethnic to be our Prime Minister https://sg.news.yahoo.com/most-singaporeans-would-choose-tharman-1523976433713206.html  Your refusals to listen and make an effort to learn about the country you are in, gives me a feeling that you are just coming here to troll and stir racist sentiment among r/sg redditor."
7125,"Despite the typo, I guess prison life would be much better than what the maid was goings though."
7126,Of course ideally we will all not be racist in our hearts without legislation.
7127,"The racist part btw isn't asking for equality, but instead bringing ethnicity/race into things."
7128,Devils advocate 2: you are the neighbour that keeps his maid under illegal working conditions and simply don't want to get reported.
7129,Or is it a strawman to prop up your racism hate-bait?
7130,You're insinuating that PA is racist and are *totally* out to insult Malays with their standees.
7131,To me it seems more like she's throwing a tantrum on the pretence that she has the moral high ground of fighting for racism.
7132,And remember their racist test papers of stereotyping?
7133,I was based in a region that had huge influx of Chinese immigrants and anti Asian sentiments were starting to soar.
7134,Did he say that this advertisement is absolutely not racist?
7135,">Also, I’m not surprised if a lot of his “friends” have internalised racism, and thus giving his line of thoughts more legitimacy."
7136,>Point of the outrage against the racist ad is to raise awareness.
7137,There are people facing against racist behaviour daily.
7138,"Sometimes it is because circumstances change leading to changes in job scope; at other times, the family situation of the FDW may change."
7139,Strange that you would nevertheless say Chinese are not becoming racist.
7140,"""I'm not racist BUT......"""
7141,Did someone call you a racist?
7142,"Just saying ""he coloured his face"" as if that in and of itself is racist, is completely absurd."
7143,Did the dormitory operators have empathy and compassion for the workers and their living conditions whilst reaping obscene profits?
7144,And the maid has already left the country.
7145,"In the case of the maid stealing, she would have needed dozens of transactions to make it off with 2000+ dollars which is harder?"

7169,You seem to suggest that a 'threshold' implies that certain forms of racism will no longer be accepted as racism.
7170,"Obviously, 'subtle, more insidious' forms of racism can still be considered to be racism, and so, by definition, falls within the threshold."
7171,You seem to suggest that racism should be defined based on the individual's experience.

7207,Do they have maids/nurses in jail to take care of such individuals?
7208,If your answer is no to all this then why are you putting them in the same bracket as work permit holders?
7209,The fact that you are conflating tourists who stay here on a short term basis with work permit holders that have stayed here for years on end shows you have no idea of the point that I am making.

7251,"That planted you firmly in the tourist/expat bubble centred on the CBD, likely being paid a multiplier of what an equivalent position would have paid in the non-silo economy available to locals."

7271,Does VTL mean people from VTL countries can travel for vacation?
7272,Does anyone else think that the VTL bullshit and mandating a certain number of SQ flights could have something to do with this?

7276,Does anyone know where they will stop issuing VTL pass from tomorrow onwards as well?
7277,Does cultural insensitivity equal racism?

7287,"She's an employee as a domestic worker after all, and doesn't deserve to be talked to in that manner."
7288,"It's clear that this lady has a lack of respect and empathy for her maid such that her attitude could change 180 degrees when talking to her, whilst behaving like an angel around her own coworkers."

7299,Doesn't that refer to residents and not the foreign workers/talent?
7300,Just doest warrantthe call for racism here.

7318,Don't get me wrong - there are plenty of racists all over the world in every country.
7319,"That said, I think it's naive to say these vocal, in your face incidents mean that racism and xenophobia are worse than in Singapore."
7320,"I'd also say that while racism isn't in your face here at all, people still have attitudes which in lots of western countries would be seen as racist."
7321,But minorities would be the only ones sick and tired of facing the same bloody racism getting rehashed over and over again every single week.
7322,But I also believe that our foreign workers deserve some support too in this crisis.
7323,"I sincerely hope that employers are putting more of that $100 into taking care of our foreign workers, but it is simply impossible to be sure that is the case."
7324,"I've noticed in the apast - in previous postings on racism in Singapore - that that person's arguments are usually ad hominem attacks, or along the lines or ""everywhere else got racist what?"""
7325,Don't get why people are comparing US's racism to Singapore's as a reason to dismiss her concerns.
7326,"As with many parts of the world, darker skinned people here tend to get the shorter end of the stick but I'd say most of the racism here are usually more err casual and everyday than overt."

7335,There are multiple incidents where Singaporean Chinese received racist treatment overseas because foreigners don't care if you are Singaporean or Mainland Chinese.
7336,Don't pay your maids or you'll be investigated for funding terrorism.
7337,So what makes maids so unrustworthy?
7338,Are maids naturally more inclinded towards theft than shopkeepers?
7339,Or is it more of a case of employers being able to get away with behaviour that we otherwise find unconscionable because they don't see maids as fully deserving the same basic rights as other human beings?

7350,Minorities know racism when they see it and this ain't it
7351,The guy you were replying to is one of those racists spouting rubbish out of his ass.

7355,VTL.
7356,"Don’t be afraid, these racists are not worth talking space in your brain because if always afraid then they win."

7369,Don’t know why would people think calling them China Lady is being racist.

7380,"Singapore created this tri-furcated labor market with SG/expats, WP/S, then MW and FDW essentially indentured servants."
7381,"Dormitory, catering, $900 per foreign worker levy monthly"
7382,There are people who need maid out of convenience and then there are those who need the help.
7383,"They are already calling a spade a spade, that his actions were racist."
7384,The maid will then be blacklisted and probably owe a sum of money to the agency as they usually take on loans to come and work in Singapore.
7385,"Doubt the 6.9 million policy will change, long ago Singaporean already kpkb about ""prc"" flooding in Singapore, then Filipino then now India foreign talents."
7386,Down time without maid is the biggest consideration .
7387,There’s literally no savings to be maid when employers let maid transfer right now so why would any employer obliged.
7388,Only reason why they would let maid transfer prematurely is only when they are promised another maid immediately
7389,He was clearly not talking about 300k migrant workers swarming hospitals for worried well testing.
7390,"At the same time, Singapore treated expats and SC/PR differently, not allowing expats to return to the country unless their employer applies via MOM for a specific return slot."
7391,Dude I'd go to a concert and listen to a band I hated right now just to experience a change of scenery... sadly the only way to do this is to use the VTL to get the fuck out of Singapore.

7397,](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/22/us/kendi-book-anti-racist-blake/index.html) You think this is the opinion every anti-racist holds?
7398,Dude you got no idea what CECA entails and just sprouting bullshit lmao
7399,"Dude your original comment literally said ""seems like recently people will associate racism with every single fuck thing""   what does that supposed to mean?"

7408,The non racist people who are the majority probably won't even bother putting a comment in.
7409,"Dude, this isn't just seen with how people treat their maids."
7410,>You can say it's common that people use this shit or whatever in order to downplay the non-violent racism or whatever but why are you lumping me with them?

7416,Fuck you for trivializing racism.
7417,Due to fly back to SG in two weeks but now looking to move my flight to next week due to fears of the VTLs being cancelled or something.
7418,"Dunnid to even bring death in, this is actually the 2nd accident; [another one in February](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/several-hurt-in-pie-crash-between-lorry-and-bus) involving lorries transporting migrant workers that I've read this year."

7425,(Singaporeans have this really skewed mindset as to how they direct their racism towards other races.
7426,"Like ""Oh wait, I'm only racist to foreign talent who come and steal our jobs because that's the acceptable kind of racism""."
7427,"that marc jacobs girl is the only one I can think of, and even being the face of Marc Jacobs isn't enough for some of these modelling agencies who have told her ""your skin not light enough"")   The problem with racism in this isn't the fact that it's blatant, it's internalised and deep rooted in the way we treat people."
7428,"Racism is okay towards PRC/Foreign Talent unless they are doing jobs that we don't want, like being construction workers/maids/cleaners/sweepers."
7429,"And you know that if America pulls this, it's xenophobia."

7432,"Since my post has been blown out of proportion I would like to use this medium to push out some links ( that have been so kindly shared with me by other Redditors ) so we can start putting all of our words to action by supporting these causes, or make a conscious effort to call out racism in our daily lives."

7434,The place where all things xenophobic happen.
7435,"Highest salaried expats are on EP, then S-Pass, then Work Permit."
7436,Assuming that those expats are hired in on that scheme.
7437,Remember the employment pass in principle approval letter that was signed by both you and your employer?
7438,"When EP min pay is increased to 3.9k, you speak as if we are closing off to all foreign talents and paint a doomsday."
7439,There are really 2 singapores: residents and foreign workers.
7440,Don’t think there was any intention to test whether Chinese women or men are more or less racist.

7442,I told the man that it was uncalled for and racist but he proceeded to call me rude since I was much younger than him and that he had a son that could beat me up.
7443,Easier to throw a maid in jail than address the real issue at hand
7444,Must be why those work permit holder headcount declined the most as compared to other passes
7445,Easy for employers to send maid to Changi Airport during any random early morning.
7446,Difficult to detect maids being tortured to death.
7447,Easy to frame the racism angle when you add Chinese to the picture.
7448,Easy to not be triggered when you don’t face racism lol
7449,"Then people can always complain and say this is implied racism as ""strong smelling spices"" typically target a specific race."
7450,"Also abolish slavery in Singapore, no more maids unless in extreme situations."
7451,"It is about treating domestic helpers as equal human beings, as opposed to treating them as if they're lesser beings."
7452,Eating humble pie and admitting you are a racist are not mutually exclusive.
7453,In fact it requires humility to admit that you've held onto racist ideas and were blind to them.
7454,"If you plan to travel during this period (VTL or otherwise), be prepared to adapt for evolving circumstances."
7455,Many countries have reintroduced travel restrictions and we are nowhere near HK’s extreme measures.
7456,Economic immigrants being entitled.
7457,"Edit1: FYI, I didn't come in through CECA fyi."
7458,But you didnt have to get butthurt by a small wording mistake in a post that was clearly not meant to be racist you idiot.
7459,"Home Affairs Minister and Attorney General Shanmugam noted that he used to believe that Singapore has been moving in the right direction in terms of racial tolerance and harmony, but after seeing some of the recent incidents involving racism, he is no longer so sure."
7460,The fact that our political leaders have taken these racist acts seriously reflects the importance we attach to the issue of ethnicity.
7461,"This is not a problem unique to Singapore; apart from homogeneous or mono-ethnic societies, multiracial societies face the same challenges, especially immigrant societies."
7462,"Some people have taken the ""Critical Race Theory"" that actually promotes the new racism of white hatred in the United States and parroted it locally, changing the concepts used to discriminate against whites, such as ""white privilege,"" into ""white privilege."
7463,Educate yourselves...be better humans..not simply brush off racism and claim its worst in other countries..why not be decent humans instead?
7464,No FDW is forced into the contract.
7465,"You meet someone, fall in love, want to have a family as a maid?"
7466,The most basic of maids salary is about $500.
7467,So... it’s really more racism than anything.
7468,How come this makcik who never give you enough sayur lodeh is racist.
7469,Definitely not racist.
7470,"Eh deh, where is the East Coast plan before saying stuff like committed to open VTL?"

7472,Eh how much must you earn per month in order to be called an expat rather than a foreign worker ah?
7473,Eh i assume the employer has canceled the work permit which makes her an illegal immigrant unless she has a valid work permit?
7474,"One comment called the family ""knn"", another one ""dark times are here"" how the fuck are those not xenophobic and racist?"
7475,We had a maid who became really chummy with us and gained my parents trust the 2 years she worked for us such that my parents felt it was safe enough to leave us alone with her at home while they worked.
7476,Imagine my mum's shock when she came home one day in the afternoon and found our maid's boyfriend whom we didn't know existed in our house with my little brother who was just 2 at that time.
7477,"Then again, I don't have experience dealing with domestic helpers so maybe I'm missing something."
7478,Make it a call to action for people to educate themselves on issues of discrimination and anti-racism in Singapore.
7479,"Lastly, while I don't think anti-black racism should be top of the pile in terms of race issues in Singapore (honest fact is that we don't have enough of a substantial population for it to matter a lot), anti-black racism TOTALLY exists here."
7480,"In a world that's becoming increasingly globalised, we are seeing that passive ignorance explode into a racism thats much more violent and ugly when contact is made."
7481,"Eh, I don't find it racist; I think it's too troublesome to include every single ethnicity in Singapore (that would probably need a list of at least a few hundred)."
7482,> The new healthcare system for migrant workers follows the roll out of regional medical centres for workers since Aug 28 last year.
7483,"Not to give Jo Teo any credit, but it seems like it was COVID rather than Tan See Leng that set things into motion at MOM for migrant workers."
7484,"You say my comparison is not right, so if preferring to date a certain gender is not sexist, then preferring to date a certain race is not racist, right?"
7485,But you say racial preference is the very definition of racism.
7486,So is it racist or not racist?
7487,"Our relationship is tangled up with class, nationalism, longing for the home, clash of culture and xenophobia"
7488,"I was actually in China as an expat before, and yeah, it was wasn't bad."
7489,"If you (usually irrationally) dislike a group of foreigners, you're xenophobic."
7490,"By that measure, I'd say that Singaporeans in general have become increasingly so in the past few years - likely coinciding with the influx of foreign talent and the relatively poor-er economy."
7491,"Ehh but VTL is about JP->SG, not SG->JP right.. meaning to holiday there we're at the mercy of their government"
7492,The govt gets a lot of backlash for letting in so many indian and chinese immigrants.
7493,"Yes, a lot of racism in SG is casual, but it is *also* systemic (race-based immigration ceilings for people that aren't ethnically Chinese, SAP schools), widely tolerated (nobody bats an eyelid when Indians are denied accommodation) and deeply ingrained."
7494,"or ""no cost, but possible upside"" or ""man, this is annoying but whatever"", but rather ""fuck, this is just going to get worse for brown folks because BLM reinforces their false notions of (post-racism and equality in SG""."
7495,of institutional or casual racism across countries because the truth is that they will never understand.
7496,"Anyways, racial preferences are pretty common and natural to have though overtly mega racist folks tend to be a smaller subset of the overal young sg population i reckon."
7497,"you may face racism when trying to rent a flat (no Indians basically), but there's a lot of SJW exaggeration as well."
7498,The maid is a worker here and we should extend our hospitality to her.
7499,This is what I think will happen when maid supply decline
7500,S pass holder not in dorms 2.
7501,"Also, this is just straight up anti-Indian rhetoric now and no one is even pretending there isn’t racism involved - but I guess that’s just something his audience is completely okay with."
7502,There is a part in the video where the millennias said that saying a malay wedding is noisy is racist but hesitated when it comes to the chinese thingy they hesitated for moment then state that it is racist too.
7503,The asian jews and lazy malay is definitely racist.
7504,"Employer also very fed up with neighbours smoking and keeps talking about supporting 大力ban smoking, maid don't understand why employer supports taliban smoking  Translation:大力 (dali) forcefully"
7505,Employer should take some time off from work and follow his own demands of the maid for a week or 2.
7506,Employers by law cannot keep the FDW's passport.
7507,"Employers cannot 'safekeep' maids' salaries, just as the rest of us would not accept it if our employers were to 'safekeep' our salaries."
7508,"Employers having sex with their FDW cannot be fully consensual as long as one is in such a postion of power over the other, ala Harvey Weinstein"
7509,"End of expats in Singapore, nope."
7510,"We will still hire expats, just that we or rather the government is more picky on who can come in on EP."
7511,The employer is inviting a complete stranger in and the maid is living with a bunch of strangers.
7512,I'm sure there are employers who trust their maids enough to have bfs but that doesn't happen overnight
7513,I've just gotten my employment pass settled (gone through the blood tests etc) - but still the issuance of the physical card would take 1 week or so.
7514,"All the profit that comes from transporting workers like this goes to the firm, while most the risks are borne by the workers, who get deported when they get injured and cannot work anymore."
7515,Why is it xenophobic to expect immigrants to be proficient in it?
7516,"Fortunately, our government is relaxing our mandatory mother tongue policy and starting to do things like teaching Chinese as a foreign language."
7517,A lot of the past destructiveness of the mother tongue policy came from the fact that 80% of students in the 90s would not go to university and the mother tongue was often an effective veto factor for them.
7518,The point is that we should not get the government to force people or listen to people who wantonly fearmonger about the mother tongue issue.
7519,Enough of casual racism
7520,Are you so racist to think Singaporeans are naturally untalented?
7521,"Not least of all that it’s gonna be even harder for the younger generation to find jobs if the MMTF keeps flip-flopping its way through restrictions/“not a heightened alert” and MNCs/foreign companies decide not to invest in us, simply cause expats don’t really want to work and live here anymore."
7522,"no need to do SHN thus no VTL anw, and they don’t even need to be vaxxed to enter SG so…."
7523,Meaning the maid provided the false document in Singapore which she did.
7524,Unless you saying the maid surrendered her passport to the employer overseas which won't make sense cause she only can surrender the document within Singapore
7525,"Er who has actually said ""minorities cannot be racist""?"
7526,There is also not real proof that the person who designed the ad was intentionally racist.
7527,"Erm, did you follow that recent maid case against the CAG and his son or some shit."
7528,The maid being told to clean elsewhere and all that?
7529,I don’t hear any of this from the foreign workers I’m in contact with.
7530,You do realise how grossly racist what she said was right?
7531,"In my comment about listening, I'm talking about the minority racial voices and the racism issue here."
7532,"And anyways lets be clear..expats or no, these restrictions are crazy for everyone."
7533,Not all maids have the luxury of choice.
7534,FFS casual racism or not this is happening on a daily basis.
7535,If you have to dig this deep to find racism.....
7536,"There is nuance between Charlie Hebdo's satire and this person's racist mocking and even if you were to feel this is a distinction without a difference, neither justifies violence."

7539,"There are dormitory operators, and since the outbreak there have been stepped up efforts to remedy what went wrong."
7540,"“Singapore is now, more than ever, divided into two cities, two populations: the foreign workers in dormitories, and the rest of us."
7541,"Errr, you think Singapore is not an environment with ""real racism""?"
7542,Errr... the Brad Bowyer guy from PSP is an immigrant who is married to a 'native' Singaporean and he supports reviewing CECA.
7543,"They are not anti-immigrant but rather support a tightening of immigration which can affect social cohesion, an idea that was supported by LKY himself in 1982 (https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/singapore/netizen-asks-what-happened-to-lee-kuan-yews-vision-of-a-“wholly-singaporean-workforce”/ar-BB13WAad)."
7544,"Lots of FDW are quite young, no birth certificate so can lie about age and all."
7545,And after the sentence the maid confirm perma blacklist from working in Singapore.
7546,"If the maid got money then confirm can appeal for shorter sentence, but the way our system works."
7547,Experiences racism from all angles.
7548,It could also be because your gf and I had to deal with enough subtle or non-subtle racist shit for our entire lives.
7549,I recently experienced racism on the MRT as well.
7550,I thought I was overthinking it but my (Chinese) friend was already staring daggers at the guy and told me that she also noticed he was being racist.
7551,The community also seems to be one of the worse sources of hate in Europe - far outweighing the racism from the far-right; there have been many incidents against Israelis and Non-Muslim Indians:  > http://www.thelocal.de/20160421/sikh-temple-bomb-attack-salafists-arrested-police  > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Birmingham_riots  > http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/263925/how-muslims-europe-treat-non-muslim-migrants-hugh-fitzgerald  > http://www.amazon.com/Anti-Jewish-Riots-Oslo-Eirik-Eiglad/dp/8293064005  Singapore is actually a **role-model** in how to selectively choose migrants from certain key countries in order to avoid the troubles that we're seeing in Europe.
7552,"The country categorically does not accept asylum seekers en masse in the same manner Europe does, and the city also has country-specific requirements for allowing certain migrants in key areas:  > http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/eligibility-and-requirements/fdw-eligibility  This is fairly similar to what the United States has been doing in relation to its Islamophobic immigration policy, and it's also what Europe should adopt in order to reduce the harm that's being inflicted in Europe's citizens."
7553,I hope the **minimum** that we get from *the left-wing* after the next election is an immigration policy similar to Singapore and an end to the affirmative action - the right-wing should be far more strict.
7554,European countries don't shut the door to avoid guilt - they don't believe having a maid is a necessity in the same way people here do.
7555,Even BBC reported the an increase of racism towards Chinese has bolstered support for the CCP
7556,"Even Janil is a closet racist with his statement  Raising a hypothetical situation in which a SAP school offered Malay, he said that in such a situation, a handful of Malay students would apply to that school."
7557,"And thats a fact, whenever anyone brings up racism the instant response is defensive and stating other countries are worse."
7558,That’s too much effort for such a petty racist move.
7559,We could be talking about racism in schools that need to be addressed but instead there’s someone upset about their waffles 😫
7560,"Bonus: writer's thesaurus game is really strong, we have a CMSAE model now  >""citizens of the diverse country’s Chinese, Malay, South Asian, and expatriate communities can coexist in peace and prosperity"""
7561,Even funnier is that the maids probably provided more value to Singapore than him.
7562,The real problem is when the domestic helper is not aware of the laws and don't know how to report to get their employer in trouble.
7563,"Also, another factor is that they're generally in debt to agencies (maid agency fees are often exploitative and unregulated) and so have to keep on working rather than make trouble."
7564,"I dunno lah I just feel like it's so embarrassing Singaporeans actually think we have good laws for maids when we (like HK, Dubai and Qatar) are literally globally famous for the opposite."
7565,And after so many maid abuse or death cases - people really are in denial
7566,"Even if it was not a desirable posting the average person who is able to land a job internationally, as an expat, is on average above average in any country on the world in terms of education or experience."
7567,Even if it's performative how you gonna be upset about people speaking up against any form of racism.
7568,"Also I've seen apologist racist friends use this post to try and justify their bs... You can have your opinion, mate, but my opinion is that yours is a little privileged and tone deaf, though you make some valid points."
7569,"Also on the last part, finally when asked ""do you want a Chinese nurse"", if she was truly not racist she would have said ""no, not necessarily, any nurse will do"" instead of immediately agreeing to it."
7570,"Even if that happens, the Singaporeans who've been in construction for 5 years would be experienced skilled labour, they can communicate in English, they can do calculations, they may be good at training and managing foreign workers, or they know or have ideas about how to do things more productively."
7571,"Just like a tradesman in Australia, they should be a lot more capable and command a higher salary than a fresh foreign worker."
7572,Even if there are no dorm clusters I see no reason why migrant workers don’t fall into the category of people who need tests.
7573,"Even in the press release MOM is condescending towards foreign workers, calling such employers irresponsible."
7574,Are expats and foreigners not allowed to join in on our national day celebrations too?
7575,"They certainly aren't ""illegal immigrants"" because for the most part their ""immigration"" predates the modern Burmese state, yet they've consistently been denied the right to attain citizenship."
7576,"Even if travel restrictions are imposed, there is usually a couple of days heads-up, eg France/Spain restrictions only kick in at 2359h tomorrow even though it was announced yesterday."
7577,"If PA is really committed to racial harmony, then blowing this up as ""I am not racist!"""
7578,"Even in non-covid times, senseless to not try and retain experienced domestic workers."
7579,Funny how just two years ago they were viewed as capable and stable by international business and foreign talent.
7580,"Even now as a Chinese JC student, I still see other Chinese students treating their friends of different races in a subtly or even outright racist manner."
7581,"Micro aggressions are real, and those that receive racist remarks often have to laugh it off to seem “not so sensitive”."
7582,"Even prior to the rotational testing, all dorm workers were tested by mid-Aug.  By July, 232,000 of the estimated 300,000 foreign workers who live in dormitories were tested."
7583,"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-foreign-workers-testing-completed-august-lawrence-wong-12941842   It's a monumental task testing 300,000 foreign workers in a short span and testing all of the workers at once is just not logistically possible."
7584,"Plus, our treatment of foreign workers is so bad that even Xi's approved critics, the South China Morning Post, have written at least one article attacking OUR treatment of foreign workers (since, first of all, there are actual mainlanders being mistreated, and secondly, it's free intimidation from the CCP)."
7585,"Many countries had their way of tackling the disease, but like in Malaysia, it's not like the whole country lives like our squeezy dormitory conditions, yet their daily cases are a couple of thousand by community cases alone."
7586,"Even then the ministers are going to be driven by top notch drivers, everyday migrant workers will have only have average joes driving their lorries, probably breaking a few road laws along the way."
7587,"Even though it is an unpopular policy, it is very important Singapore attracts the very best foreign talent here in order to boost our competitiveness."
7588,Attracting and hiring foreign talent is an unpopular but essential policy that has given us great returns and has help fund our numerous social policies.
7589,"Furthermore if the intent is to attract foreign talents , language proficiency should be counted as part of their talent no?"
7590,"Even when the anime craze was bigger in Singapore, most of the maid shops were pretty empty."
7591,"Very fierce competition, so I kinda feel sad for the ""maids"""
7592,"Even when we were like 10 to 12 yr old, when overseas, the parents brought the maid with us, left money with her to take us around sight see or go to an amusement park or something."
7593,One of the dormitory cleared criteria are for all of them to be tested negative.
7594,Even within asian communities abroad there exist self loathing asians that are internalized racist.
7595,"Even without CECA, you would likely still have this huge contingent of Indian nationals."
7596,"I personally don't think that's ideal, but the reality is that it would likely happen even without CECA because that's how the global labour market works."
7597,Event vendor inappropriately used wrong photo for event out of ignorance - gets attacked for being racist by whole internet.
7598,"Anyone putting the interest of foreigners ahead of its citizens is a traitor, betraying its citizens.The CECA issue is    primarily an issue of nationality/citizenship, NOT a racial issue."
7599,"They can only blame the politicians for allowing this to happen.Before the flooding of the island with CECA Indians, Singaporean Indians were doing    equally well and no one complained about it."
7600,Majority of the newer generation treats the maids pretty reasonably.
7601,"Also, I prefer not to compare the helpers with other work permit holders or just employers."
7602,Every road user who walks the pavements laid by foreign workers.
7603,Every resident who stays in four walls and a roof laid by foreign workers.
7604,Every hospital patient served by foreign workers.
7605,"Every consumer who is served by a foreign worker as a cashier, waiting staff, etc."
7606,"It's naive to think that we have not, as a society and individually, benefited from the foreign labour/immigration policy."
7607,It's representative of the angst that foreign workers feel - that these people who make the logistics of modern life work are just transparent.
7608,Families have to fork out more for domestic workers.
7609,Every set of immigrants unfortunately have to go through this phase.
7610,"Even in the US we saw German/Irish/Italian/French immigrants having their loyalty questioned, people getting triggered by German road signs/schools, immigrants actively lobbying the government to help their home country and other issues."
7611,Every single person I've seen interact with their maid has always treated them nicely and with respect (referring to those I personally know of course).
7612,Yes of course there are those that treat their maids poorly and therefore end up in the news.
7613,"casual racism, being blind to inequalities minorities face)."
7614,"And please don't say because Singapore is a ""special case""; racism is present in all societies."
7615,"When people realise that talking abt Chinese privilege =/= attacking someone for being Chinese/accusing someone of being racist, Chinese people can become more accustomed to the term and realise it describes their struggles too."
7616,Every thread on maids is the same.
7617,"Everyone in my school was ethnic Chinese so we were all extra careful not to be racist tbh (except there was still a lot of racist ""jokes"") but anyway there were also a ton of anti-CHINESE Chinese sentiments"
7618,Not everything is automatically racist.
7619,Everyone is racist to an extent.
7620,"Everyone is racist, let's not try to pretend we treat everyone equally."
7621,You are racist.
7622,I am racist.
7623,"By restrain, I don't go about acting on my racist thoughts."
7624,Everyone needs to watch this to educate themselves on the dormitory situation.
7625,Everyone says this shit but there are soon many people who still don't treat migrant workers like human beings.
7626,The way we treat and pay our foreign workers is akin to slavery.
7627,"As our wise minister once said ,  “I have not come across one migrant worker who has demanded an apology”"
7628,Everyone's a little bit racist!
7629,Everything also say racist
7630,Everything also shout racist
7631,"A non VTL also must do 7 day SHN although exact flight route (no stopover, same VTL country to SG on SQ) and same travel history and same vax status instead of an on arrival PCR"
7632,Everything is xenophobic because it's easier to dismiss it as that than have actual discussions about the matters at hand.
7633,Just call someone racist or right wing or xenophobic and instantly dismiss all their ideas and suggestions because surely no one wants to be associated with racists
7634,Everything racist.
7635,A population campaign is much easier than a racism campaign.
7636,A pros outweighing cons approach simply doesn't work for racism.
7637,"Give them some more time, especially since this racism is a problem on a smaller scale than some other things right now, like Malaysia's new government doing stuff with the water contract."
7638,Anyone who says there’s no racism in Singapore should put on a malay / Indian sounding name and photo on a Social media profile and go about commenting on the news  / on their resume and apply for jobs / on a dating profile and see how things are.
7639,I’d rather have social racism than the violence here in the US  Would I have to go to my college and do an exchange or a school over there?
7640,If under-perform can change maid?
7641,Since most of the public is there anyways...someone is bound to pick it up and share right...instead of grace fu talk about something that to me doesnt even sound like xenophobia... and if they want to exercise some rights why let grace fu talk about it....why not tell the public...how do i know that she isnt making this up as she goes along... Just like how she can point to people being xenophobic surely someone can counter that by saying another anecdotal piece of info where singaporeans helped foreigners during covid...where are the facts.
7642,Exactly and we allowed foreign maids for over 3 decades and this is one of the most common abuses.
7643,I had whiplash coming back to Changi and seeing the few hundred people employed in the VTL testing theatre.
7644,"It is human nature to not look after what is not yours  My FDW has no choice about where she lives but you better be damn sure she takes care of the room I give her, or she's getting an earful or maybe even fired, because my kids could get sick, other people she interacts with could get sick  Are we saying we want to operate dorms that way?"
7645,"- Basically, I think some form of racism is unavoidable, and the safety issue would be dependent to a certain extent on how we react to the racists when they lash out."
7646,"While I agree that some Asians do have internalised racism and some level of pinkerton syndrome, but this is not a justification for racism."
7647,"It may enable Westerners to persist in their racist thinking and behaviours, but it is not a justification."
7648,I’m a foreigner who works at an american tech firm in Singapore and I don’t think anyone is on expat packages.
7649,"Even the VP who is coming from europe will not be on an expat package, but get a local contract and will have to pay for his own housing, schooling, etc."
7650,"I remember during phase 1, I hardly saw any expats on the mrt but after it ended, I slowly see them with their families."
7651,"It's so messed up right we know for a fact based on NGO reports and interviews with maids that isolation caused by living with the family is contributory to abuse, yet our laws specifically mandate employers must choose the form of employment that is statistically the most likely to result in abuse."
7652,"We should start phasing out live-in maids, or at the very least make it not compulsory."
7653,She killed another human being and the fact that that person was her maid is irrelevant.
7654,They make it out to be less serious because she was their maid.
7655,My family member is a healthcare worker who is at the frontlines taking care of infected migrant workers!
7656,"I’ve seen the same with other expat communities, like PRC Chinese in Australia."
7657,Attacking CECA is senseless since it is *not the* *root cause* of these problems.
7658,"Exactly, i thought that was the point of VTL?"
7659,To call out exploitative behaviour with regards to FDWs while wanting NS to stay is hypocrisy.
7660,"Exactly, it's good that HSK brought up the racist views that many voters hold."
7661,"Yes, the characters are fucking stupid and two dimensional but at the end of the day that's what the masses want to watch and switch off their brains and just laugh at stupid slapstick humor and apparently racist jokes."
7662,"Like god damn, if you can afford x10 maids, at least pay her for her services!"
7663,"Exactly, opposing attempts to regulate social media because ""this won't eliminate racism"" is like saying, ""rape exists despite the harsh penalties in Singapore, so might as well decriminalise it""."
7664,Treat maid as punching bag and only 3 years in jail?
7665,"Exactly, the first one is racist."
7666,"And you can tell from the replies now and then whenever such topics comes up, some of these expats here have the ""ha if it wasn't for us, sg would have been in the shitters"" mentality."
7667,It will be interesting when VTL reopens and see if demand has softened.
7668,And the comments above said I'm xenophobic for wanting citizens to be prioritised.
7669,"Back when China treated expats like gods, these expats absolutely looooved China (""English teacher"" with zero qualifications except for being born in Anglo nations) but when the Chinese themselves started to rise and focused on building up their own people, the value of expats dropped so the lower level expats all get pissed off and started blaming all sorts of stuff on the country, the government and the people."
7670,I fully agree with the part about being racist.
7671,I agree that it was insensitive but it definitely wasnt racist.
7672,The funny thing is we chinese do actually face racism but we dont talk abt it coz some minorities will claim the racism we deal with is nth compared to theirs when racism is racism regardless.
7673,I wish people get the full experience employing one of these 'rogue maids' before perpetuating themselves online as 'human rights' trumpeters.
7674,"I mean they can get away with it because the West is such a huge landmass of countries stretching from NA to EU, you can find a sizeable white expat group anywhere in the world and live within an entirely Western bubble, but then what is the point of living in Japanese society if you're not going to interact with any of them?"
7675,it stems from racism/minority differences.
7676,"If the person really is worth it, the respective companies would be able to apply for employment passes for the both of them."
7677,Its a systemic problem and the govt should have taken preventive steps in February itself when the first migrant worker cluster was discovered!
7678,"The workers are young and healthy, so large dormitory clusters are unlikely to put strain on the healthcare system, especially with 88% boosted."
7679,"Back when community cases were close to zero, there was a valid fear of dormitory outbreaks spreading to the community, but this is no longer relevant as the virus is already spreading widely in the community."
7680,"But when it comes to rentals, Singapore allows racism to flourish unhindered"
7681,"In that case it's possible that the 2 locals make $6k, while you end up with an expat who's getting paid $10k because you can't afford to wait around for another local, who qualifies for the job, to turn up."
7682,"They chose being maid freely, so if you think being a maid is bad imagine how bad the other options, they choose being a maid over, are."
7683,"This is such a provocative headline, making it sound like most expats make this much money."
7684,"1, it's about mid level managers, not mid level expats."
7685,"Mid level managers are fairly senior people with over 15 years of experience usually  2, this tracks expat packages."
7686,"Expat packages are very rare these days, very very few expats are on expat packages."
7687,"Most people get standard base salaries with no random perks like housing and cars etc  3, by definition expat packages are only offered by rich companies and only when they are desperate to hire someone."
7688,You can't have a meaningful VTL if one side does not agree to a protocol that does not require SHN.
7689,"But NZ, Taiwan and HK do not, and hence no meaningful VTL can be established."
7690,If the foreigners face a problem with xenophobia i would like to see them march and express themselves instead of someone like grace fu talking for them.
7691,Examples were already brought up how poorly domestic helpers were treated.
7692,"Hope that the govt doesn't forget about the migrant workers as well, whose mental health would surely be affected greatly as well."
7693,Except citizens have to stay here and tank the shit while expats can easily go back to their home country or another country.
7694,"Except for half naked men, none of those complaints are justified tho, just racist."
7695,Except no one find the waffle incident as racist ?
7696,"Applying the same proportion for SG, it is 110 spots for CECA."
7697,I am sure that no one will complain about CECA if there is such a cap in place.
7698,Except there's nothing really free about the market for maids.
7699,It's regulated both by the singapore government as well as the government of the maids country.
7700,Exclusively is racist.
7701,Not exclusive not racist
7702,"Excuse me, it's not that we won't apologize, but not a single migrant worker himself has demanded an apology"
7703,Now spin BS about racism and xenophobia and has the audacity to cite the Robertson Quay incident as an example.
7704,"We don't want to move back to Australia, but we have aging parents, and it's getting really hard to not be able to see them, with the quarantines and the travel restrictions on both sides."
7705,"Sure, that means the money comes from taxes, so perhaps the cost to citizens is higher than paying directly to hire a maid/helper."
7706,"Expat here, I know exactly 0 mid-level managers in my acquaintance circle of expats that make the ""average""."
7707,"It was a lot more common 10-15 years ago, but you usually find people willing to move to SG now and don't need to dangle the expat package carrot except for rare occasions"
7708,"I’m on an EP, earn local salary, and pay local expenses out of my own pocket, the same as 99% of the other expats I know living here."
7709,"Expat take here, on why many expat friends are leaving this summer."
7710,What are the personal health insurance and term insurance options that are available to expats in Singapore ?
7711,"Expats tend to mix with expats, locals tend to mix with locals."
7712,Expecting me to conform to certain ideologies and actions *specifically because of my race* is racism.
7713,"Oh, I'm not racist, it's just differences in ideology!"""
7714,"Expensive; pathologically don't-you-*dare*-admit-you-notice-it's-racist; with stagnant wages for everyone not working in a rich industry silo; with a Potemkin-village version of democracy masking a hereditary kleptocratic autarchy; yes, Singapore has something for everyone."
7715,Experienced a ton of racism during army as well.
7716,"But hey, “majorities cannot experience acts of racism” and the moment you speak up it becomes a dick-measuring contest."
7717,Explain to me how I can possibly prove you are wrong if you insist that treating domestic helpers or others as 2nd class people is acceptable.
7718,Explain to me where I said we should treat domestic helpers or others as 2nd class people?
7719,You are exposing that you treat workers and maids as 2nd class people.
7720,Being denied employment opportunities because of racial characteristics seems pretty racist to me
7721,Explicit racial policies and quotas normalize racism in society and make minorities more protective of their cultures rather than emphasizing integration and tolerance.
7722,We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers.
7723,"Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers."
7724,"FDW are not allowed to drive for work, per MOM."
7725,"FDW is practically expat, but right now is more like a label for 3rd class citizen."
7726,"FDW: Foreign Domestic Workers, aka maid  Non-maid, non-construction, there are so many more, cleaning?"
7727,"FDWs are particularly vulnerable to abuse in a way that non-FDWs  are not, because of the nature of their work, the way the system is set up that disempowers them relative to employers."
7728,"We should and must work towards both - protection of local and foreign workers, which includes FDW."
7729,"FDWs are supposed to have days off under the law, they can refuse to the day off whenever they want and employers will still have to pay them under the law."
7730,"You can do what you want to safeguard yourself, but if I have to be called xenophobic or over-reactive by telling my mum to avoid crowded places and to wear a mask wherever she goes, or to tell my dad to reject picking up any passengers that may be in China recently, I would gladly do just that."
7731,"This is a clear case of a foreign national (ironically from one with apartheid-esque laws, talk about rampant and explicit racism) attempting to stir discord into local politics, MHA should FICA, revoke her PR and deport her."
7732,I can only imagine the number of domestic helpers who are going through this right now without a voice.
7733,WP \~ 1mil which includes FDW of .25mil & construction .
7734,At this point you have 350k foreign workers in Construction Maritime and Processing alone.
7735,"FYI  racism  /ˈreɪsɪz(ə)m/   noun  prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized."
7736,This is precisely why the government mandates all new FDW employers enroll in training prior to employing a helper.
7737,&#x200B;  The mindset that helpers are in someway 'different' is what results in the multiple cases of maid abuse that are seen in this country
7738,This is why the number of no-name private schools has exploded over the past decade- lower income expats can't afford the brand name international schools and can't get places in the local system.
7739,"It's not impossible, but it means you can't run extremely lean as you've got to funnel money out of the business to justify your employment pass here."
7740,"FYI, I just googled for a definition of racism: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particularly racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalised."
7741,I’m not saying shouting racism is helpful/unhelpful.
7742,(It also isn’t to scream “racist” again and again and do nothing else.)
7743,"It’s to let them know that the action is racist, so they stop doing it."
7744,Ask around the expatforums and you will see your case isn't an isolated one.
7745,Some Singaporeans are incredibly racist.
7746,Until the government recognises that there is a racism/discrimination/xenophobia issue in this place nothing will change.
7747,"I asked myself why it wasn’t a foreign worker doing the cleaning job, some strapping young fellow?"
7748,"Is it because the job is meant for someone lower down the social system, like the migrant worker?"
7749,The fact that the victim was a maid or otherwise does not matter.
7750,Fact remains is that there is an very high number of Indian foreign workers in banking and IT in Singapore.
7751,CECA is used as a convenient scapegoat because the government has yet to provide any explanation on why this is the case.
7752,"We get that foreigners are required to fill gaps in our workforce, but the high numbers of foreign workers made locals worry about their own job security."
7753,"This is an important discussion to have, because government policy on foreign workers will always have an impact on the local population."
7754,"Sadly in threads like this, racists will also take the opportunity to spout nonsense while contributing little to constructive discussion."
7755,Fair enough - so there’s a racist pass for dating due to its personal nature.
7756,"Fair enough to point out they could be domestic helpers, I assumed they were other male foreign workers from the usual Bangladesh/India/China/ASEAN."
7757,"Facing the transportation issue for migrant workers is but just a small step in the fight against our over-reliance on exploitative labour, and providing safer transport is not going to magically solve all their woes."
7758,"Technically these aren't institutionalised racism, but there is little that can be legally done to force such companies to drop their discriminatory hiring practices, unless you can prove without a doubt that they did not hire you because of your race alone."
7759,"I will happily concede that I was mistaken in claiming that ""*xenophobia*"" has been endemic to Singapore since 1959."
7760,"Fair enough, but it doesn’t make sense that we have VTL with The Netherlands, France and Spain, but then exclude Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal."
7761,"But at the same time to be fair, you need people to build your infrastructures, foreign companies to bring investments, expats to rent the condos and so on, so in your country immigrants are a resource in a win-win scenario, you don't need to take care of them providing food and a roof on their head and all the other costs coming from taking care of N-thousand people without a single cent in their pockets."
7762,One of them being that racism is a natural condition of society.
7763,"For me, this is contentious and worth debating over because it provides an excuse to shrug our shoulders and carry on 'business-as-usual' with the mentality that the marginalised in our society should not be championed for because hey, they're probably racist too."
7764,And then you wonder why expats are paid so much.
7765,But you sounded like you're implying that the engineering faculty is racist in general.
7766,"I have rarely seen people who are honest-to-god racist (except for my grandma who hates Jews)  However, in the case of MediaCorp, I doubt their intention was to be racist and was purely a mistake on their part"
7767,"Germany has 13 million immigrants, that's \~15% of its population, and they all get their fair treatment."
7768,"Unlike regular immigrants, if we don't let them work, they're still here."
7769,"They become economic dead weights in Singapore (bad), force us to pay more to foreign talent (bad), make us look xenophobic (bad), drive companies to divert $$$ overseas for remote work (bad)."
7770,"After the first wave, CCP decides to run with the narrative that the virus was imported and incite xenophobia and racism."
7771,They come because Aingapore has low taxes and regulations and they allow companies to hire immigrants.
7772,"Much as I don’t like to admit it, xenophobia just fans the flame of fear even more."
7773,"Despite some misgivings of the foreign workers here, I fully support the approach taken by the SG gov for vaccination prioritisation."
7774,My family had to move back to Singapore because my parents were being harassed because of racism and are too old for that shit.
7775,Should just keep VTLs open.
7776,Feel so sorry for those maids getting abused....
7777,Poof 5 days later VTL is established for US
7778,"Almost no expats put their kids in public schools because they have rock bottom priority, you can live in Changi and get told the only available slot is in Tuas Ulu Primary."
7779,Sad for the domestic helper to have been put on the receiving end of that.
7780,"Few days back, some Redditors asked me to explain why I felt there was systemic racism when minorities apply for jobs."
7781,"Sometimes, its not that all jobs require mandarins speaking folks..its clearly racism."
7782,3) Obviously people won't be happy if prices go up but a little bit of bitching versus like 300k local jobs in construction or at least basic dignity for our migrant workers hmm wonder which matters more
7783,"Hence, I think it is important to keep in mind that a lot of Chinese (or wherever they're from really) immigrants are just like your grandmother."
7784,It's the other expats that come here for the highly sought after jobs.
7785,"I can file a complaint if I am made to work more than 72 OT hours a month, on top of 12 hours a day - so about 16 hours a day everyday - but maids can't at all because there are no maximum working hours for them) 2) I am legally allowed to rent or own my own living quarters to go home to."
7786,Okay lah Singapore No 1 for maid welfare
7787,"Fighting against racism is a only pretense, when in fact they are just finding excuses to be racist against Chinese people."
7788,The disgraceful treatment of migrant workers will go completely unacknowledged due to it being inconvenit for every political narrative.
7789,And this attitude is not only shown in the way some Singaporeans blame the government for ill treating the migrant workers.
7790,"Every single time any race related thread pops up, there are always so many damn people concern trolling about how the reserved presidency is racist and discriminatory (against the majority non-malays)  You undermine legitimate racial discrimination concerns in Singapore by concern trolling about things that aren't even racist at all"
7791,"This is unlike the air VTL where you need to take an on-arrival PCR test, and then take designated transport back to your home to isolate till the results are released."
7792,"For land VTL, you can straightaway head out after clearing customs."
7793,Finally.. Scrapped this VTL.
7794,Find me one person here or in the article that claimed he was not a racist.
7795,The word racist is even used in the headline of the ST article FFS.
7796,"When I took the MOM test before hiring a maid, it was clearly stated that helpers are not allowed to stand on a stool or chair near the window and that the height of their hips must not be higher than the window sill regardless of any activity."
7797,"Will you and many other Redditors now call this survey ""racist""?"
7798,"Got possessed by something maybe ,🤣🤣(touch wood)  Also to those who say I'm racist and xeno ect."
7799,Idk that's racist too?
7800,First generation immigrant.
7801,First generation immigrants can never assimilate.
7802,"First its Singaporeans not being keen on political activism, now its ""Im not racist I have Indian friends""."
7803,First job was in a family biz who housed all the foreign workers (20-30+) in the company's building.
7804,First lesson as an expat in Singapore.
7805,"I think you will be so frustrated of the weather that explicit racism (which is rare), home sickness and other issues will be not a priority."
7806,This kind of vague one sentence post is just going to get a lot of accusations of xenophobia which doesn't help your query.
7807,"Your concern that foreigners(in this case here the GC) shouldn't be hired to police us isn't xenophobic, *unless you are declaring here that you harbour ill feelings or hatred towards them for providing security*."
7808,"First of all, even if it is a racist, it is not related to Chinese/non Chinese issue which she is trying to stir here."
7809,"Right now, comparing Singapore and our migrant workers home country, they're better off here since they get paid, get fed, get well taken care of."
7810,"What happens when someone does not practice Islam and does not speak the Malay language (or in this case, Bahasa Indonesia) as their mother tongue?"
7811,"First of all, still racist even if that is true."
7812,"First of all, very sorry to hear your experience with racism."
7813,As a Chinese person I've almost never had to put up with all this and frankly we don't really understand how it's really like to be faced with racism unless we go and live in a place where we become the minority.
7814,So first of all there is definitely a correlation between racism and one's level of education.
7815,People there generally were not racist at all.
7816,I never heard any casual racist remarks being thrown around ever.
7817,"Fast forward to unit life, I was assigned to a unit where the majority around me were from ITE or poly, with only 2-3 'JC kids', and all of a sudden it became very natural to throw racist slurs around on a daily basis."
7818,"Well, maybe not just racist slurs."
7819,"Now regarding cinema/ads, I'm not sure I see that in a racist light."
7820,"So at the end of the day, racism sucks, but looking on the bright side, the younger, more educated people are generally much less racist, and even those who appear racist may not be as mean as they appear to be."
7821,"We can hope that things change for the better but change takes time so for the time being, I advise minorities to try not to actively look for how they are subject to racism in every aspect of life because the mind sees whatever it wants to and it just fuels more hate against each other."
7822,"And yes, there is racism."
7823,What is imported racism?
7824,You assume that all racist occurrences is imported from our experiences in other countries?
7825,Why are you implying singapore racism issues are not real enough to be addressed?
7826,"If you wanna talk about classism, racism comes hand in hand with classism in Singapore context."
7827,"Think a lot of the 'racism' is actually just a fear of the unknown, and fear of being displaced in their place of birth/comfort."
7828,"If we're talking about highly skilled and highly specific jobs, then maybe it's true that companies need to offer something for those expats with the matching criteria to come to Singapore."
7829,"Also there's this according to this recruiting firm, I'm sure they know much more about all of this than some of your friends:  http://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/commentary/expat-versus-local-salaries-in-singapore"
7830,Doesn't it feel like subtle racism?
7831,"First off, the term ""maid"", used by many even in this thread, has the connotation of servant."
7832,"Switching common use of that term to ""domestic helper"" could be the first step."
7833,"Tbh, the ""I'm paying your salary so I own you"" mentality extends beyond domestic helpers."
7834,--immigrant.
7835,"Secondly, I see in other forums, FB comments - the same people who are giving her flak for her response, are sometimes the same people who make noise when we house the recovering foreign workers on Cruise ship - etc."
7836,"But 2nd one is a factual statement regarding current racist attitudes, not an endorsement of racism."
7837,Edit: I put in more details here https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/n9s451/singapore_will_fail_if_racism_and_xenophobia_take/gxq0z4e/
7838,"First they came for the Foreign workers, and I did not speak out  \--Because I was not a foreign worker."
7839,The fact that you're bringing this up for no reason just because of his race is racism.
7840,"We are far from their levels of racism, but **racism exists still."
7841,"** I am not here to argue about a Chinese getting less meat from nasi padang stalls, or racist jokes targeted at Indians etc."
7842,Even if the maid took out a loan.
7843,"We did, the government just blatantly ignored us because they wanted to appear noble and ""not racist and xenophobic""."
7844,"First, given that we are discussing racism, it is important to point out that such stereotyping and generalisations - ""Why is it that Singaporeans are more keen in understanding Japanese or Korean culture, but seem ignorant about Malay or Indian cultures?"
7845,- could be viewed as racist.
7846,"Sure, it is possible that ignorance stems from racist beliefs."
7847,"However, the original comment suggested that ignorance **must** be due to racism."
7848,"Nonetheless, I do disagree with (but can understand) your conclusion that PA went out of their way to assume Sarah was accusing PA of racism."
7849,"On the contrary, having looked at the sources you've provided, while it is certainly possible to interpret Sarah's statements as not containing accusations of racism by PA, the alternative, that Sarah is accusing PA of racism, seems much more probable."
7850,"&#x200B;  >It's not even entirely clear to me that the original poster is referring to this particular incident when they talk about ""perpetua\[ting\] the racist culture"", they could just as easily have been referring to ""ignorance"" generally."
7851,"This quote to ""perpetuating the racist culture"" could be viewed as tenuous."
7852,"The previous sentence by the OP starts with ""This whole thread"", referring specifically to Bagharib's post specifically on the PA incident, and then, in the same sentence, refers to ""conditioned racism"", I think it is very reasonable to assume that the OP is linking the PA incident with racism."
7853,"&#x200B;  >""in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents which have been filmed)""."
7854,"This is, at best, an indirect (and possibly unintentional) allusion to the incident being ""racist"", and imo certainly doesn't on its own warrant the response she got from the PA.  Based on her wording, I think it is reasonable to assume that Bagharib considers this incident to be a racist attack/ incident."
7855,"Sure, she didn't explicitly link the incident to racism, but most people would assume she's saying that the incident is an example of a racist attack/ incident."
7856,"&#x200B;  >In any case, it's quite clear to me that she's not accusing anyone of racism, but of failing to notice racism."
7857,Bagharib is suggesting that 'there's nothing wrong with this \[unclear what this is referring to\]' because people are 'blind to racism at play'.
7858,I would interpret this as suggesting that there has been some consequence ('this') because a racist event has occurred and people did not notice.
7859,"This is, albeit indirectly, still suggesting that the event is racist."
7860,Going through a layer of indirection does not mean that Bagharib is no longer claiming racism.
7861,"Again, I appreciate your dedication to dig out these sources, but having seen these sources for myself, I have to disagree that Bagharib did not intend to accuse the PA of racism."
7862,"Second,as I’ve mentioned several times, there’s already resources allocated towards the welfare of migrant workers mistreated by errant employers."
7863,"From ST: “As of tuesday, prevalence of positive coronavirus cases in the community was 0.022 per cent, but it was 0.056 per cent among the 664,000 workers not living in dorms, and 2.2 per cent among the 323,000 foreign workers staying in dorms, which means 7,127 workers in dorms have the coronavirus.”  Are you saying ALL the workers in dorms are living in squalor?"

7866,"First, you falsely accuse me being a racist,  Then you’re doing word kung fu saying I’m deflecting la, take spotlight away la,   I was explaining the root problem."
7867,"Yes its true, there are a sizeable group of racists in Singapore, that we know."
7868,"But its even more painful to admit that the greater majority are insensitive to the racism, the hate, the discrimination and the unfair treatment that our minority friends have faced for so long."
7869,"Everyone faces it to some extent but your saying “every now and then.”  Secondly when the Chinese  minister both past and doesn’t have said questionable racist stuff it almost gives, especially older Chinese folk, licence to say whatever."
7870,C’mon bro/ sis gov here pretend we have a multicultural system without racism and this shit and the shit of the last few months still pops up  Secondly I use NS as en example where we have many national identifiers that bind us as Singaporeans.
7871,"But yes i agree that our racism towards the bangladeshis, fillipinos and mainland chinese is far worse than what we have within the 4 majority races."
7872,"Don't worry about the immigration policy protest, definitely won't be affecting you."
7873,"There are also a lot of japanese expats, circles in singapore so if you need help you wouldn't have to go far."
7874,"Firstly, I am not accusing anyone in this thread of racist behaviour."
7875,"However, when applied in this fashion it is fundamentally racist whatever the reason."
7876,"Simply by saying one (positive or negative) behaviour is down to one race, and therefore the actions to be expected and mitigated against, is the definition of racism."
7877,"By stating a limitation on race, the landlord is condoning a racist practice."
7878,The request in another Redditors reply earlier for Malaysian Female because of safety and weekend availability etc is also a racist practice and can be managed differently by leasing the property Monday - Friday.
7879,Segregating services by race is racist and backwards.

7885,"Unfortunately I don't really have a link for a good group (being an expat myself... somewhere else away from Singapore), but I'm aware of a few photography groups, both amateur and a little more professional."

7897,"For a country that prides itself for its ‘racial harmony,’ our discussions and responses to dialogue on racism are strangely inconsistent."
7898,"Time and time again, we have heard many accounts from people that clearly demonstrate racism has always persisted in Singaporean society."
7899,There seems to be a misconception that there is a certain ‘threshold’ that actions and words have to meet in order to be considered firmly as racism.
7900,As if the line between what is ‘racist’ and not is set in stone.
7901,"This dangerously ignores more subtle, and arguably more insidious, forms of racism – whether it is discriminatory attitudes in the workplace or school under the guise of procedure, or in throwaway or backhanded comments."
7902,"The policing of what is categorically racist (and what is not) shows: one, an inability to conceptualise nuance; and two, an unwillingness to listen to those that are subjected to it."
7903,"When defending occurrences that are not so clear-cut, a common counter-argument that is raised is that no individual can know of all cultural details and knowledge, so actions stemmed from ignorance may be insensitive, but not racist."
7904,Downplaying and rejecting incidences as not-racist-enough perpetuates a harmful cycle of selective deafness.
7905,For a second I thought you and your upvoters must be racist.
7906,Then I took a quick look at your posts and your anti LGBT nonsense and I realized you're racist AND stupid.
7907,"For a second, I thought Singaporeans are most proud about our low scores for press freedom and treatment of migrant workers."
7908,However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.
7909,The foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building.

7975,"But for those of us on either side who have not seen our families for almost 2 years due to the travel restrictions, this is a hugely welcome development (not least because the HK govt keeps flip flopping, just this week they increased quarantine from 7 to 14 days - if y’all think SG govt is bad, HK’s is infinitely worse because they literally have zero long term plan to get out of the pandemic.)"
7976,"You can see the economic arguments already put out (MP Irene Ng is definitely worth a read); and some xenophobic undertones (see the Nee Soon MPs speeches - tldr we feel safer without them around)  We're rehearsing the same arguments again, but hopefully something moves further this time."
7977,"Of course, there are the exceptions where the child had learnt racism from their families too."
7978,"For your first point, I think you've deviated from the kind of foreign workers that is being discussed."

7980,"Every dollar of disposable income earned here is worth much more to the foreign worker in terms of personal welfare, family contributions, child raising and retirement planning, than it is to the Singaporean, even if the foreigner is paid at a substantially lower rate."
7981,"The Singaporean worker suffers this one huge disadvantage, because unlike the foreign worker, they cannot accumulate their income to spend in low cost areas."

7991,Foreign workers aren't expats though
7992,"If I were a foreign worker, I'd definitely count my blessings to be in Singapore!"
7993,"Far be it for me to say that ""Singaporeans don't know how good they have it"", a common refrain among entitled expats who think they know better."

8005,But you could go on the counter-argument that Singaporeans are apprehensive about having  migrant workers too close to home.
8006,"A lot of things have to be done gradually and over time, since it would be terrible if a pandemic, or some issue happened within migrant workers' cramped living spaces."
8007,"Even if let's say, this was not politically feasible, international agencies and news agencies warning about the humanitarian crisis of stuffing 20k workers in 2 dorms should have raised an alarm, or the early cases of migrant worker infections causing a cross-infection across different dorms and working areas like construction sites."
8008,"I only mentioned the migrant workers' issue, and did not touch on the implementation of CB, MTI's delays on approving businesses for working in CB, mask management, job security and so on."
8009,"I mean most expats come here renting baller condos paying 4k and upwards a month, i’m personally renting with my bf and we are paying less than that for a 1BR condo which totally suits us as we do not need a huge 3BR apartment with too much space to fill :)   like the rest has said, you’re better off renting as  1. you can’t buy an HDB as a non local and all other little policy related restrictions."
8010,Frankly my mother was kinda racist but it didn't affect my views much thankfully because I went to non-SAP schools.
8011,How many people around you cared about the foreign workers before covid?
8012,The foreign workers are not some stray cat living in your void deck.

8027,"From another article: For a start, up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers living in dorms that have had no Covid-19 cases in the previous two weeks will be allowed to visit pre-identified locations in the community for up to six hours each week."
8028,Up to 500 out of how many migrant workers we have?
8029,While a lot of racism here is ‘benevolent’ (e.g.
8030,"From comments like stating they are PRCs to comments saying we let too many foreigners into Singapore, I can’t help but feel there’s some element of xenophobia at play here."

8033,"(I even have one friend who wants to voluntarily do NS)  On the other hand you have what I consider the ""Ang Moh crowd"" who only hang out and socialize with their fellow expats and have little to know Singaporean friends, the only ones they do have are the ones who have lived or grown up outside of Singapore and have only recently came back."
8034,"From her side of the story (though the whatsapp is kind of both sides), the maid overstepped her boundaries."
8035,"From my experience as a Caucasian/Chinese Singaporean, this ""self-image as a multi-racial society and a country of immigrants"" is more of the Chinese majority tolerating everybody else."
8036,There's a fuck lot of subtle racism that happens all the time.
8037,"From my experience in school at least, racial harmony day is a celebration of our past triumphs over racial conflict and does nothing to address the racism that's still alive and kicking in Singapore today."
8038,From my experience it's usually the women who have higher standards and give more problems to FDW......  Something something sudden 'power' they have.
8039,I’ve heard relatives and acquaintances who complain that the maid “eats a lot” - thats cos she’s working all the time!

8045,"I agree that shunning them or treating them as lesser isn't the way, as it devalues the contribution of domestic helpers in the home."
8046,"It's blatantly obvious, yet most of us chose to turn a blind eye to it - because it's become a norm that maids/foreign workers are treated that way."
8047,"I remember this incident where my cousin, let's call her cousin 1, (in her 20s) commented on her brother's (my cousin, cousin 2) family maid being unable to choose what she wanted for her meal when they were eating outside."
8048,"That said, cousin 2 is a really polite and pleasant person and definitely not the kind to abuse maids, so I'm pretty sure the norm is to just get something for the maid."
8049,"Besides, the meal he got for his maid was a pretty expensive one, so no problem with that."
8050,But I still stood on cousin 1's side; is it really difficult to treat our maids like our friends?
8051,"I suspect that there is a need for establishing an non-official form of hierarchy, so that the maid doesn't ""climb over his head""."
8052,"So I'm not arguing about this, but I would have done things very differently if I hired a maid."
8053,"Everyone is doing it, this is how maids should be treated."
8054,"All other maids are like that, right?"
8055,"Anyway, I really empathise with the maids and foreign workers in Singapore - stems from the fact that they are doing something most of us would never want to do, for a low wage none of us would ever accept."
8056,So it's not racist in my eyes.
8057,I arrived at around 7am local time in Changi and there were (I think) 3 VTL flights at the same time.
8058,"From some of the west POV, if you are not a liberal, you are automatically a fascist racist."
8059,"From the MOH reports I get a sense that we are moving towards widespread testing for our migrant workers, which resulted in thousands of **mild or asymptomatic** cases being detected."
8060,"trade-off of an extended CB with economy, need to focus on migrant workers, causing public alarm if cases surge."
8061,"From the Ministry of Manpower's FAQ:  >**Who is responsible for the costs of the FDW's entry approval charges, including COVID-19 tests, transport and SHN accommodation, as applicable?"
8062,:  **Employers must bear the costs in full and are not allowed to pass on any cost to their FDWs.

8084,From the article it sounds like a clear cut case of racism.
8085,"From the article, seems like India has benefited way more than Sg from CECA"
8086,"Local hire and expat are pretty much the same (the most generous an expat gets now is school for kids, since it's just so expensive here)."
8087,Most expats are managers or highly skilled.
8088,From the first paragraph of the article: needs to bring in foreign talent in areas including software programming while the country re-balances its education system to meet future demands
8089,"It also remains extremely hard for expats living in Singapore to see their families, and overall there's no reason for a country like Italy to give Singapore any special treatment."
8090,"From the sounds of the comments, she's a hardass teacher who is overly strict and nobody likes her teaching/disciplinary actions, but she isn't (confirmed to be) a racist hardass teacher who is overly strict and nobody likes her teaching/disciplinary actions"
8091,From the video description:  >Features interviews with mothers children and their maids from Singapore.
8092,"Through a series of questions and answers,  it shows that domestic workers understand their employers' children better than their employers."
8093,"This film, which calls on employers to allow domestic workers \[\****off?\**** *there seems to be a missing word here\]* every week,  informs mothers about their maid rights in this way."
8094,Instead of advocating off day every week for domestic helpers.
8095,Almost pitting mothers against domestic helpers.
8096,I hope the domestic helpers did not get into trouble with their employers after this video was released.
8097,"As a general statement of principle, you should stand up for something that you presume to be xenophobic and insensitive."
8098,"I agree that telling him that it was uncalled for and racist might be a good thing - but usually, telling someone that makes them defensive."
8099,"That he say ""yes, I'm a racist human being, I'm sorry""?"
8100,"To me, the point in telling these people ""that's racist"" is to tell them that their behaviour is not cool."
8101,"So - not wrong with telling him that it was racist, but I think you escalating was pointless (although not necessarily *wrong*.)"
8102,"The advantage to employers - no levy, no dormitory fees, no transportation fees."
8103,"Thai ladyboys, Filipino maids, Chinese gold diggers) too."
8104,At worst they just deal with bad attitude from some racist locals  Big difference from other countries where they are more inclined to get killed or shot at based on their skin tone
8105,"You can't really help her with your employment pass (EP), cause I think only spouses / family is allowed to be sponsored under one main EP."
8106,"From what I noticed, people who generally complain about CECA tend to be from below middle income group as they don’t have sufficient skills, expertise nor degree to get a better paying job."
8107,"From what I read, he is raising funds for the migrant workers."
8108,I expect the gap to widen as immigrants to Singapore are expected to be much more than self-sufficient.
8109,"From what I've heard in the Uk and what I've experienced here, I would say that racism in the UK is definitely worse."
8110,"Here, racists don't tend to think that Singapore is their rightful land and you're taking resources away."
8111,"In both places though, you'd find that racism is very implicit at times."
8112,"If you call someone out, they won't admit their racism and will probably gaslight you for making it all about race."
8113,"A lot of my experiences with ""obvious"" racism were from my primary school days..(basically it's from children)."
8114,Now ths racism I experienced is more implicit and it's something that only other minorities can pick up on.
8115,Would still say Singapore is one of the best places when we're talking about low levels of racism.
8116,"It's probably our history (Chinese and Indians are immigrants, and the identity of Singapore being multi racial is so embedded that even racists rarely try to dispute it)."
8117,"From what I've watched, what they're saying is that even if they are confronted with so called racist comments, none of the comments have any of the malicious undertone which they would feel in their own country."
8118,Non-Westerners who get expat packages is an exception to the rule and is reinforced by the neoimperial practices of the Western companies that operate in third-world countries.
8119,This is an actual problem while OP's FDW consensual sex problem is a maybe.
8120,You should not straight up claim it is xenophobia/racism is powering much of a discussion that isn’t outright fawning over foreigners.
8121,"Everyone knows the UK/England can be xenophobic (voted for Brexit), but it doesn’t mean the same logic should apply *everywhere* in such straightforward manner."
8122,"Frustration fuels xenophobia and racism, because those are outlets for frustration."
8123,"From your title, I thought you meant racism from classmates."
8124,"From your whole post history, really sorry to break this to you, but you are racist."
8125,Fuck AsiaOne for this shitty reporting treating the maids as simple economic tools to sustain Singaporeans' standards of living.
8126,Fuck all these maid abusers man
8127,"Fuck all you racists pricks, online will act 'omg so sorry for what you're going through'   In reality 'oh no brown person, stay away from me'"
8128,A maid is still a human being.
8129,Fuck that racist.
8130,DAE racism in SG!?!?!
8131,"https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/85hwh8/calling_all_minority_races_do_you_have_any_racist/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5q73dh/whats_the_most_racist_thing_youve_heard_in/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/56w6wx/serious_do_you_think_the_different_races_in/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3te4xl/so_lets_speak_about_racism/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6ptg15/foreigners_expats_workers_students_living_in/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/45lgsw/serious_singapore_locals_who_have_experienced/  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/67o5mk/what_is_your_view_on_racism_and_culturalism_in/  The number of times it's discussed here, you'd figure Singapore is some backwater, racist third-world country."
8132,I'm surprised expats are still here and not somwhere else.
8133,"With the spotlight now on how our foreign workers are being treated, you’d think whoever’s in charge would get their freaking act together."
8134,all kinds of racist shit.
8135,"Just like how no one gave a fuck about foreign workers in cramped dormitories then when the news broke, everyone so zai got lky foresight to say gov should have known."
8136,Some people expect to get a world-class butler service paying shit wages for their maids.
8137,Most of this abuse cases always seem to stem from people having unrealistic expectations for their maids and feeling unsatisfied when their maids don't perform up to their lofty standards.
8138,They think they hire some Filipino/Indonesian/Vietnamese/Myanmar maid they are going to get the housekeepers they see in the K-Dramas.
8139,Then they get disappointed and conclude that the maid must be lazy.
8140,Fucking stupid to not test non-VTL people upon arrival but demand testing for VTL.
8141,When it comes to racism - there can be no ifs or buts.
8142,"That many of all ages and persuasions have done so in response to Mr Tan’s racist diatribe, in a determined, yet restrained manner, represents a silver lining."
8143,"Going forward, my colleagues in the Workers’ Party and I will appeal for greater understanding and mutual respect from all, even as we work to promote efforts to eradicate the bigotry and racism that many Singaporeans - both young and old - seek to consign to history."
8144,"The current situation is not ideal, but when you look at what happens in the US (masking racism by targeting minority neighborhood) we're in a much better position."
8145,Fun fact:   >Seems like recently people will associate racism with every single fuck thing  He's quoting you from [this comment.

8147,Funniest part to me was PA using 'we were racially insensitive' and 'we are not racist' in the same sentence
8148,"Funnily enough when malay transcom NSFs stops the chinese because of their tattoes and what not they get mad and call the transcom NSFs a ""racist"" lol   Nice one la singapore"
8149,"Funnily, my family is super traditionalist but the only person around who can be considered racist is my sister."
8150,Funny enough I used to work in construction and I deal with foreign workers directly a lot.
8151,"My point in the post was two pronged: the first was that yes, we can do better for the foreign workers regardless of what their current living situation is  My second point is that the dormitories in isolation are currently blockaded by police now."
8152,I don't know if you saw the photo where a foreign worker showed that there was a large group of workers that were trying to get out and couldn't because the entrance was blocked off.
8153,"Funny how XX argues that victims of sexual assault lie, but now she’s saying she was sexually assaulted by certain “nationals”, in order to justify her racist statements."
8154,Funny how racism against majority isn't as interesting...
8155,"Could be a problem in the DH business, or just bad luck 🤷‍♂️  An interesting report on the subject  [Maid in Singapore](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2016/09/maid-singapore-160928090502296.html)"
8156,All the expats that were around me were high salary / high caliber profiles :)
8157,Funny thing is that this moron doesn't even realise 3 to 5 generations back his family  were considered foreign workers.
8158,"In that video, the two guys were arguing, but at the end of the day the interracial couple were not disadvantaged by the racist guy's opinion."
8159,Funny you got down voted but yes there was a recent article shared that gave taiwan the number one place expat.

8161,Funny you mention how your mom gave your maid permission to discipline you.
8162,"I didn't see the edit/update about your mom and maid being like bffs, or her spending time with on her off day."
8163,"So if people are calling out PRCs on their bullshit to a point where their own government is taking active steps to correct it, is it racism or cold hard truth?"
8164,Lol And pray tell how are you so confident they're tourists and not immigrants?
8165,Facilitate the issuance of visas and employment passes for ASEAN professionals and skilled labour who are engaged in cross-border trade and investment related activities.
8166,"Further to that, the main reason that CECA was signed was because India doesn't permit foreign entities to own a certain % of indian business (think it's like 26%)."
8167,"There are other things in CECA, like perhaps Singaporeans can set up businesses in India easier, there's now a lot of trade missions by IE Singapore going to India to advertise India as a destination."
8168,"Furthermore, what makes a person racist depends on their upbringing at home and in school."
8169,"Cant speak for other people’s personal lives at home, but in regards to school, I feel like despite all the racial harmony crap they teach us in specific days and events, nothing is actively done to teach kids that racism is wrong- so many grow up to have some racist prejudice."
8170,"In fact, I'm an Indian from India, which is like everyone's favourite pinata w.r.t racism and discrimination in Singapore right now."
8171,"I agree with you that racism exists in Singapore, that it isn't talked about enough, and for various social and political reasons, dialogue around race wasn't allowed to mature."
8172,"I just don't agree with you that ""ang mo"" is a racist term."
8173,Not racist though.
8174,"Don’t you know, we made it compulsory more than 10 years ago, for lorries used for transporting workers to be **fitted with canopies and side railings**."
8175,"Thereafter Singapore instead pivoted and neoliberalised extremely rapidly (beat perhaps only by Rogernomics in New Zealand), rapidly spinning off formerly state-owned industries and beginning the pro-immigration policy we know and possibly love today as the alternative answer for the tight labour market."
8176,Gahmen should do more to help 4-storey house owners get reliable maids.
8177,"They should grant $3000 for the 1st maid, and additional 10% subsidy for every storey above 3 storeys."
8178,Don't they know more storeys means need more maids?
8179,Gasp you xenophobic person!
8180,Gawd damn... that's racist af tho...
8181,You are simply xenophobic and racist.
8182,"Generally I don’t think that it’s an issue of xenophobia, but more of the fact that they compete with us for jobs, and the dilution of culture may be a concern as well   Edit: The youths are becoming increasingly open-minded but I won’t be surprised if there’s hostility from the older generation"
8183,"Minor point though, you can apply for h1b lottery every year you're in US for an immigrant visa, and there are ways to get green card after that, so the route to immigration isn't shut at all."
8184,"For example, foreign workers help our companies be more competitive/profitable but might displace jobs from Singaporeans."
8185,The term that an expat is on local terms can be misleading in most cases.
8186,"Relocation packages for incoming expats have not been removed, these are still in place."
8187,"Single pay amount approach does have challenges particularly in housing costs such as in 2008, when the property rentals nearly doubled and expats had to downsize and some left."
8188,I know of expats in the same firm being paid differently despite having similar background and it is was more to do with pay negotiations.
8189,"It's not  racism since they mostly are ok with us joining, it's just that they assume (from prev experience) the yellows want to eat together."
8190,"I'm not going to deny racist sentiments were prevalent but they never were egregious to such a degree, at least not to the extent of physical violence anyway."
8191,There clearly is a distinction to be made between one of subtle vs. overt racism.
8192,"Genuine question, why don't Chinese suffer as much racism in Singapore?"
8193,"I still see construction sites with people using the same kind of equipment, handled by the same foreign workers, transported to that location by the same nissan truck."
8194,"Is it that it's not as dangerous as we think and if we can transport NSFs in a similar way then it's fine and nothing should change, or that it *is* dangerous and both migrant workers and NSFs should have better treatment?"
8195,"Or is this about the framing of the issue, that we are not showing NSFs the same concern we show for migrant workers and that we should?"
8196,"Genuinely shocked at the amount of people in this thread trying their hardest to insist this incident was an act of racism, and even challenging the definition of the word just to call it racism."
8197,What do you even stand to gain by using racism as a blanket term for any incidents involving minorities?
8198,"If being either makes someone a racist, wouldn’t that mean EVERYONE is racist to a certain extent unless you have perfect understanding of all other cultures?"
8199,German engineer = expat  Bangladeshi engineer = migrant worker  🤷🏿‍♂️
8200,"German here, long time in Singapore on employment pass."
8201,It often is better to bring a manager from another country in as an expat than losing the newly hired Singaporean manager after 1-2 years when a competitor offers 15% more.
8202,Those on VTL vacation to Germany can take a trip there legally now.
8203,"And what matters is what the intent and substance of the act rather than focus on a narrow minded liberal's interpretation to equate ""brownface"" to racism."
8204,"Not being racist, but India, like China, still has strong kinship networks that help each other to get to Singapore."
8205,Get racist  Don't get paid sis
8206,Get rid of VTL ffs
8207,"The fatigue induced from the nonstop charges of racism, bigotry, victimhood, oppression, etc is only just getting started in Singapore."
8208,"A possible way forward may be to widen the range of FDW employment structures, and charge a premium rate for live in helpers."
8209,Getting more Singaporeans to take up jobs vacated by foreign workers is good.
8210,"But who's going to stop the government if hypothetically 5 years from now, they start to lower the foreign worker levies again and import more foreigners?"
8211,"When I lived in Texas, I did not experienced racism nor feeling unsafe, not even once."
8212,But it doesn't stop there because these racist people will still continue to hire base on race they just don't show it on paper.
8213,Gg if workers boom boom with maids while being infected.
8214,"Told me alot of the kids there and to an extent some faculty members are racist and misinformed about Indians and Malays to the point that you would go, “Eh sialah, what are they smoking in there?”   My girlfriend got her wakeup call when she started working and met decent and good Indians and Malays as compared to what was fed to her by her classmates, some teachers and even family."
8215,Give me the foreign workers anyday
8216,call out racism.
8217,accused of being too sensitive or causing offence by not ignoring racists etc.
8218,Give the maid a break.
8219,I assume the maid also need to take care of baby in the day and also complete her household chores.
8220,"Given all the paperwork required for VTL, non-VTL doesn't look so bad if your destination is cat 2 or 3."
8221,"Given so many high profile cases in Singapore where people got into hot water for racist/incendiary posts on their FB pages, why does it still happen?"
8222,"Given the majority are ethnic Chinese, that's xenophobia, not racism."
8223,I feel like overall he's being horribly vague as to what he thinks constitutes racism while at the same time raising his fist against the idea of it.
8224,Would revealing the makeup or composition of foreign workers holding S-passes compromise our competitive advantage globally?
8225,"I don’t think a language test is necessary, eventually they will get the hang of it."
8226,And keeping migrant workers confined in dormitories.
8227,Glad our VTL & 2pax dine-in restrictions are starting to pay dividends.
8228,"Glad to hear that the government does aid in protecting foreign workers, though not so glad to hear about the treatment you’ve received from Singaporeans."
8229,Glad you admit you’re okay with racism.
8230,Glad you made it before the VTL got cut just now.
8231,Of course there would be some degree of xenophobia.
8232,It’s always sky is falling because ... xenophobia.
8233,"As far as domestic helpers, I know not all families treat their help the same."
8234,God forbid we do the sensible things to protect ourselves because xenophobic
8235,The OP is suggesting English proficiency tests AS PART OF immigration policy.
8236,"Yes, your ""immigration policy"" will fail."
8237,"God, some of the casual racism here....man, some of these are literally horror stories."
8238,"Everyone can be racist, not just the majority race."
8239,"Going down this road, everything will be deemed racist eventually"
8240,"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/mzk706/why_rchina_rkorea_and_rjapan_have_no_mod_thats/  https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiHateCommunities/comments/mvzob3/proof_rchina_is_run_by_sexpats_the_true_china_sub/   With the mods removing specific terms like ""CECA"" while keeping other supposedly ""controversial"" terms like ""wumao"", it actually gives rise to suspicions as similar cases have happened before in the past."
8241,Gonna be honest here: the reason we resent globalization is that the increased competition from foreign talent doesn't come with a corresponding increase in pay to match foreign companies.
8242,"Our government policies are constantly depressing the cost of employees here, to the point where we've got 40% foreign talent which is around that of New York, yet our salaries are nowhere near that of New York salaries."
8243,Our sacrifices and competition with foreign talent is not commensurate with the benefits of globalization.
8244,"There's the angle also about cultural friction, but the reasons quoted in that direction are so often pejorative and racist that I don't want to wade into that mire."
8245,Gonna bookmark this thread for when people ask “what racism?” or suggest that “/r/Sg full of ultra-liberals”.
8246,And my point was maybe its just xenophobia and not racism.
8247,So clearly its not racism.
8248,As a company owner you get regulars reports and prompts to GTFO all of your foreign workers.
8249,"The EP process is VERY though and if you want to hire an expat, you have to run the ad on mycareerfuture for 30 days and then have to give detailed report on how many local candidates you have interviewed."
8250,"I read on my kindle :D  >As a foreigner, is there a way to best integrate and not >become an isolated western immigrant?"
8251,"If I didn't have a girlfriend at the time, what is the dating life like there for expats?"
8252,"That's not racism, that's telling it like it is."
8253,So the looking down on others based on nothing but their skin colour is very relevant here to label it as racism.
8254,"The parents' absence was just the catalyst for the maid's relationship with the boy to grow, which is something that I don't think has been done before (I don't watch many TV dramas) and Anthony Chen managed to do remarkably well."
8255,"The portrayal of the mother seemed to perfectly express the bristliness and anxiety of a mother having to juggle a dangerously rowdy son, a maid that was a better mother than her, a job that could fall apart any time, a failing marriage, and withering family finances all at once."
8256,>negative space created by their neglect defines the state of the relationship between the boy and his maid.
8257,This is the first time anyone's used this 'cliche' in the context of a boy's relationship with his maid (I think) and 2.
8258,>the source of conflict is conveniently sent away because the family could not afford to pay the maid anymore.
8259,"Examples include being against illegal immigrants, unfavourable trade deals, contribution to world organisations, being focused on local production and jobs."
8260,I wish PAP or Opposition candidate mention the structural racism in our society.
8261,"As for not coming back, they are expats."
8262,A self-confessed racist has to face the consequences.
8263,"In fact, they should make employers pay electronically to the domestic helper's bank account"
8264,"Good for her, but I'm worried that this would have a ""chilling effect"" on other domestic helpers with actual mistreatment."
8265,"Of course, the domestic helper will believe, since MOM did take action on that helper and would endure all possible abuse for that pittance we give to helpers."
8266,"If the maids were okay with it, then fine."
8267,"Some have proven me dead wrong, and I get along well with them, but some just continue to be that black sheep that shaped my perception of CECA FT."
8268,A major chunk of Singaporeans are racist assholes.
8269,For those saying “I don’t think what PA did was racist”.
8270,How many steps away is “culturally insensitive” to “racist”?
8271,Good luck finding other African American expats in Singapore to learn from their experiences.

8274,Really wish i had the linguistic competency to be fluent in my mother tongue.
8275,The racist overtures of the world aren't helping but that doesn't mean we give up the fight.
8276,Good on you for realizing now but I am gobsmacked to hear that people are surprised about the deep lying racism in Singapore.
8277,"Other companies like KFC etc might see this as an opportunity to raise their PR game, and do something good for the migrant workers."
8278,"Either way, we should applaud whatever efforts to help migrant workers and not dismiss them."
8279,Good on you for standing up to that racist prick.
8280,I see a lot of xenophobia towards Filipinos in Singapore.
8281,I really wish those here would tell the principal on those racist teachers
8282,"Every country that has migrants would have an easier time if the immigrants choose to learn the language, avoid disruptive behaviors or attitudes(even if legal), respect the social contracts, choose to integrate and be more like the new place where they are living and working and less like where they might have come from."
8283,"Otherwise, they are going to get social friction and end up handing ammunition to the racists."
8284,"Good point but like you pointed out, maids currently are living with their employers."
8285,So hiring 2 maids might not be feasible for the family.
8286,"Good point, am having problems taking care of my grandmother too but fearing abuse might deter employing maid especially my grandmother do get aggressive almost on a daily basis."
8287,"Seems like the Japanese companies would rather recruit Japanese graduates (that will cost at least $4,500 per month to qualify for employment pass), rather than locals at lower costs (average salary of $3,600 in 2019)..  For reference, Japanese fresh graduates are paid an average of $2,700 per month back in Japan."
8288,Not just in foreign workers and or construction sectors.
8289,"I live in Australia and yet to have personal encounters with racist folks, mostly because I’m a big guy even by western standards and most racist attacks here are on females."
8290,I think its obvious some people on the thread have never had a maid.

8292,"I am no defender of the restrictions but is there any reason why we should keep expats who arent willing to be here and are, by definition, mobile global workers?"
8293,I assume most migrant workers are young and healthy so unlikely to see serious effects from Covid with a few rare exceptions.
8294,Good that they came down hard on the maid who abused the employer's trust.
8295,"Whilst I believe that we ultimately need to wean ourselves off foreign domestic help, stringent laws that punish both errant employers and maids are necessary"
8296,"Good thing the maid was silly enough to contradict herself, if the maid was smart it'd be pretty tough for the guy to prove his innocence."
8297,When casual racism comes up in your single race social circle - question it!
8298,I'm not saying you have to throw up an ultimatum and leave your friends/family but just catching people on racism makes people think twice before they speak.
8299,Did we need to know he's a foreign worker tho?
8300,"Good travel hub, low taxes, good expat life for 3-4 years unless covid is around, all good reasons to come to SG."
8301,And not one migrant worker has come across her demanding for a thank you.
8302,Losing 1k for a migrant worker is equivalent to losing 3mths of savings.
8303,"I hope they learn their lesson and come out better, but I also hope they are banned from hiring maids ever again."
8304,Google foreign worker quota.
8305,But there's a quota in place to ensure that companies are not 100% staffed by foreign workers.
8306,"For domestic workers; [Dollars & Sense, ](https://dollarsandsense.sg/2019-edition-much-cost-hire-maid-singapore/)[MSIG](https://www.msig.com.sg/lifestyle-library/how-much-maids-salary-singapore)."
8307,"For construction workers; TWC2: [The S Pass minimum salary tends to rise with time but in any case, the typical salary for construction, sanitation or domestic workers is well below $2,300 — more often in the region of $400 to $$800 per month."
8308,Getting an expat to do NS does not seem ok for National Security now does it?

8311,"If they ban people from hiring maids for the residential address the convicted is staying at, then the ban can be quite effective."
8312,Gotta divide the people with xenophobic talk before uniting them for GE.

8315,Gov say don't be racist but keep insisting on the existence of races.
8316,There are several thousands of maids in oversea prior to 2013 law and there will be maids after this ban.
8317,Government says that maids can leave their homes on off days so long as they do not meet friends and inform their employers in advance.
8318,Government should implement sensitivity training mandatory community program 10 sessions for everyone who wrote racist comment on that post.

8328,"I get that,I'm not accusing them of racism but that's just how it is."
8329,Great that someone remember the foreign workers!
8330,"Recently someone emailed MOM to ask whether foreign workers who leave Singapore for a home visit has to continue this temperature taking and logging twice a day, while they are overseas."
8331,"Now, remove the daily testing for VTL travelers."
8332,Ignore all the other racist posts :)
8333,Keep your mother tongue in the home and among your friends.
8334,Greeting a Chinese in Chinese is racist?
8335,Where is the element of racism?

8347,Grown ass man needs a maid to cut him some jelly and punched her for it.
8348,How many locals are willing to take the plunge and go into the precision engineering sector now when wages are depressed AF and bosses still prefer to hire foreign workers because they can accept wages which are otherwise too low for locals to reasonably live on?
8349,"Guess I worded it wrongly, yes they are all expats."
8350,"If its the same for Japanese/Chinese companies then we do have a problem with foreign talent as a whole, not just CECA"
8351,Why not open our government to foreign talents then.
8352,"Guess if you're confused, you are clearly racist."
8353,To LMW: Don't think you're some big shot when you aggressively capitalize on existing xenophobia and think you're working for the betterment of our local PMET's.

8375,I guess it can be expressed as racism in the street though.
8376,On the one hand I hate racism but on the other I do understand why people feel like their country is being taken away from them.
8377,When people en masse lose faith with that it can manifest in undesirable ways; simplistically it's racism yes but there are causes beyond mere stupidity.
8378,"But also, I get the same racist comments from fellow malays as well."
8379,"More alarmingly, there were instances of thinly veiled racism and belittling of the cultures of other races here in Singapore."
8380,Had a close friend argue with me about racism in Singapore some time back.
8381,A Chinese colleague of his had experienced racism while on a job attachment to Australia.
8382,"When I told him that the Aussies were so warm and friendly towards me, with the only incident I encountered coming from an airport security staff, and that I faced more racism in Singapore, he refused to believe my account over his colleague's."
8383,"I just told him, that if one is from the majority race in the country, it's no surprise to think racism doesn't exist."
8384,"Had a maid too, she eats everything we eat because, it’s fucking food, it’s replaceable and how much can one human eat?!"

8391,Haha aside from the 'expat' pedantry...
8392,Just booked a flight to and from KL without VTL.
8393,"I honestly think I did alright for my mother tongue, but still not satisfactory."
8394,"I don't mean to be racist but I have to admit I do look down on Brits sometimes, who can be a bit pretentious and not as clever as they make themselves out to be."
8395,Haha i like how u directly assume im an expat just because i defended expat/foreigners.
8396,The expat has more to offer than just the hefty package.
8397,Your mind is too simple to comprehend that racist preferences is still racist.
8398,Go on being racist and thinking it’s okay.
8399,"Haha to be fair I’ve no doubt that is the common situation, just pointing out that the big expat packages still exist."
8400,"Haha, I am not going to start a big movement, but i don't think anyone should be fine with racism just because it's the way it's been for a long time... or that it's second nature.. Do you disagree with me?"

8402,"I really enjoy walking around, cycling to East Coast Park, Bedok Reservoir, avoiding any ritzy resto's and preferring to eat/drink and congregate at hawker centers (my expat colleagues aren't all as much into hawker centers like I am), and shopping at local HDB shops vs Cold Storage and other big places."

8412,Hahah imagine conflating concern of covid with racism.
8413,"Ive not included your obvious ones like construction, shipbuilding and domestic helpers."
8414,"Somehow people think some rumour about how Malay food stalls charge is akin to systemic racism that minorities face on a daily basis for serious matters like employment, rental, etc."

8423,The govt really really needs to step up on protecting domestic workers' welfare and safety

8429,"Growing up here it was very common to here racial slurs from classmates and occasionally, xenophobic comments from teachers too."
8430,People just don't want to admit that a lot of us Singaporeans are just racist as fuck.
8431,You also won't be able to socialise well with the western expats.
8432,"As a city for an expat, it is generally much better for singles or families from Western countries or North Asia."
8433,Hardly anyone is on an expat package in Singapore nowadays.
8434,Hardwarezone demographics might very well be the crowd who are bearing the brunt of being outcompeted by cheaper expat professionals from the region.
8435,Our main issue is that Singapore is a relatively young country that has yet to evolve a clear national identity that fully overrides racial ones - something that is unfortunately exarcerbated by the CMIO framework the government uses in Singapore.
8436,"As for your last two examples, yes, those *are* examples of underlying racism and racial tension."
8437,Has anyone noticed that none of the so called 'false' claims on CECA get POFMA?

8446,I also read on some expat board that the area has incessant noise from the temples.
8447,"Have a friend in a Japanese company, even before covid hit, they've started to ""localise"" because it's on average about an additional 300k a person regardless of the rank to bring in a Japanese expat due to additional costs in terms of housing, etc."

8452,"You just have to make the effort, and expand beyond the expat community!"

8454,Have we not left the specific case of domestic workers to discuss eating with your boss in general?
8455,">   >We need people who can speak English with a Singaporean accent AND one mother tongue (either Malay, Tamil or Mandarin Chinese) and record their conversations."
8456,"There was great emphasis on using Singlish and your mother tongue (Mandarin, Tamil or Malay) in conversation, in addition to the importance of speakers engaging in genuine conversation without reading texts, playing games or other activities."
8457,"In 2016, an [AI chatbot built by Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist) was taught to be racist and misogynistic because twitter users fed it with comments that were of that nature."
8458,That minorities can't be racist.
8459,Make the maid work 24/7/365 and sleep on a mattress on the kitchen floor?
8460,Why are you suddenly trying to defend your race when not one person in this fucking thread has ever said all Chinese people are racist?
8461,Have you not paid attention to a frequent topic of discussion in this sub over the last couple of months or general political sentiment during last year’s GE... why is calling out racism divisive but perpetuating it not?
8462,Have you notice that we are 1 of the few developed nations that still uses maids?
8463,We even have dogs and children but we get the maids to take care of them.
8464,"Have you read the parties’ manifesto?They do address the issues, most notably WP on Foreign workers (not just domestic workers), education reforms, penalties for discriminatory hiring, global warming and the arts scene."
8465,Have you realised that the only people who treat domestic workers bad are Chinese?
8466,The Malays and the Indians who have domestic helpers don’t do this shit.
8467,Have you seen how those agency people talk to the domestic helpers?
8468,There was a foreign worker sitting inside.
8469,If you really can't hack mother tongue just take mother tongue b and save yourself the agony.
8470,"I actually completed mother tongue, still can't speak it."
8471,Have you tried buying medical coverage for maids before :) 30k is absolutely paltry… I had an estimated bill of 8k for two days stay in kkh.
8472,"Now if my maid goes into hospital for an extended period, I will have to appeal For social media help."
8473,And this doesn’t even factor for the most troubling problem: skills competency which is essential for incentivizing the retention of SG’s status as a world hub  The populist segments that like to paint the expats as the reason of all the troubles here are about to cash a painful reality check in time.
8474,"To whatever you are trying to justify, I am afraid the video is not just simply racist or a call for others to harass."

8478,"But given the prevalence of such open displays of racism, I think I should be more kaypoh."
8479,Having a high median income doesn't mean there isn't racism against Indians in Sin.
8480,"Indian Americans are actually the richest ethnic group in the US, but likewise it would be naive to assume there isn't racism in hiring and promotion decisions against them in the US."
8481,Perhaps they would be even richer if not for racism.
8482,Having a live in domestic helper is not unique to Singapore in this region.
8483,Those that get to become maid in Singapore are those that will also become maid in their home country.
8484,The one that need fixing is the agency system here that can take up to 6 months of maid salary for doing minimal works.
8485,"Core to this, I believe, is immigration and attracting foreign talent and investors."
8486,"We may have fewer children born here, but expats can supplement our workforce with high value, high quality labor."
8487,"We will also be more vulnerable to external political or economic forces, like the pandemic causing many expats to return home."
8488,"Having a maid that lives with you is quite unheard of nowadays, but housekeepers aren't."
8489,"Having also just gone through VTL and experienced what the OP is talking about first hand, it's not just that Changi is different, it's also that they're totally careless *and* paranoid to the max at the same time."
8490,"VTL bizarroland only starts after baggage claim, where you get herded into tents for the ""6 simple steps"" of testing: queue to enter tent, queue to register, queue to waiting area, queue to get tested, finally get your nose raped, and then plop back into the public area where you're supposed to go straight to taxis etc, but there's zero enforcement that you actually do."
8491,"The closest form of racism I've witnessed is when close friends share racists jokes of our races - ""a bench can support a family but..."" or ""cheena ching chong"" and as far as I can tell, the fact that we can joke about these shows how little we see race."
8492,"No, I do not support racism."
8493,What annoys me is that it seems that the majority race are the ones making the most noise about this racism issue but I would really and sincerely love to hear POV of the minority races!
8494,If you are still experiencing racism everyday I'm so so sorry because that isn't what Singapore is at all (at least to me).
8495,"Again, I'm all against racism."
8496,"However I don't want this to be a case of ""you must take a stand- if you don't, you're being ignorant of racism in Singapore"" and all the SJWs can feel justified of their actions against the government."
8497,Having maids really brings out the worst in people.
8498,"You wouldn't think they have a single mean bone in their body, but when it comes to their maids it's like they're a different person."
8499,"Having seen your replies here to a few threads related to FTs and the like, what is your definition of expat?"
8500,Having specific parties for specific races **is a racist policy** and directly leads to the majority race dominating the government and passing policies that benefit their own race.
8501,Hdb has racist policies as well by not allowing malay/Indians to sell to Chinese!
8502,"Hdb have racial quota for resale flats, is it they racist?"
8503,He IS a racist.
8504,So I can tell you that minorities can be racist to others.
8505,Everyone is a racist deep down.
8506,But some can admit they were racist once while others die2 dw admit.
8507,He builds a strong argument and I have to say I agree with him on all points  [edit] downvoted again for being an expat..?
8508,He did it :) While I am kinda side with PA on not using the racism card here there is no need to use snow flake
8509,"If someone in Singapore said something racist, we will condemn them, some will even report it to the police."
8510,Turns out being a president gives one a right to be racist.
8511,He didn't say that there isn't racism in Singapore.
8512,He doesn't suggest inevitability:  >**Root Cause of Foreign Dorm Infections**   >   >Keep in mind that we actually did have one foreign worker dorm incident even in the first wave.
8513,"You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable."
8514,He fled a war-torn country as a kid and stole food to survive as an illegal homeless immigrant.
8515,"He is a classic banana xenophobe and racist - ""I am one of the good Chinese, not those dirty ones"", this quote says enough: >That's the other china virus they sprouted out besides corona."
8516,Trump-level racism and xenophobia.
8517,He is a nice real-life demonstration of why we need so much foreign talent in the banking industry.
8518,"However it said there may be ""adverse consequences"" when applying for employment pass, student pass, and PR in the future."
8519,"Go hire a maid and pay her $1k sgd yourself, not including levies and personal expenses."
8520,Why not publish the number of employment passes issued under ceca etc?
8521,"He is probably the worst person to be talking about this at this moment tbh, given he is Indian and the optics of him going down hard on the recent spate of racism may rile up even more racist bullshit."
8522,"He is racist not in the sense that let's burn all malays, INdians etc etc."
8523,"I don't think there's any negative sentiments against Japanese generally, the issue about the immigration policy was about foreigners ""stealing"" our jobs, so there may be some dissent when you first arrive, but so long you don't break any major socio-cultural norms we have, it'll be okay."
8524,"His punishment and apology may not exactly transform Singapore into a racism-fee utopia, but people like you who refuse to move on are also holding us back as a society."
8525,"He lost the argument that CECA and hiring had nothing to do with each other, then went after my personal account post history because as they say, if you can't argue facts, go after the person."
8526,"So, poster going around defending CECA/Indians and spreading falsehood that CECA and Hiring are unrelated is not a Singaporean resident, based in America, and here frantically trying to distort an issue that is completely irrelevant to him."
8527,I wonder who is the racist here.
8528,He may be saying it casually but he's absolutely right....that **is** exactly how things are and there is an institutionalized hierarchy in the racism.
8529,So he cannot stake claim as a victim of racism in Singapore (or anywhere).
8530,"That mindset is the exact reason why minorities still have to prove to the majority that racism exists here because it comes in different, implicit forms."
8531,Before we care about other country’s racism we should look at our doorstep first.
8532,"He probably is bullied at work and low-ranked, hence taking it out on the maid to wash his car that he can barely pay for."
8533,He said less expats then more jobs for locals.
8534,He thinks that government treats migrant workers too well and should let them die instead to reduce the number of cases.
8535,He used to be more of what XX would call SJWish when he would rant or call out casual racism he witnessed or experienced.
8536,He wants to increase productivity of a maid.
8537,"/s  Why hire 2, when I can deploy my maid at my son’s place ?"
8538,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporean-33-who-allegedly-hurled-racist-remarks-attacked-undergraduate-at-east-coast-park
8539,He was right until he added the racism.
8540,He's a passive aggressive racist.
8541,"He's racist, and Shanmugam is Indian... Why the hell would he listen to him?"
8542,"The title also stated ""non-expats""."
8543,"Most of the foreign indians are northen hindus who are the ultra high caste, lighter skin, that place a very heavy emphasis on caste and class, that are coming over en-masse via CECA."
8544,"south indians (tamils) have more dravidian in them, so darker skin, broader noses, while the CECAs have lighter skin, more ang moh looks due to the aryan genes, this one is social studies sec 2 study one leh, you from RI ah?"
8545,"He/she's exaggerating about the masks, that's not a problem, but yeah I've heard grumblings from a lot of expats that in a world with no scope for traveling, they would 100% rather gtfo of Singapore and go back home."
8546,"Heading to Brunei a quarantine and a good reason to visit is still required I think, while VTL applies to those entering Singapore from VTL approved countries."
8547,"So yes, racism against majority is also racism."
8548,"I have an employment pass visa, but she does not and is looking for work."
8549,Not sure what's so special for these countries under the current VTL other than the economic and trade contributions.
8550,Heard it’s Japan that rejected the VTL cause they need more time to vax their population.
8551,I've ever seen this drunk expat going up on stage to dance with the girls.
8552,"Fact is, with the sheer volume of foreign workers here, allowing free travel/reentry would result in massive demand for hotel quarantine and such around peak periods."
8553,"I went to primary school in the 80s and the local kids hated on the (rich) Indonesian students, rich Indian expats and (rich)HongKong-ees."
8554,"What I want to do is a mini documentary, interviewing locals and expats on Singapore history, current events, media, entertainment, daily life and struggles, etc."
8555,I've heard that it's very difficult to get a job there as an immigrant so I was wondering what some people already living there would think of my chances of getting hired.
8556,"Having read about the notorious open immigration policy, it seemed a bit shocking."
8557,Thank you for hearing me out and sorry if there are some grammar mistakes since English is not my mother tongue.
8558,"Hello OP, this is a fault of our incompetent dormitory managers and the embarrassing actions of Josephine Teo."
8559,"Thank you for going there to expose this horrible situation, and hopefully try to help our foreign workers in any way that you can."
8560,"Hello Reddiporeans, I am an expat working here in Singapore and my wife is doing here master's course in US of A and is keen to do her summer internship in Singapore."
8561,"Just had a job offer, How realistic is the approval for employment pass ?"
8562,"After some research I believe there is quota for experts, but not sure how is it and is there any opportunity for expats like me, espcially Vietnamese ?"
8563,I'm an expat (here since May) that is returning home to the US for the Christmas holiday.
8564,Thank you so much in advance for putting up with the annoying expat post.
8565,Our maid is due to go in two weeks as her work permit is expiring.
8566,"At this rate, our maid, who have worked for us for 23 years, will have to leave on the 19th of Feb, her birthday."
8567,Hello Singaporeans I'm expat and since CB I have no possibility to meet new people in real life.
8568,I have lived in Singapore in the past (spent a 3-months vacation) and I am aware of the CMIO (Chinese-Malay-Indian-Other) framework when it comes to race classification.
8569,"I live in a student dormitory, and I take a bicycle to school, which is 20 mins of walking away, everyday."
8570,"Hello all, I am waiting for employment pass, and the last week MOM asked for verification proof."
8571,Is there anyone holding an employment pass and has experienced such a thing before?
8572,The problem with people like you who hire FDW is as I mentioned the entitlement that you deserve someone who delivers butler standards of service while paying peanuts.
8573,Butlers earn on average 50K overseas performing the same kind of tasks that maids do.
8574,We had a maid but we got rid of her after finding out she did not contribute much to the daily household chores since my grandmother loved to do everything herself.
8575,"Hello everyone,  I just had a very quick question; what is the experience like for an African American (male) expat in Singapore?"
8576,"Could any expats, locals, travellers enlighten me on some cool things to do?"
8577,"From my point of view, there are many global corporations as well as agencies and production houses in Singapore, so I kind of expect the job industry to be quite dynamic...   - My friend (also an expat) said that employers tend to prefer to hire locals and/or Westerners for PR/marketing positions."
8578,Hello fellow expat Celiac!
8579,"Most classes I see cater to expats (from google search), and while I’m a foreigner I do have a solid basis in mandarin (albeit at a elementary school level)."
8580,"Back when I was a kid, mother tongue was more of the norm so most of my friends were always speaking in broken English."
8581,I see other issues being taken so seriously in Singapore but then even til today there is RAMPANT racism.
8582,"I shit you not almost everywhere I go, no matter how nice the people are I'm bound to hear racist comments."
8583,"I remember there was a post about a foreign exchange student who did the ""chinese eyes"" and everyone was outraged saying Singapore absolutely does not welcome racists."
8584,Let's just put it into perspective for a bit:  Chinese people being racist towards Malays  Malays being racist towards Chinese.
8585,It's shitty to be racist on both ends but the one's actually taking the damage are the minorities.
8586,People being racist affects me the most because I bear the full load of it from multiple people who unforunately share the same mindset whether they're good people or not.
8587,"&#x200B;  Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt'."
8588,How many times I got annoyed/upset by racist remarks and I had someone tell me I'm overreacting.
8589,How brazen some of these people are with their racism.
8590,There's a group of Indian guys out there who are so affected by this racism that they try to disassociate from being Indian.
8591,But this is the state of how things are based on how normalised racism is here.
8592,I am absolutely not justifying the racism that chinese people face from Indians and Malays either.
8593,&#x200B;  I just made this post to show you that from my days as a kid up til today I'm still heavily affected by racism and it's not just a few bad apples.
8594,Me saying I had a chinese/korean gf at one point was to show the racist reactions I got from my chinese peers indicating shock at an Indian being able to do such things.
8595,"who lives on it, expat or local."
8596,"Hello redditors,  I'm here on an employment pass."
8597,I must have missed the fine print that says only racism against minorities will be published.
8598,"I would love to live somewhere near other young people (both expats and Singaporeans), and somewhere with nearby access to green space/nature."
8599,Going to Singapore was a bit of a culture shock due to how entrenched the CMIO system is.
8600,You can consider applying as a translator for Healthserve to support them during clinic operations (they offer medical services for migrant workers) :)
8601,"The employment pass will be requested very shortly, however there is one thing that may be an issue - I have no education."
8602,"After applying to jobs for a few weeks and talking to some recruiters, I'm getting the impression that it will be very difficult to get an analyst position as a foreigner due to the required ratio of local to foreign workers, and the fact that analysts don't necessarily need specialized skills."
8603,"Hello, I'm writing this on behalf of a friend (33F, expat) who is currently going through rough times in her life and would certainly benefit from counsel from professionals."
8604,"Hello, I’m a Bangladeshi (Singaporean PR) currently serving NS and I’m looking for avenues for which I can volunteer to help out the migrant worker community in Singapore."
8605,"Hello, at least expats who are allowed to return to SG , aren't charged additional fees."
8606,And also most of my expat friends have gotten their first shot already.
8607,I'm sorry that this happened to him but I don't believe he is speaking for the majority of the expats here.
8608,"Hello, fellow Reddiporeans and foreign talent!"
8609,Totally unacceptable and racist.
8610,"Now for your question about foreign workers, I think most SG have a mental model of 2 kinds of foreign labor - the manual laborer from south Asia, and the white collar worker."
8611,"Helo redditors in S'pore :)  I came here on a work permit sponsored by my company but unfortunately the work that I have been assigned is totally uninspiring clerical job (where, as an added perk I need to put up with extremely uncooperative and even racist and abusive co-workers)."
8612,Most people just call them “helper” when they need to be “politically right” and revert to “maid” at home or with close family/friends where you don’t need to appear “educated”.
8613,In my experience maids or FDWs do practically all the domestic chores.
8614,"Focus on how they treat their maid/FDW, not on the politically correct words they choose to use."
8615,"There probably is a generational difference in treatment of maids, no surprises there, and this is correlated with their choice of word, not a causative factor."
8616,"They know they come here on a 2 year contract and yet they are able to break it after only a few months, this will cost the employer 1500-3000 dollars just to find a replacement and of course the maid agencies only covers replacements for the first 6 months (not to mention they earn month finding replacements as well)    Sorry for the rant, its just the time and effort spent training them is one thing, this is also costing alot of money as there isn't much protection for employers who are basically told to suck it up and find another one."
8617,I'd love to find ways to interact with the various cultures so I don't get stuck in the expat trap of staying in my comfort zone.
8618,"Almost every household here have hired a helper, and that will be hundreds of thousands of maids in Singapore."
8619,There has been less than 10 cases of maid abuse every year.
8620,That's less than 1% of maids being employed here in Singapore.
8621,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-respect-people-from-all-races-but-quite-a-number-find-racism-still-an-issue
8622,"If she's not happy about her maid's actions, she can just fire the maid."
8623,"If the maid stole things, just report police."
8624,Making a fuss on the internet trying to get her 50k followers to join her in hating her maid makes her a bitch.
8625,She says when the maid borrowed the money the work permit wasn't cancelled yet.
8626,"Which is nonsense tbh,  all our maids go home heavier than they arrive 😂😂😂"
8627,Her racism so rabz she is racist 2
8628,"Here I am wondering why mainstream media labels Singaporean workers as being ""too entitled"", when the entitlements (housing/ childcare benefits) they receive from the employer is nothing compared to an expat."
8629,"Here in Malaysia, a lot of hawker stalls are being manned by foreign workers like Indonesians and Myanmarese."
8630,"Of course that has also stirred up some xenophobia here, with some (maybe a lot) of people saying that food quality has gone down because foreigners are cooking."
8631,Here is a harsh truth you guys won't like - people don't need live in maids.
8632,If you have a live in maid they should be paid a decent salary.
8633,"**Yesterday**, MOM claimed this falsehood and issued POFMA:  ""MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they **would lose their work pass privileges**."""
8634,"**Yesterday**, MOM claimed this falsehood and issued POFMA:  ""MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they **would lose their work pass privileges**."""
8635,Singapore unintentionally saw the rise of coronavirus infections in migrant workers.
8636,Its self defeating - for example it is likely that people would choose to hire others from their 'tribes' given equal opportunity applicants if they had experiences with racism.
8637,Its still against the rules but perfectly understandable - who wants to deal with racists at work and people are very good at perceiving these kind of biases even when you think you can control them.
8638,"If you answer yes to at least 2 of the 3 , you will still have a good time and your chances of experiencing any racism are very Low."
8639,Here is the entire legal text  https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/Singapore-ftas/-/media/ESG/Files/Non-Financial-Assistance/For-Companies/Free-Trade-Agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/CECA_Legal_Text.pdf
8640,Here they ask maids not to go lucky plaza..   Then those amdk free to roam Robertson quay and etc...
8641,"Maid stole more than $34k worth of items from Changi Airport Group chairman, his family  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/maid-stole-more-than-34k-worth-of-items-from-changi-airport-group-chairman?xtor=CS3-18&utm_source=STiPhone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-09-04%2014%3A09%3A07"
8642,Same old shit again..   Up and down this dormitory..   Noone asked for 'pology.. ^Don't^jio^me^lim^kopi^please
8643,Everyone learns the three mother tongues conversationally.
8644,Here's a thought... how about we treat migrant workers like human beings.
8645,"Do you have white skin (Y/N)  If Y, even if you make no money, you're an expat."
8646,Here's my take  Telling other people off about interracial dating is racist and also a form of harassment to impose one own view onto another person's life.
8647,"Not renting out solely due to racial preference is also racist, but it doesn't have the harassment part of it."
8648,Racist is racist.
8649,Here’s a a story about her from 2016 https://theindependent.sg/encountering-a-racist-on-the-mrt/
8650,"I've lived in Singapore my entire life,  (family came as typical expats many moons ago), I became a PR when I was 18 years old and finished High School (prior to that was on a dependant pass), Singapore is all I know, and has been home my entire 35 years."
8651,"I never went through the local school system, so I still feel like that ""expat"" / ""third culture kid"", thought I have many local friends and colleagues, I know I missed out on the most ""Singaporean"" experience a foreigner can have."
8652,"I need some help regarding a situation involving a domestic helper stealing from my grandparents, and more complications."
8653,"So, last Saturday, the maid woke up at 5am, before anyone else was awake, to head downstairs to withdraw money from my grandmother’s account."
8654,The maid even followed her along.
8655,"Later in the day, the maid left the house with her passport, the house keys, a bag of personal belongings, and was confirmed to have left the country that day."
8656,"The maid had borrowed from a loanshark, and today the loanshark messaged my grandmother to harass her."
8657,"He threatened to upload the maid’s personal info online on Facebook, and also sent her a nude pic of the maid (though not sure if photoshopped or not), to my grandmother."
8658,"At first of course we thought, ok that’s not really our problem, and the maid deserved it."
8659,"To be clear, that’s racist because you’re choosing to ignore their culture and/or language for your own convenience."
8660,But it is a little racist.
8661,"Hey OP US citizen living in SG right now, just PMed you with some questions about VTL travel back to the states"
8662,"Are you more frustrated by what you think is hypocrisy on their part, than you are by the racist structures of power that pretty much affect all societies around the world (albeit in different ways)?"
8663,"I was in the same situation- Indian girl, grew up in the 90s, didn’t speak Tamil, faced a shit load of racism growing up."
8664,"And I’m ashamed to say I was one of those Indians you talked about- I tried to hide my Indian-ness, pretended I couldn’t speak my mother tongue, straightened my hair religiously so it wouldn’t be curly, was super conscious of hanging out with only Indian friends."
8665,"It took moving away from Singapore, and years of unlearning the ingrained racism to be proud of my background and gain self worth."
8666,So it won't be fair to say the government accepts racism.
8667,Even the citizens do not accept racism.
8668,So yes there may be racism especially in your case since you're not used to it.
8669,"So what I will say, is to tweak your understanding of racism to our context."
8670,"You probably will interact with people from all over the world in Singapore, and frankly Singapore is lot less sexist and racist than Japan."
8671,"Hey bro I know people are down voting you for being off topic (because not ""racism""), but all forms of discrimination should be condemned and I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that."
8672,Since VTL are opening up soon.
8673,"Hey everyone,   I'm an American expat living in Shenzhen, China."
8674,"As a foreigner, is there a way to best integrate and not become an isolated western immigrant?"
8675,"Whenever I see foreign workers on public transport talking to each other in their groups, I've always wondered what they talk about."
8676,"Also, if there is any Aussie expats reading this, any advice would be fantastic."
8677,are Singaporeans really as xenophobic as I've heard and seen on the news?
8678,Do you think I can get an employment pass/s-pass without a Bachelor?
8679,"I got a degree in Germany after I finished my 3 year vocational training, but I'm not sure if that's enough to obtain an employment pass."
8680,"Hey guys,  is there any maid cafe that is still open?"
8681,"- I'm not coming in on a fancy expat relocation package, so is there anything I should be on the lookout for?"
8682,"I don't want to live in a little cushy expat bubble and only hang out with people who have the same background as I because that defeats the purpose of moving anywhere, tbh."
8683,I'd never know what's behind the gate--to know whether it's just a shitty maid or shitty employer.
8684,"My mom decided to not entertain her and wanted to close the door so the lady turned to interview my maid, who had opened the door, instead."
8685,"My maid was very upfront with all the answers, and my mom even said she tried to show the lady my brothers' phone numbers which my mum has written in a notebook."
8686,Afterwards my mom created a big hoo-ha and told me to educate my maid about loansharks and scammers that had recently been featured in the news.
8687,"After questioning her, my maid revealed that the lady claimed to be from MOM and asked for her WP number, salary, bonus, no."
8688,So I think my maid indeed had been duped into giving out her details.
8689,Tldr; lady claiming to be from MOM extracted info out of my helpful maid.
8690,Educate your parents/maid about this.
8691,"Sorry, false alarm but I still think my move to tell my domestic helper not to divulge sensitive information to just anyone without verification is necessary."
8692,Her family recently got a letter from a licensed money lender (Horison I think) asking for payment for the loan the maid took out.
8693,The maid did not inform the family about it and applied for it before her work permit was cancelled.
8694,The maid did apply for the loan while she had her permit but it was cancelled and she's not even in the country anymore.
8695,I have heard that Singaporeans are somewhat becoming xenophobic and that is worrisome.
8696,I would say that's quite clearly racially-ignorant rather than racist.
8697,Now that's clearly racist.
8698,I guess my point is the boundary of the concepts of race and culture is so blurred that some cases fall in between racial ignorance and vile racism?
8699,"People have been talking about this issue for hundreds of years, but it took the killing of a man in broad daylight with cameras on the cops to shine a light on the true extent of racism and police brutality in America."
8700,"Referring to this, "" i will do my best to rid racism in my day to day life and advocate for it"", how do you go about doing it?"
8701,It highlights the current systemic racism in Singapore.
8702,"The solution is either you have the talents of people mentioned above to communicate a message, or as a normal layman like me and you, we begin by convincing our peers that racism is frowned upon and does exist in Singapore."
8703,"If nothing is happening to the maid, then it fine, but if something is happening then you'd potentially have saved the maids life."
8704,Don't take it too seriously it's not meant to be racist I don't think especially if they treat you as an equal
8705,"Yes I know we have those co-living places here for expats, but curious if there are more alternative spaces?"
8706,"Hey r/Singapore, I was just thinking about racism as a whole and then drifted to racism in the Singaporean context."
8707,"I understand that there is racism in terms of societal outlook (how we look at each other, biases formed from generations of stereotyping) but are there actual policies in place that limit say, minorities or certain races?"
8708,I thought the Predeparture test to Singapore requires a PCR test to board the VTL flight?
8709,I have a couple of questions since ill be heading over when VTL opens  1. i heard there are plans to further ease restrictions by the end of the month b4 the VTL w SG kicks in and with 80% local vaccination rates is that true?
8710,Hey that's racist!
8711,"I guess I was taking issue with the fact that all too often, these perfectly valid criticisms are either labelled as (and this is bad) or actually become breeding grounds for (and this is worse) xenophobia sigh."
8712,It's an easy excuse and should be done away with because the racists/sexists will hide under the veneer of innocent reasons.
8713,"***  ^^^u/BS_MokiMoki34&#32;can&#32;[send&#32;this&#32;message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AnotherCakeDayBot&subject=Remove%20reply%20id:%20fh9pk23&message=For%20reference,%20this%20is%20the%20permalink%20to%20the%20parent%20comment:%20/r/singapore/comments/f213ne/how_can_i_explain_to_friends_that_this_is_racist/fh9pk23/)&#32;to&#32;delete&#32;this&#32;|&#32;View&#32;my&#32;profile&#32;for&#32;more&#32;info&#32;or&#32;PM&#32;to&#32;provide&#32;feedback"
8714,"I definitely agree with you on the point about being a hypocrite but i just wanna say that activism or standing for something is not something that you can only do once you've reached a certain level of ""goodness"" or ""moral perfection"", it is a constant attempt to better yourself and the world around you so I don't think it is fair to downplay the efforts of someone who may well be trying to be better (despite the fact they may have made racist comments in the past/are not as vocal about issues closer to home)."
8715,"Also I understand that I will be treated differently, but I'm just wondering about racism?"
8716,It is very difficult to argue against the impact of racism on our society and how easy it is to find ourselves siding due to our tribal instincts with people of a community due to such a non-factor like race.
8717,Imagine how much more productive we would be if racism just *didn’t exist*... then pull a parallel to how racism doesn’t exist if *everyone was of one skin colour*.
8718,"I believe Mr Lee thought the above, especially after the “rich babies” debacle, that genetically we *were* the same, and to achieve our fullest potential we had to eliminate racism through Public Education a la Racial Harmony."
8719,How do the locals perceive young intern expats?
8720,"######Chinese schools, English language  Lee Kuan Yew describes his education, in English-language schools and then overseas in England, in mixed terms: ""deculturalized,"" textbooks and teachers ""totally unrelated to the world [he] lived in,"" ""a sense of loss at having been educated in a stepmother tongue,"" ""not formally tutored in [his] own Asian culture... not belonging to British culture either, lost between two cultures."""
8721,"In English schools, he mandated the teaching of mother tongues."
8722,The three mother tongues are completely unrelated to English.
8723,"But if we were monolingual in our mother tongues, we would not make a living."
8724,"Hey, don't forget the Indians, especially the foreign workers."
8725,"And various other ethnic groups- my mom is *epic* racist towards Boyanese, and I know a lot of other people on her side of the family are too, so it's not just her."
8726,It is mostly about black expats living in sg.
8727,"No one likes to be called out for racism/xenophobia/toxic behaviour, and what I've noticed on this sub is that whenever someone is calling the other person out for it, there is a flood of downvotes and the person who's calling these negative behaviours out are immediately dismissed as being ""woke"", as if being sensitive to the feelings of others and treating people with kindness and respect is a terrible thing."
8728,"Call out someone else if they're being racists, or uncivil in general."
8729,"I am very sorry that you and your kin continue to face high levels of racism and discrimination here despite slow-growing awareness, hopefully your answers can help shed more light."
8730,"I was on a visit to MOM once, and the manpower officials there sadly admitted that despite their efforts, they simply cannot get the public support or political support needed to give foreign workers the kind of protection they deserve."
8731,"Most of the time MOM officials basically end up to begging or intimidating whenever there's an abuse case, since there is nearly zero legislation out there to defend foreign workers."
8732,"I don't thinkit will solve ""the issue"", because there's no issue to begin with, but perhaps this will stop giving us expats free money everytime locals complain about ""stealing their jobs""."
8733,"Dependency on foreign talent is a consequence of Singapore development, population size, and access to higher levels of education."
8734,"I just bought my VTL tickets to return to SG for one month in Dec, and want to settle all the logistics beforehand."
8735,As an expat I suppose I should expect paying at least $2500-3000 for housing or is this too much/little?
8736,"Hi @paullesq @fijimermaidsg,   1."
8737,I browsed a few campaigns on giving sg but being a semi-recent expat don't have much idea of which are the good charities in Singapore.
8738,"Hi All,  Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true."
8739,"**Tldr:**  * Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability * CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US * If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%  # Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator  When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%."
8740,"Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation."
8741,I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make.
8742,"*  &#x200B;  While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms."
8743,Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?
8744,"Hi All,  Coming around to the end of the year im wondering if anyone had some thoughts around these accounts for expats?"
8745,I see many Singaporeans engaging domestic helpers to look after their kids so that both spouses can go to work.
8746,It is also another added cost to hire a domestic helper.
8747,"While I think the issue of racism is a bit overblown sometimes, I do also feel that it's harder to get dates/respect for someone like me versus if I had a more ""traditional"" American look."
8748,I am an expat from Australia and have been on Zoloft (Sertraline) 200mg each day for a long time.
8749,a) I have read a lot of articles on (subtle) racism against Indians in Singapore.
8750,Maybe some of it is plain-old xenophobia.
8751,I'm an expat so I don't really know what my options are when dealing with a bad landlord.
8752,Hi I'm also a child of low-key racist Chinese parents.
8753,"Doesn't that mean: **for Singaporeans, the cost of living in SG is at least 20 percent higher than that for expats?"
8754,**  So shouldn't the salaries for SG citizens and PRs always be higher than that for expats?
8755,Hi I’m a new expat here from the US.
8756,It’s been really eye opening learning about the treatment of migrant workers during the pandemic.
8757,Hi I’m tired of my boomer parents making crude remarks at foreign workers situation.
8758,"What if the foreign workers get used to the resorts/expo/whatever nicer lodging the Govt is providing to isolate them, as a result, foreign workers will become lazy."
8759,"Also, making a police report against a domestic worker for scolding them??"
8760,"Hi OP, I’m late but I’d like to say thank you so much for speaking up about your experiences and struggles, I know how stifling Singapore’s social norms can be and how much pressure there is to deny that racism exists here and sweep all our social issues under the carpet."
8761,"I’m so sorry you went through such horrible and racist treatment, there is no possible excuse anyone can make to justify how you were treated and I hope your mental health has improved since."
8762,"To all expats and PRs, how many of you will move once you have a boy and realised that your boy has to sacrifice 2 years of his life in the Singapore armed forces?"
8763,I'm not convinced any of these expats are really as concerned about the state of affairs of Singapore as long they continue having a paycheck here.
8764,"Most people in Singapore are not xenophobic, we have the crude racist humour that we all experienced when growing up in the local education system."
8765,We laugh at ourselves when a racists remark is made against us by a fellow Singaporean because we understand what is racial tolerance.
8766,"Hell, we even make the same racists remarks to our friends of the same race!"
8767,"Most of us are not xenophobic, we just don't like it when expats/foreigners behave arrogantly or think they are a class above us."
8768,"At the end of the day, Singaporeans don't owe expats or foreigners anything."
8769,"For every expat that comes here, I'm sure you know there will be thousands more expats/foreigners who are more qualified then you to take the job."
8770,But a single expat has much lesser consideration than your average Singaporean.
8771,"frankly the agents don't like it either, it makes their job harder and they would be able to make commission faster if no racist landlords exist."
8772,one of our engineers bitterly joke that perhaps the only way is to wait for all the racist landlords to die and and the keys to their children who are hopefully less racist.
8773,"1) just to make sure, did you turn on the ""diversity friendly"" filter (it's under ""More filters"" when you search for listings) to look for listings that are explicitly stated as non-racist?"
8774,"(if despite being explicitly ""diversity friendly"", they are still actually still secretly racist, pls do report and let us know, we will absolutely kick those listings off the platform)  2) if you are still having trouble, i am not sure what we can do but perhaps u can email me and our team will do everything we can to help."
8775,"While on the other hand, i still have friends that are posting about how BLM on social media, just to revert back to their racist self on personal interactions."
8776,Calling it “tolerant racism”  or “causal racism “ isn’t something that should be accepted.
8777,"(This is obviously a joke, my female friends are messier than me)  So yea, give us time I mean we are only 49 and do not have a long heritage, we have pockets of individuals like you have in Europe who are racist (UKIP , National Front, EDL, etc)."
8778,So I've been here on an employment pass for a few months and I'm starting to get worried about my company's HR practices.
8779,"My income on my employment pass was stated as a few hundred dollars more than what I'm actually earning, but other people working here earn half what MoM thinks they do."
8780,"Due to doxxing rules, I can't really say which company and who she is but I did my research and according to my friend, she's a real piece of work  * Her foreign domestic worker / maid goes to her office to perform cleaning duties in the office * She has a chauffeur that also doubles as the receptionist of her office * When she fired the tea lady, she made the Pinoy IT guy the tea lady instead."
8781,Her maid would then pack a plate for her own consumption.
8782,"Left-overs are packed again for her own maids (Yeah, more than one)."
8783,"When the maids say that the food is spoiled after a few days, she tells them too bad, she has taken care of their meals * She repeated berates employees and demeans them to carry out menial tasks * Commission scheme was changed within a day because an employee made too much sales * The business relies on 100% government subsidy but she still charges unsuspecting clients * The turnover is insanely high, at least one employee a week * Employee job scopes are fluid and often people perform multiple jobs week to week."
8784,"-A few adverts have ""Singaporean only"" specified, is this due to economic incentives for employing singaporeans, or because foreign immigrants are undesirable."
8785,I am potentially moving to Singapore permanently for work and I was wondering what I should know about tax in Singapore as an expat?
8786,They are asking for 2000 kits so that they can get the migrant workers to take the ART test before going on the Flyer.
8787,"Hi all,  Full disclosure, I’m a late-20s expat from the U.S. about 1.5 years into living in Singapore."
8788,Issue:   Within a short span of 3 days (if my memory doesnt fail me) the neighbour's maid decided to put their clothing in front of my family's plants (near the staircase).
8789,"My family members have tried to tell their maid not to put their clothing in front of their house but to be fair, she helps the neighbours, she doesnt decide so she couldnt help much."
8790,"Hi all,  I'm a UK expat and as such have an EU BattleNet account."
8791,"They are not on work permit, social pass or employment pass."
8792,"Hi all, I lived in Singapore for some time and I published some blog articles about living, partying and working in Singapore here: http://expatssingapore.wordpress.com Maybe it helps."
8793,"Hi all,     The mods have discussed feedback and possible actions regarding the CECA keyword filter, and we will be making some changes."
8794,"***Origin of the filter***   The filter was first put in place on a one week trial basis in November 2020 during a period when we were removing almost all comments with the word CECA in it, among other derogatory terms that were made out of pure racism and did not add anything to the discussions."
8795,***Actions taken by mods***   The filter applied a blanket removal to all posts and comments containing the word 'CECA'.
8796,"**Comments will no longer be removed, and posts regarding CECA will be filtered for manually approval for now, subject to changes as time passes."
8797,"Hi all, I'm an American expat living in Singapore."
8798,Do you guys have personal tips on saving money as an expat?
8799,"Bloggers tend to be too optimistic, so I'd like to ask from the locals or other fellow expats."
8800,My company does not help me very much and my budget would be quite small (compared to most of the expats I see on here).
8801,"Hi all, do any expats have uk or Irish TV  in their homes here in Singapore?"
8802,Racism and xenophobia are very complex issues.
8803,"I guess the point I'm trying to drive home (if I had one), is that we're all in this sub together and I hope we all have the same stake in preventing it from becoming a cesspool of not just racism or xenophobia, but also toxicity."
8804,On a VTL flight back to Singapore on 8jan.
8805,"Hi all,Just a quick question, mostly directed at employers/expats/people who've recently moved to SG."
8806,"I would like to add that, it's not that I am xenophobic, I am more concern about the depressing wages faced by many people."
8807,"Just wondering if any expats here have come here with one company, and moved to another company."
8808,Were you able to keep any of your expat benefits/package or once you're here will you be given local terms and conditions?
8809,I am going on an expat assignment with my family.
8810,"I'm hoping Singapore will have a good expat community, decent night life and lots of things to do."
8811,Is it a good place to live for a young expat?
8812,My understanding is that travel is allowed between VTL countries before embarking on flight back to Singapore on designated VTL flight.
8813,Question 1: Could the KL VTL be used as a gateway to gain access to Singapore from other VTL countries?
8814,For example some of the VTL assigned flights from Europe are fully booked.
8815,"Question 2: If one was traveling to Europe, how can Singapore detect if the traveller has crossed the borders between VTL and non VTL countries?"
8816,"My main concerns are with pricing, I have heard (mostly unverified) opinions that many expats and foreigners are leaving SG, and this may lead to oversupply of apartments so the price may fall."
8817,"With the three week quarantine, things shutting down, and racist reportings, I'm worried I made the wrong choice."
8818,Edit: I apologize for giving the wrong impression about my concern for racism.
8819,"I just meant that I've seen a lot of postings on this subreddit about racism in Singapore lately, and that coupled with other mixed feelings about the move, made me feel a certain way."
8820,I am currently working in japan(expat) but the taxes are insane and work enviornment is shitty.
8821,The foreign workers are being tested cause there’s many clusters at the dorms.
8822,"As in my opinion, the system is really good to provide everyone with equal opportunities, in other words, there is no systemic racism but interpersonal racism (bigotry)."
8823,"You racist is it?"""
8824,Can some other American expats give me some advice?
8825,Obviously for those without maids.
8826,Give it a listen if you're interested of a first hand account of an African American man living through multiple racism incidents.
8827,"A lot of my expat friends all think Tian Tian is heavenly, and I’m inclined to agree to a certain extent."
8828,I just don't want to be ripped off (even though company is paying for it) like I've been reading in some expat forums.
8829,"Specifically, I have four questions:  First, renting: I've heard that some Singaporean landlords are racist and refuse to rent to Indians."
8830,"One more thing: Is it true that if you do not have a mother tongue, you will not be able to go to a junior college?"
8831,Is there something I can do to help her with me on my employment pass?
8832,"He's a graduate from a great uni, well spoken, immaculately dressed social guy whose lived in multiple countries and his expat package is probably higher than 90% of the locals."
8833,I suppose the realtor agencies are at the mercy of the landlords and can't do anything if the landlord is prejudiced or racist.
8834,"Surely, there must be laws against this because such overt racism with written proof in the west would be an invitation for legal action."
8835,I've been getting a bunch of job enquiries from Singapore and I've been declining them all on account of this (i even openly tell them that racism from the locals is my main concern).
8836,Is my friend an extremely unlucky person or is this kind of xenophobia totally normal and accepted over there?
8837,"Surely, only the economy of Singapore will suffer more if expats refuse to migrate there if word gets out it's an unwelcoming place."
8838,"Before it was approved, it showed that the pass type of employment pass was pending."
8839,"- I wonder if I am under under qualified for an employment pass, since I only have 1 year of working experience and maybe my salary is not high enough?"
8840,"So my question to the Singaporean redditors, especially the expats browsing here, is what are my next steps?"
8841,Can I reapply for the employment pass a few months down the road?
8842,"Hi guys, sorry for posting this here, but I'm in desperate need of help as I'm seeking for a bank account that I could open with an employment pass IPA."
8843,So I'm a foreign worker in sg.
8844,"I have learnt that cannabis was made illegal in the US due to misinformation, corporate interest, yellow journalism and racism."
8845,I do think everybody is a little bit racist (Google: Everybody's a little racist by Avenue Q).
8846,"But a small hint of racism leaves a chance for ""big"" racism to grow, such as making general assumptions about a whole race."
8847,"We would love to feature communities such as the elderly, maids or forgotten groups of people."
8848,"Hi r/sg,  &#x200B;  The post on SAP schools ([https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bwn0bv/as\_long\_as\_sap\_schools\_exist\_chinese\_elitism\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bwn0bv/as_long_as_sap_schools_exist_chinese_elitism_in/)) piqued my curiosity re: CMIO groupings in SG and MY."
8849,"I understand that the groups might have been more segregated before and it easy to point out who belonged where, but doesn't formalising it just legalise racism and stereotyping?"
8850,Some of you have mentioned that CMIO is becoming less relevant now.
8851,"My race should then be Chinese, but I don't fit the ""standard description"" of what an ethnic Chinese in Singapore would be -- I don't even consider Mandarin as my mother tongue."
8852,"Hi r/sg,  Due to travel restrictions to Australia, I was wondering if anyone here has deferred their overseas studies until they could return to campus."
8853,"Hi r/singapore,   we are an expat couple who moved out of Singapore last week and left the security deposit with the landlord in good faith thinking it would be returned in 14 days after the contract."
8854,"Anyway I need some advice on how to read, write and speak chinese because recently I feel very ashamed on not being able to speak my own mother tongue."
8855,I specifically want to donate to the migrant workers so I guess Klook is the only option.
8856,I got in touch with an organisation that donates to foreign workers but they were not interested in what we have.
8857,"However, I highly doubt that you will ever face any kind of overt racism, or racist remarks."
8858,"Hi there, American expat posted to Singapore itching to go shooting."
8859,"Hi there, coz of my poly project many years back, I have been to those shophouses in Little India, Farrer Park that was converted into living dorms for foreign workers and we interviewed them too."
8860,"There were one foreign worker in charge of meal at the time, preparing meals for everyone (they all were given a role in the dorm) the quality of the food was subpar, for example vegetable was full of holes and yellowish and eggs were already past the expiration date."
8861,I told myself after seeing the living condition of shophouses converted dorms that I took many things for granted and really respected these foreign workers even more.
8862,"Hi there, i need to help my foreign domestic worker to fill in some information."
8863,"Some expats may complain that clothing, shoes and condom sizes here in Asia are too ""small""."
8864,Singapore also has many expat forums that would help give you advice regarding integration.
8865,"If you find after reading them, that you are moved to speak on behalf of migrant workers, then that is you responding to their stories, not to a leftist agenda."
8866,"But I think since you served NS, you should have a higher chance of getting citizenship (my family is an immigrant family with 2 daughters, so no one did NS)."
8867,"In light of the recent VTL, I figured there might be many considering trips to Korea but might be hesitant because they’re not sure about how the situation is in Seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved."
8868,How do I make that happen with VTL?
8869,"So for context, my neighbours maid have been taking their dog for walks and according to her from my mum, that the owner told her to come outside my house to poop."
8870,I have met some expats but they fit quite neatly into one bucket or another whereas I want to explore all sorts of different things instead of just bar hopping or just eating out.
8871,"as there are foreigner/immigrants from all over asia, do Bangladeshis get along with people from other countries?"
8872,"Hi,  Actually Singapore is home to many expats from all parts of the world."
8873,I thought my expat friends should know about this!
8874,"Hi,  I am in town for a few days and want to know if there are any expat cricket leagues in Singapore I can play in this week."
8875,"getting good money, but i am from east Asia, so getting tired of being too far away from family and all the visa issues and racism issue here."
8876,Can someone explain the current travel restrictions on leaving Singapore for nonessential travel?
8877,"Hi,  The latest travel restriction states that travelers who had traveled to mainland China or hold a PRC passport will not be allowed entry to Singapore."
8878,"Hi,   I may have the chance to become an expat and live in Singapore for a couple of months."
8879,I'm fully vaccinated but Thailand is definitely not on the VTL list right now and I suspect it wont be anytime soon.
8880,My only concern is that I got vaccinated in a non VTL country (Thailand) initially?
8881,"Hi, 37m expat looking to get a regular group together for go karting over the weekends."
8882,"Regardless though, I’m just looking for people interested (local/expat welcome) to just get together to kart casually every now and then."
8883,"Hi, I am a new expat."
8884,e.g racists who choose not to have indian tenants gets downvoted
8885,**Retirement in Singapore** is more affordable due to **lower healthcare and domestic helper costs**.
8886,"Hi, I posted not really bc of this CECA issue but your comment resonated with me due to what happened in my personal life."
8887,"Btw, having a strong and sustainable (meaning future generations also have to take part) blue collared work force will reduce our reliance on foreign workers."
8888,"I’m talking about racism in Singapore in general, based off personal experiences and accounts of others."
8889,"How many incidences have we seen, on reddit alone, that point towards racism one way or another?"
8890,There are few buses popular with Indian workers at Jurong East and I’ve seen rather subtle acts of racism by fellow Singaporeans taking the bus.
8891,To claim that racism doesn’t exist in Singapore is blatant ignorance.
8892,"As they say, racism stems from the majority."
8893,I do not identify myself as an expat in Singapore (I will always recognize myself as a Singaporean in Sg and Australia)
8894,Somewhere like Holland Village is a 25 minute ride away from Labrador Park and is popular with expats as well.
8895,"African American expats are not as common as white expats, so locals might do a double take when they see you on the train or something but I wouldn't worry about it."
8896,"But I'd like to pose a question, Do you guys think is subconsciously racist?"
8897,There's lots of things to nitpick about the VTL but for one i am lucky for the chance to be able to travel once again.
8898,Even a small positive change of attitude means a lot in a thankless world with so much hate for immigrants (gdi trump).
8899,"Hi, thank for this informative post I’m going to South Korea via VTL soon."
8900,"I did not say all students who attend SAP schools are racist, just that the existence of SAP schools means that minority students do not have equal opportunity in Singapore."
8901,"I don't really understand how more Chinese immigrants in our workplaces and universities is really a problem, as you mentioned."
8902,My opinion is based from experiences going into specifically built dormitory buildings and facilities and interacting with foreign workers residing in them such as westlite at toh guan.
8903,I understand that my experiences should not be generalised to all but I believe what you mentioned is the minority and such treatment of foreign workers should be eradicated.
8904,"Highlighting that if even someone as privileged as her is running into racism, imagine what a normal person has to go through?"
8905,Imagine what an Indian person or migrant worker has to go through.
8906,"Construction workers experience even more risks when working considering that construction companies cut corners and sometimes compromise their worker’s safety for extra profits or to save costs, much more worse than maids, but both cases still needs to be addressed."
8907,Hire a maid to do house chores.
8908,Hiring a maid to do house chores and care for children is not being smart but being cheap.
8909,Do believe that there are many people similar to me that can get hired in the same role but they chose to hire expats.
8910,Hiring FDW is dirt cheap than hiring a professional cleaning company.
8911,"FDW can clean the house, cook the food, care for the kids, do the groceries, etc."
8912,"We used to have a maid(4 maids,2 years max) when i was young.1st maid was sent back because her mom was ill,so she wanted to go back.2nd maid was sent back to agency because she couldn't do a basic job & always hanging out with other maids during working hours.3rd & 4th maid is really such a good worker.1 of them can cook like restaurants food.Sadly both of them also left for different reason."
8913,Hiring a maid means you have to train her as well.
8914,Oh in general the whole maid thing is so stupid.
8915,"After spending days on end looking and going through sub-par local resumes, I am forced to look for foreign workers that actually had the skills I was looking for."
8916,"See, no need at all for any sort of racism narrative."
8917,"Tolerance and inclusion of of race, religion, ideas and immigrants is not about building bridges and taking care of people's feelings."
8918,His first point was about the explosion of cases due to the spread within the migrant worker community.
8919,His point is that not wanting FW dorms near one’s residence doesn’t automatically make one a racist.
8920,His post sounds very similar to a piece of news that appeared some time back about this woman whose maid quit.
8921,"If he is racist, he is losing business."
8922,The migrant workers who reside in dorms were pretty much locked up the whole time since the outbreak started last year.
8923,Hitting maid?
8924,"BLM (btw apparently the founder of BLM is somehow rich now and buying $millions in properties) supporters saying anti-Asian racism is fake, all lives don’t matter till black lives matter, Asians are in fact the most racist, excusing violent black on Asian hate crimes etc."
8925,Or idealistic commoners who think a maid earning less than they did can somehow pay that back.
8926,"Or at least, that's how the megaracist people I know think about both groups."
8927,"Hm... Indigenous people may beg to differ, but maybe you just mean anti-Asian racism"
8928,"A)Yes, racism has no place in society  B) property however is in a unique position."
8929,"If, say, the maid's employment term is not yet concluded, I'm not sure the employer should be held hostage by the maid's sudden (if so) impulse to up and leave."
8930,"Unlike the VTL to Germany where you merely need to clear a PCR test if you are from a third country classified as lower risk, it seems the VTL to South Korea cannot be used as an alternative to avoid SHN from a third country, since South Korea is still closed to most visitors for now (as in still need to quarantine for 14 days)."
8931,Hmm if i say later kena brand racist.
8932,In fact the migrant workers in the dorms are still not allowed out to mingle with the larger community
8933,"But your example about making racial jokes could be borderline racist to the majority of minorities, especially with the situation now."
8934,Hmm no further details on whether Indo VTL only applies to JKT or Riau or Bali or all 3?
8935,🤣🤣🤣 TLDR racism is OK as long as its against foreigners eh?
8936,"They're not trying to be racist, but it does feel bad."
8937,"I would say that if there was racism at play, it's not intentional."
8938,I've met plenty of racist scumbags in my life.
8939,"Hmm, for me, immigrants implies an intention to stay, while expatriates doesn't."
8940,"On top of that, expatriates tends to be used for white-collar professionals."
8941,"If you were to use the term expat for both non-white and white professionals, I would imagine there isn't implied racism."
8942,"Alternatively, is there a blanket term for non-white collar foreign workers?"
8943,"Hmm, i may know someone who needs a new FDW."
8944,"If you ever have more into on this, please link me since I find this very difficult to grasp, it makes as much sense to me as Americans hating on immigrants for taking high paying jobs and dropping the wage of the low income jobs too."
8945,"And all over the world, low wage jobs have historically been taken by immigrants from poor countries driving the price down."
8946,Most of the expats in Singapore are experienced before Singapore.
8947,"Hmm, no mention of his racism?"
8948,"By that definition, it is racism."
8949,"In Singapore though, where racializing (both positively and negatively) is very normalized in Singaporean society, the goalposts for racism are slightly different - there is more emphasis on how much a racialized interaction affects your quality of life negatively."
8950,"Other elite schools might rise up and exclusivity might always be an issue but I find it quite funny that you think abolishing SAP schools, which only offer Chinese as a mother tongue which affects the students that go there obviously, will make a very marginal impact on ethnic relations."
8951,"Hmm,I am new here,and may not know much,but the thing is,I would agree with Synco - Singaporeans have no right to be racist or xenophobic if they do nothing politically."
8952,"Yes,the internet has been rife with xenophobic comments and such,presumably because of the 'anonymity clause' -i.e."
8953,But I think PSLE level mother tongue is generally game-able with brute force practice.
8954,I think it's not explicit in terms of racism but it does provoke the sense that they don't belong in Singapore.
8955,"By the way, the only reports of deaths in the protests is one Black man shot by the police, and one Black kid shot by a white racist bar-owner (who won't be facing charges, either, accdg to Omaha officials)."
8956,"Lmao, it's one thing to defend the police and the response to the protests, because yeah I agree that there are opportunistic looters (I just disagree that their existence delegitimizes the movement as a whole and warrants the excessive response from the police and military), but you're denying institutional racism exists too?"
8957,"I guess the racism aspect could play a role, but I don’t think it was the main driver."
8958,"That said, the dorms can be better maintained and food for the migrant workers catered by the dorms need to be better"
8959,"Hmmm with migrant workers and FDW, my concern would be if they are citizens and are working in the same role, how would they be able to support themselves and their families in Singapore given the wages they earn"
8960,Hmmm yeah but if you look at places like Dubai - global hubs - I suspect they’re not seeing expats leave the same way SG is.
8961,"My usual refrain is that these foreign workers are subsidising our growth, and that hiring live-in maids in advanced countries usually costs thousands a month."
8962,Never did think expats are looking to put down roots here or at least the ones I know.
8963,"Lately MSM lotsa ""shaping perceptions"" campaigns on ft/immigrant integration."
8964,Hmmmm I think most of us here haven’t considered the other aspects of coming here to work as an FDW.
8965,"Like Ghostofwinter88 I’ve spoken to (many) maids before and am aware (from reading and observation) of the spectrum of how badly (abuse cases, even death) to how well they can be treated (like family, such that years and even decades after being employed here they come back for a holiday to reunite with their ex-employers turned friends)."
8966,"However FDW roles here, aren’t supposed to be ‘I’m going to get my money’s worth and make sure she is busy all hours of the day."
8967,This is why it’s so easy for people to assume that a maid who wakes at 6am and finishes washing the dishes at 8pm to have been working 14 hours a day and is therefore overworked.
8968,But have you actually had a maid live in with you?
8969,"This is but one average example and everyone is different, but as you can see the way the FDW spends her day is busy but not supposed to be stressful mentally to the point of exhaustion."
8970,Groceries are dependent on if there is a list by the employers or if it’s free for all and decided by the FDW (in which case mental load is on her.)
8971,"It’s different of course, depending on if the FDW is there more for housekeeping, or taking care of kids, or one of the tougher ones with higher mental load and physical load, taking care of the elderly."
8972,"You may see them waking from 5am plus and finishing up the chores at 8-9pm, but understand that what you don’t see is that it’s not a full on every minute being efficient kind of environment (it’s not supposed to be, if you see a family pushing their FDW this way, they’re being wrong about things)."
8973,"I’m not saying the FDW doesn’t work as hard, I’m saying they actually have a different, more spread out role in many cases."
8974,Unless you are racist or sex predator what's the problem with the issues she raised ?
8975,"Only in very rare instances will there be an employer that brings a maid abroad which costs at least airfare, lodging and food and then let them explore a foreign place freely."
8976,OTOH most well treated maids would opt to help out during the trip also.
8977,I'm always hoping our maid can see that we are trying to give her the best treatment we can even though sometimes we slip up.
8978,Hope those kids are put into foster care immediately and this couple indicted severely... racist and violent to the max.
8979,"Mr Tan with all due respect has some serious elderly privilege mentality and my only concern is that due to his fees being the most affordable, its attracting lots of foreign workers and I've also seen them being racially abused by him."
8980,"And AhNeh means ""bro"" btw Jesus Christ it's not racist it's like how we go hey bro come here."
8981,"All these populist measures only hurt your economy, with the recent drop in population and expats you're only losing talent"
8982,"Even with government supported agencies using means testing I believe they are pricey, so much cheaper to have a live in FDW who can't ask for time off easily."
8983,Our country needs to eventually ramp up on home help/ nursing services rather than try to rely on thinly trained FDWs who may not have caregiver aptitude or inclination.
8984,Even in many other countries home help nurses or nursing aides are typically foreign workers as locals do not desire such jobs.
8985,There's no easy way out from our dependence on FDWs unless robots eventually step in.
8986,Honest question - who has brigaded us before on topics of racism?
8987,There is a fine line to toe between being racist and targeted advertising.
8988,"Frankly, as much as we talk shit and laugh at racism in Western countries, I swear Asians are just as bad or worse, except Asia never had the whole slavery arc to our racism so it does not sting as profoundly."
8989,An interesting addition to this would be the unspoken fact that immigrants to Singapore carry their racism with them as well.
8990,There could very well be countervailing forces pulling against racial harmony as we get more immigrants with their own cultural baggage in Singapore.
8991,"Case in point, most Chinese citizens from China had never seen someone black in their entire life, so you could hear some of the most innocuous racist shit in China forums about Indians that gets thousands of upvotes."
8992,"Honestly I don't think the label matters, I treat my family maid(18yrs here) well and she refers to herself as a maid anyway."
8993,"But I realize that these days when I talk to other people and say ""my maid"" instead of ""my helper"", people look at me as if I'm non-combustible trash, so I cave in and address my maid as ""helper"" instead, screw PC culture seriously"
8994,Honestly I think people looks for racism or attribute everything to racism sometimes.
8995,"Many of them warned me that Australians are racists, this was the Pauline Hanson era where she stirring shit too."
8996,"The same Australian girl, my classmate who is one of my best friend was branded racist by other Asian classmates."
8997,"But I do feel each foreign worker needs double the portions they are receiving, as the quantity is quite sad for the kind of work they do, which is more physical."
8998,"Honestly from what I have observed, even non-foreign worker Bangladeshis and Indians have great game IRL."
8999,Honestly i am shocked to know that people treat their dosmetic workers this badly because my friends' maids are all treated like family (or else break friendship LOL).
9000,Honestly if the maid report then action is taken.
9001,Maid has to leave so in effect maid also get punished.
9002,Only time this gets reported is if maid got nothing else to lose or if really dulan the employer.
9003,Alternately could offer incentive to maid for reporting (50% of the fine  and 20% of all wages to end of contract?).
9004,"If he was xenophobic he would be against all foreigners (from China, India, Malaysia, etc)."
9005,Honestly its sickening the way people treat maids as commodities.
9006,"The prevailing sense I get from some of these cases is that because they paid for the maid, they can use her however (wash other relatives houses, work in the shop) or they can treat them however they like (restrict food, restrict weekends etc.)."
9007,"Fortunately, most people aren't complete assholes, but when Shrey does something like this, insinuating that the Chinese population at large is racist and discriminatory, of course people--even the good ones-- are going to get incensed."
9008,Yeah some of the older generation (think those who went through WWII) in Singapore treat maids like trash but if your parents are doing so as well it's your responsibility to get them to stop if they have any shred of decency left in their bodies.
9009,I've told some of my aunts off for treating my maid badly when they're visiting.
9010,"My maid knows my family treats her well, and she treats my family well in return."
9011,"Your grandma needs help from your maid, and your maid is being treated badly not only by your grandma but your parents as well."
9012,"If something were to happen to your grandma (touch wood), would your maid do everything in her ability to save her or would she be like ""ehhh...""?"
9013,"Honestly speaking, I have not met a single expat in my ""group"" (around 140 people) who is supportive of the current restrictions, despite we abide and respect them."
9014,"And it has been like this for, at least 10 to 15 years, I am not sure to which type of expats the article is referring to, maybe the same one who earns ""30-40.000SGD a month"" that many EDMWers refers to."
9015,"\- So far (but seems this will be removed) group sports are still not allowed (you cannot play football, futsal, basketball, etc..)   \- There is an increasing xenophobic mentality - it was always here, but it is not getting worrying."
9016,Like the lie about the CECA treaty which was (and still is) rampant online for years.
9017,Seeing the racist comments on here breaks my heart.
9018,"If it really was not about race, he would also look at other FTA and how they affect our work force and not just focus on CECA."
9019,Honestly you have no idea how racist singaporeans are.
9020,"Those people are so racist, but also so insecure and jealous."
9021,"Singaporeans are racist, extremely insecure and jealous people"
9022,I’ve heard stories from friends and family about really self-entitled maids who wilfully break reasonable and clearly stated house rules (eg.
9023,"I know influencers are an easy target and frankly I don’t think very highly of them too, but in this case I genuinely feel that the maid is predominantly in the wrong."
9024,"It seems better placed for her to have put this on a private account, especially since people who don’t read through properly may just be compelled to disrespect maids even more."
9025,"There are two major culprits here - the agent and the employer, and such incidents speak volumes about how insufficient our labour laws are with regards to foreign workers."
9026,"Also, most of these cases end up being settled with the foreign worker not receiving the full compensation deserved."
9027,"You have reports like this of employees getting abused, of injured employees getting delayed treatments while employers find a way to circumvent the Work Injury Compensation Act, of foreign workers being made to work more than 80 hours a week (this is actually very common, 12 hours a day for 6/7 days a week), and even of cases where employers hire 'legal gangster' to forcibly repatriate workers who report such injustices."
9028,"Honestly, I don't know why these people are complaining about having to wait for 2 more weeks to book vaccination as expats."
9029,"""If you see a group of malays,  walk the other way, it might seem odd or racist at first but it's better safe than sorry""."
9030,"Honestly, I hope that people realize that when you employ a domestic helper, they are hiring a proper person, not a slave nor a robot."
9031,"But once you put yourself in their shoes, having to bear with things day-in and day-out, you realize that the reason we are hearing more complaints these days is really not because the casually racist things we do used to be okay."
9032,"Isn't it ironic that a comic scolding us for xenophobia, depicts 'white people' as the mascot of *America*?"
9033,"Honestly, if any expat gives you an ""oh"" kind of reaction then I wouldn't really take them seriously."
9034,"I had a firm understanding about the HDB system within one week of living in Singapore (because it's fascinating) and in four years I have only met one person who would have looked down on me for living in an HDB... but she didn't know what chicken rice was and believed ""all Singaporeans say hello to each other with a kiss on both cheeks"" (she only hung out with French expats)."
9035,"Honestly, nothing in the story suggested racism besides the races of the people involved."
9036,"SJWs often argue such racist hiring is limited, so do the comments above represent all singaporeans?"
9037,"Honestly, there's been a lot of justified backlash regarding this ferrying of migrant workers on back of lorries thing."
9038,">However, she said that there could be higher costs incurred and other practical challenges to face, if construction workers were ferried in buses rather than lorries, and that more regulation will cause ""acute pain"" to the industry  If that's such a big hurdle, then is there nth that can be done abt it such that we rather just let migrant workers continue being ferried around like this?"
9039,"Honestly, this case seems to be just a misunderstanding between the malay woman and the employee, well yes the employee said that the waffles alr sold out and the malay woman did understand but the main issue is that you couldn't just blatantly say that the employee is racist just because the man received the waffle after you were told that the waffles were sold out, it could be that the man ordered the waffles first and waited for a few good minutes before coming back and picking up the waffles he had just ordered"
9040,Why would anyone chose to potentially lose a customer and prospective revenue just for the sake of racism?
9041,"As long as the guy is not a dick (or in your case, spotted dicks amiright) I'm fine with expats."
9042,"Honestly, you'll see foreign talent angmohs paid more than the average local here because only the high-salary ones move."
9043,Relatively low-education/low pay/low social capital people tend not to become white-collar expats.
9044,In angmohland it's the same; the average SGean (or whatever country) expat earns far more than the average local and there's no end of angmoh locals complaining about it.
9045,FDWs are always going to be a thing.
9046,Who here is surprised that classism and racism is so blatant?
9047,"Yet, the systematic racism persists, even against working Indian couples who are at their jobs like 80% of the day and have no possible time for cooking."
9048,"I'm not saying you are racist like that, just that these generalizations are where it goes wrong very easily."
9049,"But if the minor possibility of an inconvenience of a few days at the end of a rental term to repaint the apartment is still reason enough to exclude an entire race of people from your apartment, how do I not call this behavior racist?"
9050,Even expats here don’t mind getting a maid because “everyone has one and they are  cheap”.
9051,Is it just strict border measures or what are the other differing strategies that has allowed HK to pursue more relaxed measures that produce less fatigue for its residents compared to us?
9052,"But within the fence, tons of foreign workers became the sacrificial lambs (but they are young and hardly any died)."
9053,Hope no uturn on the VTL decisions
9054,"Hope people who went to jail for being racist should go through some ""racial harmony"" course"
9055,Hopefully VTL cover both air and land connections
9056,Hopefully more ASEAN VTLs and India VTL are formed
9057,"Hopefully newer generations of Singaporeans can actually start to embrace other races and recognize that racism is just bad for everyone, including themselves."
9058,Hopefully that maid gets canned and the trash agency gets shut down
9059,Hopefully the covid crisis becomes a wake up call for the govt to act on the migrant workers’ living conditions.
9060,Another idea is to get Singapore households who can to adopt a healthy migrant worker at home each.
9061,Life for these migrant workers has been brutal these last two years.
9062,Hoping to get some quick advice from any American expats who may be able to help provide some context/thoughts/opinions on my current situation.
9063,"When I was child in Nigeria, the maid my parents hired was stunned that I would refer to her with respect."
9064,There's a lot of inhumane treatment going on in the maid circles and our maid actually told us that my father was the first employer who didn't try to touch her.
9065,I'd say treating maids as subhuman is a problem pretty much everywhere this type of work is available
9066,"An industry that runs on either very young (interns and part timers), very old (those who can't find better jobs) or foreign workers (who cannot easily change jobs), where hotels can pay lowly and still overwork these people."
9067,If the employer marries the FDW then there's no issue.
9068,Let her experience what she did to her maid.
9069,"How about domestic helper employers have ""employee happiness index"" KPI too?"
9070,"Also have the employers sign a contract in the event they are found guilty of abusing the maids, not only they have to face the law, but they have to compensate the maid financially (large penalty)."
9071,"How about her own home country, racism towards chinese, i wonder how issit."
9072,"How about my friend posted a video of someone singing CNY song and then write ""Ching Chong song""  Is that racist?"
9073,I agree that “no Chinese” just like that is racist too
9074,How about people stop being lazy and stop hiring maids?
9075,I doubt it's much of a necessity for both parents (for those who can afford a maid) to work in order to sustain.
9076,One of then should be a stay at home parent   Singapore should ban hiring maids because Singaporeans love to maximise their cost-benefit.
9077,I have a neighbour whose maid has to clean the corridoor everyday although HDB already has a specific cleaner to do that.
9078,How about she goes the to deceased family and serve as a maid for them for the rest of her life?
9079,"Or you know,.. maybe if the gov finally try to solve the racism issue, instead of denying that the problem existed, then we might be rid of issues like this?"
9080,Employers don't need even more leverage over maids.
9081,How about we discuss current racism issues and acknowledge it instead of making more censorship?
9082,but yeah lets discuss racism more openly now!
9083,How about we lift china's travel restriction first?
9084,"If the Chinese were the ones who specifically gave out smaller portions to minorities instead, I am pretty damn sure it'll be labelled as racism and a huge outcry will ensue."
9085,How are people racist tho?
9086,How are you going to catch all racists?
9087,What is standard of racism?
9088,CECA has nothing to do with the current issue and the disillusionment is mostly amongst working class caused by shifts due to technology and offshoring.
9089,This is a global trend  I bet nobody commenting here is from IT or banking and compete in that space  Anger against CECA is a misdirected fury   The cultural arguments (indians are this and that) are just racist comments under veil because it is prejudging the whole race based on a few.
9090,How can a minority race be racist towards the majority you tell me?
9091,Explain to me how racism works in your opinion.
9092,How can racism in any way help multi racialism?
9093,I think growing up the minority races are so used to racist jokes and remarks they've gotten used to it.
9094,"Come on, racist jokes are not funny anymore."
9095,Do you even know that you can limit Wifi access time to maids or guests?
9096,"How can you be so sure that maid abuse has everything to do with racism, and not other mental/physiological issue with the abuser?"
9097,Is the employer abusing the maid solely because of her race?
9098,"If someone mentions race without any intention of hate or superiority, is that still racism?"
9099,"If you say ""I will not date a Malay"" is racist,  How about  I will not date a Malay simply because I do not want to convert into Islam if we eventually have to marry."
9100,Is that still racist?
9101,How can you describe this issue as systemic racism when race is not a criteria to enter SAP schools?
9102,How can you say that this post is racist towards Chinese people when this country is literally filled with Chinese people?
9103,"This post doesn't frame all Chinese people in a negative light, this post is pointing at those racist Chinese people and asking the rest of the Chinese population for help to voice out their disgust."
9104,"If you never read the entire thing and just blatantly say that OP is racist towards Chinese people, you're part of the problem why racism EXIST in Singapore and why it's getting worse."
9105,"How come for such maid assault, the odds that women doing it are higher?"
9106,How come the whole article I cannot find information that the maid's owed salary was paid... or does her salary come out from the $14k fine?
9107,How dare mediacorpse shows an accurate depiction of sinkies racist mentality against foreign workers?!
9108,"A few of my friends who came in via VTL all praised the well organized, super fast testing in Changi"
9109,How did she justify using chingchong as not racist.
9110,There have been so many anecdotal stories of expats leaving both here and on TikTok already.
9111,"I assume it doesnt, they just looked at a person and said “nope, give me someone that looks <blah blah> because i assume they studied in <blah blah>”  Which is racist because of the assumption of the nurse’ certifications based on their face."
9112,How do Filipinos who are FDWs refer to their job?
9113,"I'm not sure of the profile of the foreign workers here, but I get the feeling that graduates are probably not uncommon, based on an encounter I had a long time back."
9114,"Remember, there was nothing racist on the rental advertisements."
9115,How do you define racism?
9116,Is it seeing another race as inferior/superior or does the simple acknowledgement of physical/cultural differences constitute as racism.
9117,"It is a norm for the Chinese in Singapore to call a fairer/tanner Chinese friend xiao bai (little white) or xiao hei(little black) too, does this make them racist against Chinese?"
9118,"If foreigners come to Singapore expecting Singaporeans to conform to their culture, maybe they are the racist ones."
9119,"Also, why do you find describing someone as black being racist, is being black an inferior trait to you?"
9120,Most condos have a separate toilet for the maids ?
9121,Most places maids do not have aircon.
9122,How do you know he’s a migrant worker.
9123,"As a recent recipient of either one, I do agree that the vetting process is flawed and in urgent need of an improvement, but I don’t think an English language test is what it really needs."
9124,Many foreign workers actually don’t live in dorms.
9125,How do you know they were brought over on CECA?
9126,How do you know those 'woke' ones are mistreating these maids?
9127,Quiz everyone if they're racist?
9128,This couple should be barred from having a maid in future TBH.
9129,Or maybe Singapore can follow some European nations to impose better rights for unskilled foreign workers.
9130,How does it prevent racism?
9131,How does one differentiate between local contract for foreigners and expat (package) contract?
9132,How does poaching maid work?
9133,"How does that justify racism, classism, or downtrodding the underprivileged?"
9134,How does the government treat expats better?
9135,I agree with u/Stezo187 they need to be banned from having domestic workers or have their NRIC on an 'known abusers' list.
9136,How exactly would the welfare of migrant workers impair progress
9137,Xenophobia and racism are 2 very different things.
9138,Issues of racism are also discussed.
9139,"It's not like they're actually calling people racists, so one wonders why some people are automatically so defensive."
9140,Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane.
9141,"They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers."
9142,"If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore."
9143,Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.
9144,You are being straight up ignorant if you believe that we are bringing foreign workers here to suffer and die.
9145,"How is ""price discrimination on the sole basis of race"" not racism?"
9146,How is asking if you’re from China racist lol.
9147,How is employing a maid a form of slavery?
9148,"And if you say childcares, ain’t that also a form of service that you’re paying a maid for, except she also does housework?"
9149,"Hire a maid, duh."
9150,"How is it fighting racism with racism, exactly?"
9151,How is it racist in any way?
9152,You're the racist for assuming that nationality = race.
9153,It doesn't mean migrant workers also don't have issues to address as they clearly do.
9154,"Frankly this sub is so full of toxic nationalist racists, it's quite concerning."
9155,How is it xenophobic to ask PR to stay within the country?
9156,Only when society accepts that construction is a skilled job like other countries can it be possible to reduce reliance on foreign workers.
9157,"Most people who hire FDWs may overtly sound like they expect a lot (partially to set higher standards in the beginning), but in reality most know you get what you pay for - which is basically someone to help around with the simpler stuff in the house."
9158,How is possible that for 1 year and half the maid never attempted to escape from home or call for help in any possible way?
9159,How is that not racism?
9160,Lol  Black people always make trouble has the same connotation as foreign workers always make trouble.
9161,It’s racism at its roots.
9162,A Singaporean receiving that 20 percent is simply the same package given to an expat.
9163,"If the salary package is fair, to ask for the 20 percent  just to be the same as an expat would inflat the package beyond the market rate."
9164,I've always wondered about expats relocating to another country e.g.
9165,They're not going to apologize for something they did not do which is being racist.
9166,Anyone with any form of critical thinking and common sense will side with the PA that calling this racism is a huge stretch that doesn't make any sense.
9167,"If someone call me a racist you bet I'll be defensive instead of ""let them say whatever they want and just apologize""."
9168,You could make a racist claim that those people might break your property or ruin your business by scaring away other customers.
9169,How is that not racist?
9170,Just because the threat of property is the fear that is coming from your racist thoughts?
9171,What should be controversial is how FDWs are borrowing money from licensed moneylenders and loansharks in Singapore.
9172,soldiers and domestic helpers are just different professions.
9173,of coz if you are talking about these maids and other maids who were treated better then of coz it's a different story.
9174,How is this racist?
9175,How is this racist?
9176,"Also, racist."
9177,"Regarding the pro/anti immigrant stance, I'm pretty sure there are redditors who have an opinion contrary to the majority of r/singapore."
9178,How long till he calls his video satire and is actually criticising and making fun of people who are xenophobic like in his video.
9179,"The bottom line question is if Singaporeans in general need to treat their domestic helpers better, I guess your answer is no?"
9180,How many Hong Kong expats are there to significantly influence housing demand?
9181,How many counsellors or mental healthy professionals are there in Singapore who are able to communicate with the foreign workers in their native languages or at least understand their culture and situation?
9182,Is Singapore considered home for the rest of our immigrant population?
9183,How many of your expat friends are supportive of the current border restrictions?
9184,"How many times do we need to see ""the actions of an isolated racist"" to acknowledge the fact that racism is absolutely foundational to Singaporean life, and has been for a very long time?"
9185,"How much are the media and Singaporeans looking into this aspect, the horrible financial abuse of migrant workers by Singaporeans and others already in Singapore, vs. ""nasty miscreant foreigners, why are we letting them in?"""
9186,"Before you complain about how difficult your life as a landlord is to justify your racism, ask yourself that."
9187,How much for 1kg of indonesian maid?
9188,How much money would it cost to build temporary accommodation that solved those cramped dormitory conditions to the point these reinfections wouldn’t be happening?
9189,What the govt is doing now is to step in and help ease the migrant worker conditions.
9190,Most impt is the migrant workers issue no?
9191,How much would you charge to be a domestic worker or a construction worker?
9192,How much would you charge to be a domestic worker or a construction worker?
9193,The data disseminated that distinguishes community spread vs dormitory spread is meant to prevent excessive fear mongering.
9194,I'm curious because I've read in a blog post (by an ethnic Chinese) that classism is more prevalent than racism in the UK.
9195,"Judging from the fact that you did not receive overt racism, it seems like people were discriminating you based on your perceived social status."
9196,This may not be racism technically.
9197,"How racist you have to be to purposely not sell the last piece to other than your race, so that you can finish off your work later?"
9198,How sure are you most of them there are maids?
9199,How the fuck did you go from  Speaking English -> Internalised racism -> Aspiring to be more western.
9200,Are westerners who try to pick up Mandarin because China is the new economic powerhouse also have Internalised racism and aspire to be Eastern?
9201,How they stoked racism and xenophobia.
9202,How to choose sides between two a-holes...  One side says they want to talk about immigration and jobs but singles out ceca and indian immigrants.
9203,The other side just made racist statements in the last election.
9204,"Because if it was for other reasons like say, [advocating for entire minorities to be interned and ""re-educated"" ala Xinjiang to get rid of terrorism](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o67agd/woman_who_shouted_racist_abuse_on_bus_jailed_for/h2r9hmt/), then I could see why."
9205,How likely is it that a VTL request gets declined?
9206,"Additionally: before the VTL was in place I remember that EP holders needed re-entry MOM approval, is this still the case or is the VTL approval enough?"
9207,How we treat foreign workers (maids included) is really disgraceful.
9208,How will letting migrant workers interact with the community lead to any of the things you suggested ?
9209,How would they even know if someone's a domestic helper or just an ethnically Filipino guest of a resident?
9210,"being an asshole) and you're attributing that to their race, then you may be racist."
9211,"IF take in high end one, then locals complaints all high pay job taken by foreign expats, making Sg PMET losing their jobs."
9212,"Or, I’d run into “colourful” characters like the manager I’d [previously commented on](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/946rn9/watch_absurdly_racist_prick_refusing_to_take_the/e3j40mu/?context=3):  > I got scheduled for an interview with one of those outfits several years ago, to lead a software-development team."
9213,"But when every single interview asks what languages besides English I speak (after establishing that both the customers’ communication and relevant docs are in English), I’d suggest that racism plus ageism has done a number on my career that would have been hard to match had I moved literally anywhere else on the planet."
9214,"Yet since they cater mostly to recent immigrants, many of them are nearly invisible on the English-speaking Internet: they’re rarely covered by local bloggers, mostly missing from the usual delivery services and often not even listed on Google Maps."
9215,female US expat.
9216,"However, the reality is that the average pay of a maid is $550 as a foreigner (with long working hours)."
9217,Singaporean cleaner working full time is paid 1.5k on average and with $900 saving is still more than the maid.
9218,Any quotas on Epass for expats?
9219,"Hu, UK citizen here traveling into Sing via VTL, applied amd accepted for the VTP."
9220,"As a kid I did make those jokes as well, but as I grew older I realised how harmful those remarks were and completely stopped making any casual racist jokes."
9221,I'm an employment lawyer (not humanitarian fyi) and Singapore is known for having the poorest and least enforced labour laws for foreign domestic workers in the world.
9222,"Just to name a few reasons: no maximum daily working hours (FDWs work an average of 16-18 hours a day), often asked to work at multiple households (this is technically illegal but I've seen it happen so many times), have little practical recourse if abused or harrassed, no guidelines around providing them with decent sleeping conditions and food... Again, just a few reasons."
9223,"This is a [good article](https://www.dw.com/en/singapore-domestic-workers-suffer-exploitation-and-abuse/a-48101632), but there are also other formal legal and think-tank (by our local unis) writeups if you're interested:  >According to a 2017 study conducted by the independent institute ""Research Across Borders,"" six out of 10 FDW in Singapore have experienced abuse."
9224,"I am sure many crazy bosses are capable of that, but the legal safeguards under Singapore's Employment Act (which doesn't cover maids) prevent that in the first place."
9225,"The maid who died at 24kg - she had visited a doctor, malnourished and covered in bruises, but the doctor ultimately deferred to her employer who refused to let her go for further tests."
9226,"It's hard to argue that's not a result of a general societal view of helpers as somewhat ""owned"" by employers, which is propagated by a lack of legal rights for maids."
9227,"For example, it's now illegal to confiscate a maid's passport, which used to be a common way of threatening/ controlling a maid's every movement (and also prevented many maids facing physical abuse from seeking embassy help)."
9228,In practice though many employers still take their maids' passports.
9229,A lot of snowflakey (yes I said it lol) white people in the States also complain about racism against white people in America (just like how Singaporean Chinese like feeling victimised) but err.
9230,"Realistically you can't really equate racism against white people, and racism against Asians in the US lah."
9231,Huh money is last on maid employer mind .
9232,Getting gamed by maid is.
9233,Huh what xenophobic?
9234,When it came to timetabling they just marked the period as mother tongue and everyone went their separate ways for classes.
9235,The tamil class in my school combined students from multiple classes to make up the numbers so they aligned the timetables to have mother tongue at the same time.
9236,And a huge number of the infected were limited to young fit migrant workers who got locked up in dawns and used as guinea pigs.
9237,And why deeply racist?
9238,"Huh, TIL Singapore is more xenophobic than I previously thought."
9239,"Thus, many students with learning disabilities are forced to take foundation mother tongue language."
9240,"Huh, no la there is no racism in Singapore."
9241,"Huh, so me and many other Singaporeans suddenly having to quarantine due to VTL tickets being suspended over Christmas and New Year was then a completely pointless exercise after all?"
9242,"Suddenly Singapore has a slightly smaller population, and we want to give maids citizenships?"
9243,"All these so called party leaders were sleeping when their representative commented bout losing a part of Singapore because there are too many  coloured people, calling CECA,  Chennai biz park or repeatedly targeting specific community?"
9244,Or even with his perceived free import with CECA how come SG able to maintain the racial balance?
9245,There is a not insignificant Burmese migrant worker and expat population in Singapore.
9246,A lot of FTs like myself here aren't on expat packages.
9247,"And work permit holders are tied to their employer, and are under contracts."
9248,"Around 15 years ago, in my school Malays always had the best results among the mother tongue(100% passing rate for O' level), we were always lamenting on how malay is so much easier than chinese or tamil."
9249,I'm just very upset that these kind of racism still exist today in Singapore maybe I was blinded by my circle of friends that consist of multiple races.
9250,That is certainly wrong and racist.
9251,"For most places, VTL or not, you can take ART before you depart."
9252,But people are wondering why is she not calling out UMNO for this racist policy against minorities.
9253,"If she is indignant about perceived racism by the property agent in SG, I would imagine she would be offended by the overt racism practised by UMNO back in MY."
9254,Singaporeans have been xenophobic since 1959?
9255,Why is being a maid degrading?
9256,And your comment stinks of xenophobia.
9257,"Huh?what do you mean by receiving end?My grandparents rarely curse mind you,which OP mention about grandparent being racist."
9258,Is it acceptable for the grandma to treat the maid this way?
9259,"Human beings are intrinsically racist, xenophobic, nationalist whatever you call it."
9260,Not saying racism is right.
9261,"Europe has to learn to get along with Muslim, and US is no stranger to deeply rooted racism."
9262,"So don’t be frustrated that racism is not eradicated overnight, it will have to take time."
9263,"Also, don’t judge others simply because they still hold on to some casual racism, especially the seniors, you don’t know what a long way they have come from their time."
9264,It would no longer be racism but personal observation.
9265,I stand by my belief that live-in maids should be illegal in Singapore.
9266,"Hwz has equal visibility for idiots, ignorants, racists, bbfa, hidden dragons and others."
9267,"But there is a cost to determined regulations and enforcement, and that cost is passed down to the consumers, be it in housing, or cleaning costs, or whatever services that migrant workers perform for us."
9268,"You don't have to look far to see this - when the migrant workers caught the Covid-19, the calls of 'deport them' and 'not our problem, why take care of them' and 'walau they get free <hotel stay, cash, SIM card, whatever> '."
9269,The opinion that minorities can't be racist isn't something most people hold.
9270,I'll see Chinese peeps at work/school everywhere basically so I will definitely feel the effects of racism whereas if it were the other way round (it's still awful but) it wouldn't affect them in the same way.
9271,There was also this racist teacher of my cca(NCC).
9272,"We tried getting a maid that speaks Tamil, so maybe they'd have an easier time."
9273,"I absolutely abhor anti-PRC 'racism' (if you can call it that) in singapore, and I judge every single person by their individual character."
9274,"Of course as a white guy, I dont experience racism anywhere near as much as others might."
9275,"Australia has always had a racist element, but my view is that its only been in the last decade or so that it has become something that Australians have seen it as (somewhat) OK to express it."
9276,Australia is becoming more racist as we excuse or look the other way when others are racist.
9277,TLDR: There are racists in every country - those who look the other way or dont condemn racism makes a **society** racist.
9278,I was impacted by CECA too although it took me a long time to realise what was happening.
9279,"But I'm minded to call it what it is, racism."
9280,I think it’s terrible that so many households are reliant on the help of live-in domestic helpers 24/7 and as a result many of them are awfully overworked.
9281,"I acknowledge I’m pretty racist and I didn’t post any BLM posts, I’m doing my part!"
9282,The underlying issue of racism against our foreign migrant community needs to be tackled head-on.
9283,"I actually agree with your point, especially because the most destructive forms of racism are often unintentional."
9284,Many modern efforts to combat racism are self-defeating because they try to pretend that everyone is the same and there’s absolutely no difference between the races.
9285,"When you want to avoid being racist, you do that by treating the other person as an equal."
9286,Don’t go out and make friends from other races for the sake of having friends of multiple races or not looking racist.
9287,"That’s reducing people to categories and being very, very racist."
9288,6 months onboard with no wifi and just doing manual labour non-stop only to return to the accommodation and endure more racism.
9289,"They came into an election amidst a bunch of screw ups and controversies (#notmypresident, POFMA, dormitory workers outbreak) and to add had a tricky leadership change with uncharismatic Heng ""East Coast Plan"" Swee Keat at the helm."
9290,"I think that if people are set out to express racist and xenophobic views, they don’t really need any information to “back up” their view."
9291,"Equally, however, you make a very relevant point in that if you share enough information, it will be enough to pre-empt and forestall the *spread* of such racist and xenophobic views."
9292,It’s a question of recognising that racists and xenophobes who will hold to those views come what may aren’t likely to change their minds no matter what kind of information is shared with them.
9293,It is racist (or racially insensitive - you can choose your terms as a matter of degree) to assume that one entire ethnic group only eats one type of food.
9294,"In the same article I linked above, there is a section that highlights how Canadians racially discriminate against new immigrants."
9295,"""A sizeable portion of Canadians are using race as something that would alter their view of whether or not there's too few or too many immigrants coming to the country.”  This article ([https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-race-and-immigration-are-a-gathering-storm-in-canadian-politics/](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-race-and-immigration-are-a-gathering-storm-in-canadian-politics/)) also quotes similar data:  >But from a low of 30 per cent in 2005, the EKOS poll respondents who say there are “too many visible minorities” among immigrants has climbed back up to.... 39.9 per cent in the latest EKOS poll."
9296,This additional article here may also further illuminate the racial underpinnings of current Canadian immigration law:  [https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/analysis/racism-lurks-in-canadas-immigration-policies-561500852.html](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/analysis/racism-lurks-in-canadas-immigration-policies-561500852.html)  It's such a pity that the country you wish for Singapore to aspire to also faces similar issues regarding racism in immigration policy.
9297,"In the articles I've linked above, observers have warned that if immigration is not managed (quantitatively & qualitatively), backlash from the population will ensue & result in a setting back of immigration policy."
9298,"I agree  While the maid does seem rude, your comments are NOT good at all 'she has a roof over her head and food' .. 'she gets every Sunday off'.. that's by LAW right???"
9299,And just basic human decency.. it's just that the standards here are low in the way ppl treat their maid and you base it off that..
9300,I agree - I've seen and been engaged in those conversations by other expats (not all Brits - just generally).
9301,"It is indeed frustrating to see Instagrammers blindly hop onto this movement without even taking the time to educate themselves, and the thing is, criticism about this part of the movement is just drowned out because people can just label you a racist and carry on."
9302,> The maid said she was forbidden to go back to Indo and she also came clean quite quickly.
9303,It is racist.
9304,"During Covid, we see the same situation repeat this time primarily against Indians despite CECA being in place for literally 15+ years."
9305,"I feel the action, while wrong, is carried out based on societal expectations and normalization of such casual racism."
9306,"However, i feel that Esther is calling that action/question racist with how she worded her tweet (by literally saying 'thats racist' after her point)."
9307,"3 racist, what would be the alternative that that staffer could've said/done?"
9308,The staffer cant be sure whether or not an actor is racist and really should not be liable for safeguarding themselves from actors lashing out.
9309,I understand that one cant decide whether or not something is considered racist except the group thats involved.
9310,I agree racism can stem from ignorance but it's a world of difference between a display of ignorance vs a display of racism.
9311,"Right now, the fact that flagrant examples like this go unpunished merely serve to reinforce the idea and attitude that such racism is perfectly acceptable."
9312,But that doesn mean we can go around bashing them and making snide/sarcastic and xenophobic remarks.
9313,"I agree that FDWs are here to work, not on a chalet."
9314,"I agree that concepts like that can, and should, be applied to conversations about racism here, but it has to be placed in context."
9315,"Last year, there was people criticising the police here for being racist, which is kinda odd and irrelevant (also, out of touch) because the police here is not the police in the US and aren't racist."
9316,I agree that domestic helpers (or maids) should not be abused.
9317,"The way I see it, having a maid is a form of luxury, even if people could not pay them the best wages, they should treat them with respect."
9318,"Majority of the abuse seems to come from middle-income families that struggle to pay for their maids, yet, want to have maids."
9319,"My distant cousin is a good example, he has gone through 5 maids in a year, and from what I see, he isn't exactly a nice person (which is also why I've kept away from him)."
9320,People like him seem to treat their maids as tools to make themselves feel like kings by venting work frustrations on them.
9321,"I get that some who have special needs do require maids, but for the others who do not appreciate having one or cannot afford having one, please do not hire them."
9322,"Yes, minority voices are important but not when they are unreasonable and aggressive in crying that everything is racist."
9323,I agree that people who say such stuff do come across as xenophobic.
9324,"Like when we encounter a bunch of rude aunties one day and we go home and rant about how ""Singaporeans are rude and third world mentality""  IMO it's a pretty huge, condemning leap from the statement made to divining that his *intentions* ""behind posting such a statement cannot be anything else other than the poster being a xenophobic asshole taking advantage of the current crisis to unleash his very unpolitically correct point of view on a (relatively) safe platform""  It's also obviously not an attempt to make an argument that all 7 million of them are rude (him and his friends and family included?)."
9325,"I agree that racists believe one race is superior, but it's also racist to make assumptions based on a race, or exclude because of race."
9326,"I am talking about racism, not about religion."
9327,I agree that some people may have caused to become xenophobic...
9328,"Although some idiots are genuinely racist bigots, I don't think it is right to label anyone opposed to mass migration a xenophobe - many just want to preserve their culture, a desire that is quite fair in my opinion."
9329,"However, the new variant detected in India has severely exacerbated Anti-Indian/South-Asian racism in Singapore, something my sister has faced in school and I have faced as a NSF in camp."
9330,"But we also should'nt desansitize issues of race and religion(particularly minorities facing increasing racism), instead tackling these sensitive issues head on."
9331,"So much so that as others have pointed out, much like the prevalent casual racism in our society, it's considered a norm."
9332,All I am saying is that we should accept that there is a racism problem in the housing  market(regardless of nationality) and try to come with a solution to tackle this(I know it is easy to say) instead of brushing it off as something that cannot be avoided or it just a natural human instinct like how certain comments are in this post.
9333,"It's often out of sight, out of mind with these migrant workers so it's good to see discussion in Parliament about this matter."
9334,There was a discussion on one of the daily vaccination update threads a couple of weeks ago where a possible hypothesis for some data discrepancies was that folks who had already contracted Covid (primarily migrant workers) were being vaccinated at a higher rate.
9335,Image Singapore up there with Qatar in throwing migrant workers into camps and let disease run through it.
9336,To add to that.. the recent changes to S pass and work permit requirement is likely to hit many sectors paying below avg wages for foreign workers (raised to min 2.4k recently if i am not mistaken).
9337,"Yeah U can also state ur opinion but again if u have a different view on it(go against the trending opinion) u may get backlash(sad, this is another topic how we gonna solve(BLM/racism) it civilly)."
9338,I agree to a large extend but still do not see it as being racist in that situation.
9339,People in the staffer's shoes would have to deal with different actors and i believe a good portion of them will be racist and bias against indians/malay.
9340,Its more of a 'are you racist about it?'
9341,The one who is racist will be the actor who are against acting that scene with indian/malay.
9342,"Current day immigrants do the same, while local populations might consider if culturally they preferred the opportunity cost of better material prospects vs spiritual fulfillment (for lack of a better term)."
9343,"Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”  If your very first response to this post is to try and gatekeep racism or explain away how very tired you are of people talking about this very issue, then perhaps you are the “white moderate” that MLK is talking about."
9344,"Even now, I dnt think they have explained the CECA in a way that ppl will see the inherent benefit esp to those from 20-40th percentile of income earners."
9345,"Somehow, the CECA debate is a very convenient smoke screen for not only the nativist/racist arguementators but also the PAP, that is happy that the attention is diverted from other pertinent issues like unfair employment, cost of living, income inequality, etc."
9346,"Hence why, I'd rather the data needed to address the issues brought out by those bent on lynching CECA, be out quickly, so that we can move on to questions on housing, cost of living, employment practices and so on."
9347,Singapore is great for expats.
9348,"I agree with how you feel for the most part, but I don't get how not dating an Indian is racist."
9349,"My parents are racist at times, and they’ve left a bad taste in my mouth every time they’ve said outright degrading things behind closed doors."
9350,"Thankfully, most of my peers, no matter their race, have not shown racist tendencies."
9351,"However controversial this might be, I will say this - I do not condone outright racism and will call people out for it, BUT I have exchanged racist jokes with my Malay/Indian/foreign friends who are comfortable with it, usually when we are exchanging banter."
9352,This is in general the problem I see with maid abuse.
9353,Force people to stop shitting all over their maids and respect basic worker's rights.
9354,Sorry you’ve had a shitty time with the racism too.
9355,"And finally, it's not like we don't think xenophobia is going to be a problem for bettering Singapore, we already know that."
9356,I agree with the migrant workers part.
9357,"As you will read on this thread, many 'expats' here want what Singapore has to offer -- the low taxes, ability to travel around SEA while living in a high quality city, being in an English speaking environment, etc."
9358,"As non-white in one of the Western countries, I am also a target of a racist minority."
9359,I think it provides a learning lesson to folks that are racist to view things with a different perspective.
9360,"Although if they were racist, the points might just go pass their heads, as long as one person can address their prejudice, I think its still a win."
9361,I agree with the sentiment that people should take personal responsibility for their own racism and xenophobia.
9362,"However, ignoring or dismissing societal explanations for the level of racism and xenophobia in a society is counter-productive."
9363,"Things as personal as suicide and having children are subject to social pressures, so inherently social ideas of racism and xenophobia definitely will as well."
9364,"This cheapens the value of citizenship, and expats/PRs should control their 'outrage' when locals have been getting the short end of the stick on many issues for years."
9365,"There was every opportunity for them to refute the allegations of racism, but engage in constructive dialogue for purposes of learning and racial harmony."
9366,"I went for exchange in Washington state (northwest, not DC) for a year, and while it was never the worst there were instances of racism I faced."
9367,"They seem to be projecting these lockdowns and tracking devices and travel restrictions years into the future, although you have to read between the lines because they're totally non-transparent about how they are even thinking about their strategy long-term."
9368,It’s very unfortunate that when people try and point out racism they are derisively dismissed as being “woke”.
9369,"Surely it can’t take such an offensive and overt expression of racism on the part of the man against a mixed race couple, who were minding their own business, to spur us to condemn such racist speech and acts in Singapore."
9370,"Equally, however, it’s important to note that just because our situation may not be as bad as some parts of the US, it doesn’t mean that there is no racism in Singapore."
9371,"To move forward, we should acknowledge that some acts are racist regardless of whether the perpetrator is in the majority or minority."
9372,"This, of course, does not obviate the need to address the very real concerns that members of the minority ethnic groups unfairly face more incidents of racism compared to members of the majority."
9373,I agree with you 100% on the racialised language targeted at Indian expats.
9374,"It is undeniable that the ""CECA"" language is racially coded and liberally applied to any person who looks remotely Indian."
9375,"I would only ask that you can maybe not suggest that PRC immigrants are ""spies and traitors"" for the CCP."
9376,"And Shoppee was founded by PRC immigrants - there is nothing for PRCs to ""take over"" because they created it."
9377,"PRC immigrants and Indian expats face many of the same struggles - housing ads still often say ""no Indians and PRCs"" - so it's just a little disheartening to see some anti-PRC sentiment in what is otherwise a slam dunk of a comment thread."
9378,"At the end of the day, companies here don't value their staff, and foreign workers works best for them because they at some point will go home, the loyalty is to the money and they know that they like us are equally replaceable."
9379,How does posting on social media improve the problem of racism?
9380,"All it does is spread awareness, but do you really think your friends on social media don't know that racism is an issue in Singapore?"
9381,"If you really want to solve racism, go do something about it."
9382,"I agree with you but after working in supermarkets where maids would always do the shopping for their employer, I was surprised to see maids and employers talking to each other like friends and talking with respect for EACH other."
9383,"Also fyi, employers have to go through courses on how to take care of their maids."
9384,"I made friends with plent of my friends' maids, they are very open and genuine when you show that you are not a snobby high ego trash."
9385,They were fucking racist towards Indians.
9386,I also agree that there's this unfortunate tendency to label someone as racist and leave it at that.
9387,"I think this results in unnecessary polarisation and doesn't explore the bases of their beliefs and prejudices - hence not actually reducing racism, but driving it underground."
9388,I agree with you that I don’t think the PA is being racist.
9389,"Edit: Don't say foreign workers or in construction, companies in general don't even pay locals well or enough to retain them, they'd rather let you leave or resign and hire a new guy."
9390,"Something along the lines of ""hey, posting about blm is great and all but perhaps you may also want to drive local conversations around racism because we face such issues here too""."
9391,"Now is really the best time to raise awareness about discrimination, since recently we also have the migrant workers dormitories case."
9392,"Lots of sacrifices to be made (family bonds mostly),  so I won't think that expats going back are ""soft""  just because they didn't feel like they belong here."
9393,">Recruiters love to tell me they want an expat because Singaporeans are ""entitled"" and ""not driven""."
9394,"Hate, bigotry, racism, anger, anti-government fanaticism."
9395,"I agree with you, but I think the focus on Bello's case is due to his actions having high potential to further aggravate xenophobia amongst locals who are already displaying it."
9396,"As a Filipino, I understand that these are just a few amongst the many Singaporeans who are not racist or xenophobic -- I have many friends who are locals and we have spoken about the xenophobes."
9397,"I don’t know what others think, but I personally welcome the tone that Min Lawrence Wong took in this speech on racism (see [here](https://youtu.be/j0D0ayvUl64))."
9398,"When I asked about problematic maids, poof all the down votes incoming!"
9399,It’s a way to integrate with the locals instead of being sequestered away in an expat enclave.
9400,"IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers?"
9401,There is a difference between foreign talents and foreign workers.
9402,"Ie domestic workers, cleaners etc."
9403,But the video uploaded by Prettipls has crossed the line and I think it was racist.
9404,And just because the video was done by a minority race against the majority doesn’t make it any less racist.
9405,People would have called it out as racist and so would I.
9406,There shouldn’t be a double standard in labeling something as racist.
9407,"If a Chinese doing it would be racist, the same should apply to the minority race."
9408,"There is no reason why you need that many expats from the US to run P&G Singapore / Asia Pac, it is not rocket science."
9409,"However, in the case that the migrant worker decides that he perfers to rest on wooden mats rather than on mattresses, they have the choice to sleep in such conditions as well."
9410,"Next, cleanliness is the responsibility of the migrant workers."
9411,Don't just think of pushing the blame to the government without thinking of how the migrant workers will actually be affected if certain regulations or policies are put into place.
9412,"The first thing that jumped out is how the LHZB's article attributed three factors to ""the *rise* in racist incidents""."
9413,"KH's tl;dr shortens it to ""racist incidents"" (leaving out the ""rise"", which drastically changes the meaning)."
9414,"Kirsten's comments were also questionable:-  > 3/ According to @zaobaosg's logic, racism is the fault of everything but racist systems/structures, and long-held prejudices."
9415,Not correct - ZB is talking about what makes racist incidents *increase*.
9416,"> 4/ It doesn't talk about the harm caused to minorities who have been subjected to racism, but borrows a US right-wing bogeyman to suggest that Chinese people are being unfairly demonised via imported ideas of Critical Race Theory."
9417,"I agree, but I also think maids should be paid more though I don't intend to get a live-in maid."
9418,"I don't really judge others for having maids because I know those families need the help usually, but I would personally feel uncomfortable with having one."
9419,"I agree, if one chooses to have a maid, I think ya gotta treat her like a sister or a friend who is like being second mom."
9420,"They will love parents, grandparents, their maids and aunts too."
9421,"I agree, mother tongue should be worth 2% of the grade at most."
9422,They so badly want to frame Trump as an evil Islamophobic racist that they call his ban an anti-Muslim ban when his executive order was targeted towards dealing with the threat of terrorism.
9423,"I agree-- its ridiculous that both parents have to work-- most likely in an office somewhere, and then use that salary to pay a maid to raise the kid."
9424,"I’ve met many incompetent foreign workers, supervisors, drafters and even engineers who cannot fulfil their roles and responsibilities."
9425,TWO nurses kena and he got 5 weeks along with two other racist incidents?
9426,But should the government pay for all upgrading to the dormitory.
9427,"When there is a shortage in a particular role employers who have roles to fill respond by making jobs more desirable  with benefits like more vacation time or added additional paid health care  Canada accepts skilled immigrants to file these roles as well, but foreign workers are offered the same legal protection as citizens and the right to apply for residency and citizenship in due time."
9428,This in turn gives them the power to vote for laws that protect foreign workers and prevents exploitation.
9429,He could be genuinely racist or really he could just have been a disgruntled grumpy old Hokkien boomer uncle.
9430,I am disappointed that they did not recognise dormitory conditions to be a perfect ticking bomb for a cluster forming.
9431,I also acknowledge that some dormitory operators have been too mercenary at the expense of basic hygiene provisions.
9432,"But that said, I acknowledge that migrant workers are here for a reason that is mutually beneficial - we gain from cheap manual labour that no Singaporeans wants to do, they gain from higher pay than what they would ever get back home."
9433,I mean the fact that foreign workers come to singapore already means its a better paying job than whatever they can find in their own countries.
9434,"If you tell someone they're a racist, materialistic cunt, they go, well its the PAP that made me this way with their ""policies""."
9435,I used to hear horror stories about how racist others can be towards you when you aren't the majority race.
9436,Be it for politics or racism.
9437,I notice people here tend to be quite racist and they just don’t understand it because they’ve not received racism themselves before.
9438,"But the really painful kind of racism is when you are not being treated in a hostile manner, but treated as a burden."
9439,This is the kind of racism that’ll eat away your soul over time and not everyone realizes it’s happening to them either.
9440,"That’s not to say that we don’t have outright hostile racism here either, we don’t think we are racist because we don’t discriminate as much against our four races, but look at how we treat Bangladeshis, Filipinos, and Chinese nationals here."
9441,Why learn about racism from “black” people.
9442,"Go ask Malay friends, heck, I’m sure all of us know at least one racist relative."
9443,There are many DINKs who do hire domestic workers too.
9444,"Posts that just suggest the reported cases of non foreign workers are on the decline or stagnant, reflecting that the measures from 'CB' are already working are delusional."
9445,And if there's anything else an immigrant should know about.
9446,&#x200B;  >Do you have the slightest sense that calling someone a racist is a very serious allegation here  Very much so.
9447,There are consequences in most part of the civilised world for being racist.
9448,Your problem is that you hold on to an antiquated understanding of racism seemingly only backed by the way the law deals with it.
9449,"We can denounce racism in its most detestable form, and we can denounce racism in these forms that were committed without intention."
9450,"If you restrict immigrants, they pay more for low quality workers."
9451,Test less non-VTLs and test longer VTLs.
9452,"If he is an Ivy league grad, and the field is developing and has potential to grow, he may be considered a ""foreign talent""."
9453,The op somehow made a connection that needing to submit a photo for visa application makes a country racist.
9454,- people who think that banning all Chinese nationals from entering Singapore for a brief period of time is akin to some xenophobic crime.
9455,I also heard many migrant workers who lived in dorms earlier are forming groups and renting HDBs.
9456,"Since such people are already shallow, i dont think they will complain abt having another ""moniker"" of being a racist as well."
9457,"And yes, preferring to date a certain race is racist, just own it."
9458,Not racist at all
9459,The worst are those who use the word xenophobic at every opportunity even when our own people are being abused and mistreated.
9460,I don’t know if you follow the Parti Filipino maid case.
9461,But it doesn’t mean the people are xenophobic.
9462,"I always called my family's FDW ""auntie"""
9463,The true racists (and there seem to be more of them every day) either pretend I never said anything or become even moire hostile.
9464,"Modern Singapore is, without question and with only one serious competitor, the most self-glorifyingly racist place I have ever lived in, the Singapore National Pledge be damned."
9465,I’ve seen situations where companies have already identified their “foreign talent” and claimed that no Singaporean can do the job.
9466,"I always find it interesting how certain generalizations are decried as racism, whereas other generalizations are held up as truth."
9467,I always get that “Oh you don’t look Indian” coz I have light skin and a lean face .. but I have never faced any racism here for the last 6 years I am here.. except from a local chinese guy who tried to insult me and I put him in his place then and there
9468,"Some xenophobia is good, I will not trust a nation-state whose inhabitants are not a little bit xenophobic, because that means they don't give a shit about the country and have no cultural identity."
9469,"Lastly, the PAP is to be blamed for xenophobia in Singapore."
9470,and clarify when they ask that it’s my domestic helper.
9471,I always wondered how parents explain to their kids the role of the FDW in the house.
9472,What do they then make of the FDW who play this subservient role?
9473,I always wondered why digital nomads and expats still choose Dubai over Singapore.
9474,"People like to equate racism to people being assholes about it but always brush away issues like this as ""casual racism""."
9475,"This is not right, I hope that one day people will realise the so-called ""casual racism"" are actually something that slaps on minority's face every single day."
9476,"I am Chinese, but I personally witnessed a lot of racism done to minority groups, so much that I cannot imagine what it must be like for an Indian or a Malay on a daily basis."
9477,"I know such incidents happen, racism does exist, but I didn't know it is that bad."
9478,"> She is obviously going to respond like a 9 year old, which includes calling you racist, and throwing food at you."
9479,"Back on topic, they don't have this law/regulation prior to 2013, which mean no acknowledgement about Myanmar maids in oversea and no responsibility/involvement to whatever cases happened to them in oversea countries."
9480,I just want some discussion about racism.
9481,This is only what I have experienced and could be different for other people but I think its quite inconsiderate to sit at a table with your colleagues for lunch only for them to speak in their mother tongue to each other and leave you clueless as to whats going on.
9482,"just to give you a few examples, he blames and curses the indian migrant workers for increasing the number of covid cases in singapore."
9483,This domestic helper has been with us since I was in Primary 3.
9484,What would you do if your domestic helper is rude to you?
9485,"I've faced overt racism, irritating and demoralising micro-aggression and everything in between."
9486,"When I was in primary school (btw an ""atas"" primary school at that, with most kids being driven to school and maids waiting outside the gate when school ends to carry the kids' backpacks home), there was an incident where we actually came to a standstill and we had to attend anti-racism assemblies led by the principal because the Indian girls were being bullied severely."
9487,"No time for racism, it was a perfect bubble of acceptance and pure fun."
9488,The racism I faced was unique and laughable in equal measure.
9489,I cannot change the world and I don't want to waste my time convincing people who actively engage in racism and classism to....er stop all that.
9490,"I focus on people doing good, like those contributing to the welfare of migrant workers and volunteering their time."
9491,It is so draining and doesn't affect the racist one bit.
9492,"From the things I have experienced before and the migrant workers, it seems like Singaporeans are xenophobic by nature."
9493,"Lady was a Chinese and the interview went totally fine until she went - ""don't worry, we are not racist"" to my Malay friend."
9494,That was my first encounter with racism.
9495,"Overall it feels like Singapore just clams to be multicultural but as a minority I feel that I’m a token for the nation to be used to say that Singapore is multicultural and it gets worse when you tell this issue to your Chinese friends who will say “ where got racism in Singapore, I got Malay friend and Indian friend”."
9496,Having a friend of a different race does not mean that they do not face racism.
9497,I am not saying that all the Chinese are racist and know when they are joking around but there comes a point of time where you feel that you had enough and need it to be addressed.
9498,"I am a Singaporean gay man living in Singapore and have started dating a guy who isn't Singaporean, but who is here on an employment pass."
9499,We are flying VTL flight.
9500,All of the hypotheticals about the loyalty of Malays and Islam apply just as easily to the Chinese racists.
9501,I would go so far as to say that racism to minorities is a negative predictor that a Singaporean of Chinese descent will be loyal to Singapore.
9502,"Ironically,defending/excusing racism towards Malays and Indians in our government creates breathing room for these people who will sell us out."
9503,"It is not uncommon to see FTs (green cards, immigrants, the likes of me) amounting to a good ratio (~40%) of the new staff."
9504,What are your thoughts on the likely future tightening of foreign talent policies and how would it affect you/your business/talent acquitision?
9505,"PRCs tend to be more racist, elitist, and tiger moms."
9506,"I now believe in the need to try and educate others, also to speak up when someone says something ignorant or racist."
9507,I am a malay and i don’t think this is racist.
9508,I never use the word maid.
9509,They say I do not know how to ‘manage maids’.
9510,I am a singaporean and am not xenophobic like many do.
9511,"So regardless of my actions,  jaywalking,  or wanting to fight him, it's a pretty serious act of racism if you ask me."
9512,"Then, I have also met a whole bunch of ""practical racists"" who claim they won't rent out houses to Indians for so and so reason, won't go out with Indians for so and so reason etc.."
9513,"I do have local friends and certainly, not all locals are racist, but I'd put them at a really significant number."
9514,Maybe 30-50% at varying levels of racism.
9515,"In response, I usually either taunt others for their personal characteristics, or occasionally resort to racism myself, merely for the purpose of shutting them up."
9516,"I am not a racist, but I am not really militant about anti-racism either."
9517,"I am not against it in cases like this, whereby the person being cancelled ironically has her only talent as cancelling others and is now praying the victim card after being a xenophobic and racist fuck all these years."
9518,"I am against racism and xenophobia, but this argument painting *The White Man* as the cause of all of it is stupid."
9519,I am also quite sure you know more about expats than anyone else then with your line of reasoning.
9520,Indians may face racism outside of India but within India they can be racist to each other.
9521,I am an expat and have lived in Thailand and now Singapore.
9522,"No maid, not even for a sprucing."
9523,I am an expat and just got my own bicycle here (used and a bit rusty).
9524,I am an expat here for half a year doing an internship and I want to watch the wc final with a few friends also here for work.
9525,I feel that the racism here can be felt just tha it is not explicit like other countries.
9526,Norwegians are the most racist people on earth if you ask me.
9527,I am ashamed as a Singaporean to see how we treat our migrant workers.
9528,I notice that foreign talents/workers from other countries like India and Bangladesh do make an effort to speak to you in english.
9529,I am assuming there are some kind of visa restrictions that bind domestic helpers to a specific employer then?
9530,"That being said, always is the female employer torturing the maids wonder why.. fairer sex can be most cruel"
9531,"If not, why are there surprises (from time to time) with brain drain, discontentment over job security and complaints over foreign talent in jobs Singaporeans want?"
9532,I am confused but how did kristen arrive at the conclusion that racism is the cause of everything?
9533,"Feels to me she literally took 族群 as RACES, but it should meant ethnic groups where ethnic groups refers to many things, e.g chinese/malay/indians/europeans/LGBT/vegan group/SJW group/Conservatives/Democrats/Republicans and etc  In her twitter posts, she mentioned the author failing to mentioning on how certain groups are being treated unfairly or facing prejudice and she makes a conclusion that LHZB is spreading some fake anti-racists conclusion to the chinese educated folks?"
9534,There was a recent post on a Chinese man shouting racist slurs toward a group Indian boys for playing cricket in the void deck (I agree that the boys are at fault for playing there but that does not allow for the boys to get insulted on radical terms.)
9535,Does it mean we can stereotype all Chinese men to be racist?
9536,"I am currently an expat in another Asian city and find that it helps to have friends who understand the expat experience (getting used to new country, being away from family)."
9537,"I am currently reading up on Chinese philosophy, in particular from Mozi 墨子，just to rebut ppl who think 'racism is bad' is a western concept."
9538,"And again, not too expat heavy."
9539,I am disgusted to see people actually posting their stupid racist comments.
9540,"And no, I cannot use KL or Hong Kong, because I am discussing the foreign worker population creating competition and both of those have tiny foreign populations (5% and 13%) compared to Singapore and New York's 40%."
9541,"I am flying Singapore Airlines, pretty sure it is a VTL flight."
9542,They might be preaching to combat racism but am blind to the casual racism found in their home country.
9543,"Don't get me wrong, it is heartwarming to see our own Singaporeans help people abroad and fight for a good cause, I too would love to see justice for George Floyd and racism gone."
9544,"However, and I beg, don't overlook our own instances of racism here."
9545,"But now, with all the travel restrictions, SG seem to be farther than other countries."
9546,I am glad people see that that $1000 donation to the migrant workers fund is a ridiculous punishment to Jolovan Wham when he has already been working the ground for this many years and I am glad that people are warming up to the fact that people are standing up to the government so that people like Jolovan does not get suppressed and bullied around.
9547,I am both happy and disturbed that there are those who seek to defend PSP and/or continue to lambast CECA for what it is not.
9548,You instead tout him as an example about how CECA BAD.
9549,I am glad we have nice human being here who just don't force their maid.
9550,"My family treat the maid(be it anyone maid) as their own,so sometimes we do jokes around with them that we are nice people."
9551,"My family hired the 1st maid,came here to work,but didn't possess any skills.she is   good person but i guess she wasn't trained much that she didn't know how to thaw a fish & chicken,but it understandable that she could be from a countryside(kampong)."
9552,2nd maid was hired when i was in P5 & my 2 younger brother needed taken care of.she is a religious maid.someone who follow the islamic way.she eventually left on her 3rd year due to her family situation.
9553,"3rd maid,i have the most fond memories.when in sec 1,used to argue with her a lot over small misunderstanding.she is in her late 30s.can do everything.she left after contract end."
9554,"After that,my mom said no more maid,not because it was expensive,but she guess her children including me,are very lazy & not independent."
9555,But i believe we too has to choose the right maid.
9556,"Maid should have freedom,but we just wish the maid don't do anything weird outside."
9557,This isn’t like some sinkie racist today bullshit and I’m speaking about individuals who are celebrating the death and destruction in India and letting their inner racist flag fly.
9558,What needs to happen then because these are racists?!
9559,"Edit: for all you woke folks calling it racism, it’ll actually be racist when the country starts asking for certain races to be rounded up and deported because of the nationality or skin color."
9560,"I've inquired into the local HR department on trends in the market, and the expat packages are actually [on the way out](http://www.businessinsider.sg/expat-packages-a-thing-of-the-past/) [in the industry."
9561,"](http://news.efinancialcareers.com/sg-en/178307/expats-in-singapore-no-longer-on-expat-packages/) Also, as I am aware of our budget realities, I can absolutely tell you that, at least in my firm, the only people who receive allowances are now 15 years experience and up aka very senior individuals."
9562,1) Under your conception of racism (intentional acts only) we are nevertheless able to discern which instances of racism are worse than others.
9563,"The term ""racism"" thus encompasses a wide range of conduct, from jokes about Indians to the Holocaust."
9564,2) It is entirely unclear from your post why you think our ability to differentiate from (1) above would become non-functional if the term racism encompasses unintentional acts.
9565,3) The taxonomy of racism and crime is entirely arbitrary.
9566,"4) My point is that intention is not a requirement for racism, not that ""racism is separate from intent""."
9567,"Intention, if anything, would be an aggravating factor in how we assess specific incidents of racism."
9568,"""fluctuation"" or ""dilution"" of the meaning of racism seems to be putting the cart before the horse."
9569,We are precisely discussing what is the scope of racism.
9570,"So the notion that having a general meaning for ""racism"" comes at the cost of ""specific words"", is a false dichotomy."
9571,"At least we are acknowledging that subtle and not-so-subtle racism permeates society in Singapore and we can start to take steps to fix this for the next generation, and for those who have been the victim of racism in Singapore (I would guess any member of a minority race who has spent any significant time here) to start to heal from some of the traumas that racism causes."
9572,"Sorry to digress, I agree with you with your take on LKY's memoirs and also welcome the tone that Min Lawrence Wong took in his speech on racism."
9573,"But many Singaporeans I know treat me like an expat who has only been around for a couple of years because of my still American accent - only to realize that I know more than they do about the history, the roads of Singapore, the movements of favorite hawkers, and places and things that do not exist anymore."
9574,"I got nothing from it other than “I’m more woke than you, allow me to tell you about every single insight I have into the plight of maids”."
9575,It seems to me like he (and you according to this thread) are taking a moral high ground and vilifying the act of employing a maid.
9576,"However op here dismissed other people's views as xenophobic, choosing to take the moral high ground without any substantial reason to do so"
9577,We would be looking for a nice one bed apartment ideally close enough to Bendeemer road where other expats live.
9578,"For work permit holders, or fwd, or foreign workers, I don't think it is a must."
9579,"All the above are just my thoughts, and I am excluding investment immigrants."
9580,"I am not comparing with illegals in particular, I'm comparing with migrant workers in general."
9581,I come from a rather poor country and didn't have the luxury to keep live at home maids to do our chores and take care of the elderly.
9582,It is not unreasonable that a FDW requires some privacy especially after work hours where they can talk to their family members without their employers listening to her conversations.
9583,What I want to say is that a demand for privacy should not be seen as the FDWs have become very choosy employees.
9584,I am not justifying or supporting the racist remarks.
9585,"If we do not recognize the root of this racism issue, we cannot hope to solve it."
9586,Systemic racism needs to be fought from the ground up as well as from the top down and I hope we can all make Singapore a better place for our fellow countrymen.
9587,I am not saying the expats are right.
9588,"I am not sure about the Malays and not many of them have maids in the first place, but you gotta be kidding about the Indians."
9589,Sri Lankan maids have suffered.
9590,I am not sure if I am right but it seems that the size of a army bunk is much larger than the size of a room housing the same number of foreign workers.
9591,I am not sure if PM Lee indeed said that private firms are dominated by foreign talents especially in the general sense.
9592,"I think it is always possible for students to take mother tongue language in another school, but this is tedious."
9593,Usually students entering SAP JCs (not sure if this is a thing) require higher mother tongue exemption and there should not be a problem not taking MTL.
9594,I am finding it hard to draw a line to determine whether this is racist or name-calling based on one's unique feature.
9595,Perhaps anything assorted with colour is racist?
9596,You already have more rights and privileges than the FDW you’ve hired!
9597,"Its target market is expats in Jakarta, many of whom don't read Indonesian."
9598,They play to this expat crowd..
9599,"I am pretty sure the employer will try to wipe their hand clean from all responsibility by giving some bull shit reason that the death was caused by the maid, not the one giving the instructions in the first place to perform a task which was inherently dangerous to begin with."
9600,Village of the immigrants perhaps?
9601,"The renting market seems very racist.. For example, I've seen a lot of ads asking specifically for Chinese females for example.. do they want people who come from china, or is ""Chinese"" just a way of saying Asians only?"
9602,Are Singaporeans more racist than I am used to as a European?
9603,"I am really taken aback by your experiences, the casual racism in the daily interactions, and even gauging the worthiness of the relationship based on skin colours."
9604,"(Actually, my country has shameful problems with mass incarceration, racism, police brutality, and poverty, just to name a few)  However, I just wanted to say that it absolutely breaks my heart in the most painful way to imagine the above happening to a nine year old boy."
9605,But I can tell you I worked with expats in Singapore who thinks that Singaporeans are peasants and that feeling sucks.
9606,"Again you can follow my other responses to see how having a personal choice formed through multitude of factors doesn’t necessary equate to racism, sexism or ageism."
9607,"Ill fight for BLM yes, but ill try to solve those who have been mistreated in SG just like the Blacks in US, to show that im not for racism at all, in US or in SG."
9608,"I am saying, to be sure we got an epidemic of racism problems, you need to get accurate data."
9609,Never seen such racism before.
9610,I am so sorry you have experienced so much racism in your life!
9611,"For context, I am a sociology and psychology student in my final year at university and many of my friends/classmates are super intolerant of racist and discriminatory remakes."
9612,"We understand that as Chinese, we are privileged and will never ever understand the extent of racism that minority groups in SG faces."
9613,"My parents, for example, are super racist."
9614,"I also would never disrespect Singaporeans by saying something as degrading as ""Singapore needs foreign talent like us...""."
9615,"I am sorry mate, but apart from the foreign workers in the dorms, and of course the maids, the foreigners do not live in sublet flat/condo rooms and they do not send most of the money back home."
9616,"I can assure you a vast majority of Indians are humble and sweet just like a vast majority of Singaporeans are nice, hardworking, and not racist."
9617,"As a Chinese, I unfortunately have to agree that there's a lot of racism directed towards Indians and Malays by my fellow Chinese  In the end we are one Singapore."
9618,I never hear my teachers say racist shit.
9619,"Otherwise I could reply that beat up your in-house maid is not unlawful, because there are people doing it."
9620,I am stating the presence of VTL is a nontangible enhancement of working benefit and most incoming foreign workforce from within Asia undercuts local salary.
9621,Allowing VTL for them would have a bigger impact than say Bali
9622,I am sure expats would be willing to do so.
9623,Local- born Singaporeans should not be given a choice as they are provided with a lot of subsidies and liberties by the Govt as opposed to an expat.
9624,"If local Singaporeans don't wanna do NS, then they should renounce the citizenship and take up citizenship elsewhere and then come work as expats in SG."
9625,"I am sure not all expats feel this way, it depends on their domestic options and if their company has a domestic branch to support them."
9626,"If that were the criteria, Jollibee is a racist company??"
9627,"I am talking about those people who made racist comments and hence I wrote ""rephrase""."
9628,I am thankful you feel the same pain as our migrant worker group does.
9629,"To us, better to quickly travel now before the VTLs get discontinued"
9630,I am used to hearing about racism coming from uneducated people but WTF is wrong with her teacher?
9631,"The maid often threaten to use the cane when we were being naughty, but she never really used it, even though my mom encouraged her to."
9632,I am willing to give this person the benefit of doubt because she is a known community activist for foreign workers and thus she would be in a position to know more due to her active engagement with them.
9633,I do not want to sound racist but since they are PRC I am not sure how open they will be if I went up to talk to them also certain terms/words that they use I am not so good at understanding.
9634,He is correct to question why taxpayers should foot the bill to clear up a mess the dormitory operators have profited from.
9635,The dormitory operators are not innovative start-ups coming up with market-disrupting products that will shape the future.
9636,I personally really like the variety of Indian food that the new NRI immigrants have brought to Singapore.
9637,It's still shocking (but perhaps not surprising) that there are people in this thread condoning this type of racist behaviour as some kind of sacrosanct privilege of owning property.
9638,Anyone who's too racist to be a landlord can always sell their condo and buy some shares in a REIT or the Straits Times Index.
9639,"Even as we speak, muslim immigrants are pushing for Sharia Law in Australia so I can see why a person who is not familiar with Singapore culture like Col can have a cause for concern."
9640,There are many foreign workers suffering in such conditions.
9641,"I appreciate your perspective - but we’ve normalized and justified the exploitation of domestic helpers just because it’s a easy, cheap and accessible solution that solves our difficult problems."
9642,Much like the issue of migrant workers and dependence on cheap labor.
9643,"It doesn’t help that a majority of Singaporeans  essentially think of domestic workers as lesser humans from the third world, and their freedoms should be curtailed just because they provide their 500 a month and a roof over their heads  I don’t profess to have a complete solution, but as a start, I’m definitely for raising average pay, giving them more rights under the EA, and repealing the restrictions imposed into their freedom."
9644,But I get that it’s an issue that will forever be overlooked by the government for political reasons - Singaporeans will jump to defend their employment of domestic helpers at the first chance.
9645,"I ask this question because yesterday there was a extreme positive article about Shopee founders who are mainland China immigrants (now Singapore citizens):  How Singapore Nurtured Foreign Trio Who Became Billionaires  This appeared in Bloomberg, SCMP, Yahoo news outlets."
9646,Is there resentment against mainland Chinese immigrants in Singapore?
9647,I asked in the sub about why does MOM tolerate 2/3 and 3/4 PMET coming from the same nationality  in my not so eloquent way   I got responses ranging from beating maid and drunk driving ????
9648,I asked this in an old CECA thread and never got a clear answer:  How do Singaporeans take advantage of reverse CECA and get visas and investment preferences in India?
9649,The maid's will be borne by home or probono?
9650,"I assume that you didn't, because if you did, you'd realise that financial firms there are chock full of PRCs and other Asian expats."
9651,The idea that there's some global conspiracy by Western companies to exclude third-world citizens from expat packages is fantastical.
9652,"I grew up speaking English at home, Hainanese(Wenchang dialect) to my Grandmother so ENGLISH is my mother tongue."
9653,"The Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) classification, in place since the first Census in 1824, has been put to use in housing and education policies and it's an outdated way of classifying people."
9654,They have a large expat community as well until recently.
9655,1) Making an economic decision about who to rent your room with is not mutually exclusive with being racist/xenophobic about it.
9656,So you can definitely choose to “incur less costs” and yet be racist or xenophobic at the same time.
9657,I attended a couple of safety courses with migrant workers.
9658,"I beg to differ, don’t think it’s a case of racism, but a case of having personal preference, it’s just like a person having preference to eating eating their favourite food or having the preference to date and marry a certain race."
9659,"In fact, i’d say that my time in SAP schools had sheltered me from passive racism that commonly occurs in mainstream schools."
9660,"I think kids pick up subtle racism from peers, so it’s more racist in mainstream schools where there are obvious targets for racism."
9661,"In a way, quite sadly, in an environment where there is no target for racism, kids can learn the right values, and grow into respectful individuals who can interact and build meaningful relationships with different walks of life."
9662,My domestic helpers now come clean if they fuck anything up because they know lying and me finding out later is going to be much much worse.
9663,"Also, that's an extremely racist pre-conception you have about the idea of saving face being uniquely Asian and thus a uniquely Asian problem."
9664,I think it's useful in terms of discussing institutionalized racism as opposed to just attitudinal racism.
9665,"He was also clearly able to understand that the guy was accusing him of being a racist (he said in Chinese, maybe to the local Chinese passenger, that all races are the same)."
9666,"Stopping maids from taking an off day for example,  a full 24 hours off day, is not right and is not fair"
9667,"Given the nature of Singapore being a globalized city state that is dependent as much on immigrants as native born Singaporean, how do we define ‘being Singaporean’?"
9668,"I believe it wasn't the author's /publisher's intentions to be racist per se, but this actually reflects some sort of racist bias that a lot of us have deep in our minds that brings about ""dark skin being bad people"" stereotype, just that they are not aware of it."
9669,"Some may argue that it wasn't intentional and therefore should not be considered racist, but thats what we need to work on as a society- which is to be mindful of such minor discrimination that we may have at the back of our minds."
9670,"Just for example, the exorbitant costs that are paid by expats in International schools are in turn used to fund subsidised education in SG."
9671,I definitely want to see International schools folding up if expats are leaving and then observe the knock-on effect of it.
9672,"I believe that the government rationale for VTL is to limit the total number of international arrivals to Singapore, though I think they're being way too conservative at this point."
9673,All the more so since Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines have lost their crown due to the travel restrictions.
9674,"Or your parents can go to Germany first for 2 weeks then fly to Singapore under VTL (presuming they are vaccinated) and avoid quarantine altogether (they still need to apply for a pass to enter Singapore, but from Germany they should be fine)."
9675,I believe the CCP is trying to make the world think that the USA is a lot more racist than it actually is
9676,"I believe the idea is she is free to criticize Singapore if she is critical of racism in Malaysia, which is much more rampant and shows in major policies."
9677,"This would show that she truly cares about racism, not only when it doesn't benefit her."
9678,"Indian immigrants with their caste bullshit and their saltiness that Tamil is the Indian representative language and Chinese immigrants speaking to everyone in Mandarin and putting no effort in learning English because to them, this is a 'Chinese' country."
9679,I would welcome an immigrant who came in last week and is willing to assimilate with open arms than an immigrant who has been here for 5 yrs and doesn't associate with Singaporeans.
9680,That the Government will gladly hang its own people in a heartbeat but expats (e.g.
9681,They've managed to balance dormitory standards and operating costs that are borne by employers.
9682,"If you're that ambitious, I suggest you raise a Kickstarter or funds to provide for the better dormitory conditions."
9683,My personal view is that we cannot deny the existence of racism.
9684,"In your example, you are essentially discriminating against having a muslim roommate (for the reasons you've stated which i personally consider practical) but you're not a racist (not to me at least)."
9685,I bet this guy doesn't hire ~~maid~~ helper.
9686,"But after reading about that maid in the water tank, I only drank boiled water."
9687,"I booked a flight to Singapore today, for later in the year, and you posting this comment, made me wonder if my flight was VTL or not."
9688,"I bought a non-VTL flight by mistake, and gambled on the idea that VTL concept would be scrapped by May so I didnt cancel it."
9689,I bought my maid some sourdough breads because she love it but my friend questioned me why would I buy such expensive bread for her.
9690,"But I think it's fair to say they didn't ""ace it"" last year, if you're a migrant worker cooped up for the whole time and treated like a guinea pig."
9691,I brought up the issue of racism (in the context of my personal experiences) and some old man told me I'm beating a dead horse and to stop.
9692,"I buy nasi padang, the macik sell me more ex I also never cry racist or price discrimination."
9693,"I call my domestic worker ""maid"" because the term ""maid"" is not derogatory term but is, actually, her occupation name."
9694,"I call them ""helpers"" instead of ""maids"" because we have a lot of pinoy people around, both in blue and white collar jobs and I dont want to offend them accidentally"
9695,I call this the maid test:  want to see if the person is a piece of crap?
9696,Check out how he/she treats the maid  Want to take the test further?
9697,Connive with the maid to make a minor error in following instructions and see how your friend will react.
9698,At least we get to eliminate the opportunity for racism to happen through these kinds of cut-offs filtering.
9699,Edit: Took non-VTL flight
9700,"I can assure you that in the US the idea of having a a live in maid is very foreign and simply ""weird"" to most."
9701,Aussie got it good when it comes to migration and expat life
9702,"I don’t believe that people are born racist, just the environment that they were brought up in, and I don’t think China as a country have been very kind to people with dark skin tones."
9703,This kind of xenophobic sentiment occurs in all countries to some degree.
9704,However targeting ALL companies and foreigners with a collective crime regardless of the specific innocence or guilt of the constituent elements of that group – there is absolutely nothing that is more racist than that.
9705,"Because out of the $1500, $300 is to the government as levy, so you can’t give it to the FDW."
9706,"They are aware of their minorities, they are aware that there may racism, and at least there can be a conversation about it so something can be done about it."
9707,Lock up the maid?
9708,"I recall an incident where my classmate in Poly was complaining about how the Nasi Padang Makcik was being racist for charging her more (well, yes it’s racist.)"
9709,I don't think Singaporeans are xenophobic.
9710,The older generation is quick to assume that younger Singaporeans can't measure up to 'foreign talent'.
9711,"What goes unnoticed are the cases where locals, despite having both drive and the intellect, are being passed up for foreign talent because of (1) perception that ivy leagues are better (many who attend Ivy Leagues are foreigners in the first place), and (2) diversity quotas."
9712,I applaud the Singapore government in being proactive and forcing employers to allow domestic helpers a day off.
9713,"I can say for sure that as a kid, I’ve been bad toward my maid once ( got punished by my parents later )  i said something along the line of “you are only a maid”  ehhh... i blame tv   all those chinese medieval shows  my parents never talked rudely to my maids and i don’t have internet then soooo yeah, it’s the tv."
9714,The other thing to consider is which immigrant demographic you're looking at...
9715,"If I'm not wrong one of the functions of our immigration policy is importing cheap low-skilled labour by the boatload, so I can't see how an English requirement would work?"
9716,I can see both sides and I wouldn't call either xenophobic.
9717,I can see lots people here never have a maid gone missing on you.
9718,But I can imagine that it'd be tough if you absolutely can't speak your mother tongue.
9719,"I can take a racist joke and hand them out too so I think I'll fit in haha, thanks for the heads up!"
9720,"But the ministry is always 5 years behind the times...  SG pays top dollar for foreign talent, but then burdens them with rediculous paperwork."
9721,Also who said anything about eliminating all foreign workers?
9722,I can tell you that some former migrants are all for the language test.
9723,Really getting tired of everything being tagged as racism - are we USA now?
9724,"Can't even examine unfair hiring practices, that's racism yo."
9725,"Can't restrict, racism yo."
9726,"Can't balance out across foreign countries instead of a few countries only, that's racism yo."
9727,"Blatant racism, they simply don't like non-Chinese people."
9728,Although I guess points 2 and 3 are also forms of racism.
9729,"I can understand anti-cartel actions, but if the increases were also being passed onto the maids who dont really make much to begin with, and are often forced to work over & above what meager money they earn to begin with; it should be thought through in a more lenient manner"
9730,FDW are living human and I am sure they have their needs.
9731,"I can understand if y’all Singaporeans are uncomfortable with this, but isn’t attracting foreign talent a significant factor that contributed to the city’s success in the 1st place?"
9732,Should I stop donating to Comm chest because some members of the majority are racist?
9733,CECA has not contributed to this unhappiness and fighting it would in no way improve the situation.
9734,"I can understand where you're coming from, but in my personal opinion, it comes from an extremely privileged expat POV looking into Singaporean society and attempting to diagnose what she perceived as ills in society with her western yardstick."
9735,"(It's not, stomp has always been a thing)  She also used the plight of the foreign workers (a very real problem) as an accessory to explain how her ""civil liberties"" was curtailed."
9736,"Yes, the problem of the foreign workers is real, but using it to complain as to why you need to wear a mask is disgusting."
9737,"Every Singaporean knows about the expat/local divide and that expats live in their own bubble, and this article exposes what's in their bubble."
9738,"For example, the dormitory problem was cast as such because of the fact that she cannot leave the house without a mask."
9739,"I can't be certain, but fairly sure mother tongue is not counted towards your university admission into the three local publicly funded universities."
9740,I can't believe someone compared NS to the plight of the workers/maids here.
9741,I can't brain why no PCR is required for land VTL.
9742,I can't get over how some employers here mistreat their FDWs.
9743,I can't help but wonder how many Singaporeans are aware of they're defending xenophobia through thinly veiled comments.
9744,I feel like a lot of people are citing better screening as this one-size-fits-all solution to rude immigrants and it feels like a very naive worldview to me.
9745,"I guess part of it is also that most expats do intend to leave after a few years, so practically it makes little sense to invest in those relationships for locals"
9746,"So I agree with OP that salary is not the only issue due to how companies are structured in SG, nothing about cheap foreign workers."
9747,"And consider this, if Singapore introduce a new policy and set a floor salary of $4,000/month for every Singaporean today and bar all foreign workers, market dynamics would just catch up, and your $4,000 will now be $2,000 in yesterday's value."
9748,I cannot understand how you think a landlord is allowed to make offhand racist comments in his own house but a landlord is not allowed to decide who his tenants are based on race?
9749,"I cant seem to find any google sites which explains the immigration policy, can someone help to explain thanks :)"
9750,Don't fall to xenophobia rhetoric like the rest.
9751,"The racial issue is systemic with our deep seated whether perceived or not insecurity of meritocracy with foreign talent and our government’s refusal to address the issue openly, whether formally or informally."
9752,"I have no issues with foreign workers... but yeah, this sub does, and it's not even the most xenophobic one!"
9753,"So yes, by all means, we should be importing as many foreign workers as possible."
9754,"I completely disagree that whether racism is intentional or casual, it hurts people."
9755,Stop the whole talk about racism and just live your lives.
9756,It is just layers deep racism and it is very tiring.
9757,I conceded that xenophobia does not have to have to necessarily be cultural.
9758,"But, I think people are using xenophobia and racism interchangeably, and that's what bugs me."
9759,I concur with you that the mocking of the religious practices of the Indian guy in this case can be seen as an act of racism.
9760,"In which case her actions can be seen more as a childish and petty tit-for-tat retaliation, rather than an action that underpins any long-held malicious racist intent to deliberately belittle a particular religion."
9761,"Is she 110% a racist, it is difficult to say."
9762,"I am making this point because the net has been on hardcore SJW mode for a while now, and if everyone goes charging in shouting that everything is racist, or homophobic, or misogynistic; conversation and discourse ends there and then."
9763,"Some people who seem racist do what they do only because they might not understand other races/cultures/religion, and helping to change their point of view makes the world better a bit at a time?"
9764,What's wrong with stating her mum is an immigrant?
9765,"I consider cantonese and english my mother tongue, not mandarin."
9766,I consider the ad to be tasteless but not racist.
9767,I consider the expat excuse implausible since the agent was happy to engage with someone named Anja Chong in the first place.
9768,"I continue to be an ally to my LGBT friends in my social circle, who thankfully are also allies against racism within the Gay Community."
9769,"But when the Pink/Pride campaign in Singapore tries to avoid any open conversation about the existing racism within the Gay Community, does not provide sufficient visibility and platform for the marginalised within the community, than I have to question my own level of support."
9770,"Even as the young nation – facing the double-whammy of limited natural resources and a fertility rate that has fallen below replacement level – struggles to forge for itself a national identity, fingers are pointed adamantly at the influx of “foreign talent”."
9771,Nobody wants a racist / xenophobe in their company.
9772,"I cringe a little inside when I hear ""maid"" and I tried to treat my helper really well back when I hired her, so maybe there is something to that."
9773,A cursory look through the FDW Employers @ Singapore group on Facebook would reveal that lots of shitty employers refer to them as helpers.
9774,But I feel like anyone who refers to them as maids immediately gets my hackles raised.
9775,"I cringe a little whenever I hear people call them 'helpers' actually, as if saying 'maid' means you're someone who treats maids badly."
9776,"Just be a normal human being and treat everyone with respect, be it maids, bus drivers, or cleaners."
9777,"My mom, a mainland Chinese that's super pro-ccp, is extremely racist towards Malays and Indians."
9778,"I don't pretend to understand, hence aiming the post at fellow expats etc."
9779,"More for youngsters who want to travel, learn a new language while earning some pocket money rather than ""career maids"" imho."
9780,The next result was on the famous quote by joteo  “one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology”.
9781,The responsibility is on the the employer to take good care of both the maid and their parent.
9782,The grandmother treating the maid as a literal slave could be something equally obvious to her.
9783,"I did not imply that, in fact, Bloomberg, expats, PAP govt - none of them are championing Singaporeans' interests."
9784,"I merely remarked that if there is a healthy and human relationship between employer and maid, then the maid would probably dare to ask for help."
9785,"In contrast, the reality is that most maids in Singapore don't even dare to ask their employers for help."
9786,"---  Also, I hope you can see that the employer-maid relationship isn't like most other employer-employee relationships."
9787,"The maid eats, sleeps, and lives with the employer and has little contact with the outside world (except for her weekly rest day, if she even gets that)."
9788,I did not say that was not racist my friend.
9789,"I said it is racist, but more privileged side."
9790,Of course Singapore or any country has racism.
9791,To American I am too Asian/British To Asian I am too American/British  People like that are racist of course.
9792,"Yes, they are free to choose, but it is also a racist choice to make."
9793,I did try to google and browse through ICA websites but it is just SWAMPED with Covid-related travel restrictions and whatnot right now.
9794,"If there are people in the Chinese community being racist to their peers (and I am sure there are), throw the book at them."
9795,If there are racist practices call them out.
9796,"Show me where ""most minorities do NOT think it is an act of racism""."
9797,The men take jobs beneath women is about as true as foreign talent taking jobs Singaporeans think are beneath them.
9798,That makes me think that this VTL at least is more than a weak arrangement between the two countries (most of them are even less and are just one-sided into Singapore) but an agreement with terms which cannot be broken on a whim.
9799,I didn't know construction workers are considered expats here?
9800,I didn't know employer have to accompany maid for physical examination in the first place.
9801,I sort of remember my mom's maid always went alone.
9802,I didn't know it is my responsibility to make sure my domestic helper does her job properly even though I'm paying her to work.
9803,"I didn't know that calling chinese 'ching chong ling long' is racism, its my ignorance and incompetence, I'm not racist."
9804,"My guess is if you zoom out, every country in the world is seeing a net decrease in expats because people want to be close to their family during the COVID period."
9805,[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o1nrwg/ngee\_ann\_poly\_to\_fire\_lecturer\_who\_made\_racist/h21zhpf/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o1nrwg/ngee_ann_poly_to_fire_lecturer_who_made_racist/h21zhpf/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  &#x200B;  And 2ndly I'm probably one of the least supportive of Freedom of Speech of the American kind in r/sg.

9807,"I didn't say it wasn't a big deal, but I was just highlighting how he was racist."
9808,I didn't say it wasn't racist.
9809,Trust me - I know racism exists in Singapore - I was called blackie apunehneh very often in my neighbourhood primary school.
9810,And see - racism can be construed from the most innocent/naive of intentions.
9811,There's all these issues on population decline and the further need for more foreign talent to ensure Singapore's growth.
9812,I'm asking about how it's racist when it's just asking you to declare your race.
9813,Doing something wrong doesn't mean they are racist as well why equate everything to racism?
9814,So he's saying that sex between a FDW and her employer is non-consensual.
9815,"VTL = Citizen/PR only, LTP need to apply separately for a VTP amirite?"
9816,"Nonetheless, your question of whether sharing is sufficient to be accused of racism is an interesting and much more general one."
9817,"I didnt realize ""immigrant"" was a race now was it."
9818,I didnt slam cotton sheep minister for his uneloquent analogy cos the drunk driving and beating maids is not from him lmao.
9819,I didn’t know that’s possible because I remember there was an article that the govt was very strict about converting previous domestic workers to PR or citizens.
9820,"I didn’t say it made it better, nor did I say it wasnt racist."
9821,Most racism is irrational.
9822,I did not say there was rational racism.
9823,"I’m saying that it is racist, and having had a bad tenant of a certain race may be the cause of the racism."
9824,I didn’t say xenophobia.
9825,As for the racism against Chinese.
9826,"If, I am Indian man called you something racist, escoecially If you are a younger boy/ girl, it’s easy to either brush it off as literally a minority of Singapore don’t like Chinese people, or demonise Indians as a racist bunch."
9827,Let me be clear when I say the offence by the racist is equally bad to whomever they are trying to abuse.
9828,I differentiate between “racially or culturally insensitive” versus “racism”.
9829,You cannot be a “racist” without the intent to do so.
9830,But that in no way implies the offender is a racist unless he/she did the insensitive act with intent.
9831,Sorry but I do not believe in the liberal interpretation of racism.
9832,And we know that that is racism.
9833,"But when you take into account the numbers relative to their total, you understand how pervasive and systemic this problem of racism is."
9834,"Perhaps Singapore's version of racism is not institutionalised in state machinery like the US is, where systemic biases actively harm, but there is a lot of everyday casual racism that affects people in other ways, like rental discrimination or employee alienation for example."
9835,"I disagree with your first paragraph, even our PM LHL he himself said that the top positions in private firms are dominated by foreign talents, which meant NS does severely affect the productivity / quality of our nation's male labour force."
9836,Are foreign talents that much more attractive?
9837,"I feel it is more about the COVID19 situation revealing the racism that existed all along, hidden so well in better times."
9838,Agents can be racists too.
9839,"I would argue that the rest of SG internet is the real echo chamber, and this is one of the few places in which you can still have some reasoned debate about immigration and racism (like in this thread)."
9840,EDMW is really only a free for all forum if you're a Chinese Singaporean man who hates foreigners and Indian immigrants and like calling them CECAs.
9841,Try outing yourself as a white collar Indian immigrant on EDMW and pushing back on any issue.
9842,I dnt disagree that there are some ultra-racist folks among those that have skepticism about CECA.
9843,"Its funny that ppl like you underestimate Singaporeans so much, that you lump us with the far-rights and the racist."
9844,"I dislike it when my cousins addresses her helper as ""my maid"", makes my blood boil, and I make it obvious to address the helper by their name, and no need to address me as ""Sir"", I am not that much different from you."
9845,"Having said that, there is always good and bad domestic helpers."
9846,"So after that, this particular relative has had it with domestic helpers."
9847,"I dislike the term expat, always refer to myself as a foreigner."
9848,I distinctly remember Singaporeans were accused of being racist /xenophobic against China back then.
9849,This undertone of superiority is where I draw the line to judge if a joke is racist or not.
9850,Jokes don't necessarily have to hurt the listener to be deemed racist.
9851,I have been working at foreign worker recreation centres for the past 2-3- years.
9852,I do believe that xenophobia in Singapore is overblown by a loud vocal minority mostly commenting behind computer monitors.
9853,"If we turn the tables though, say a Korean, or Japanese or American company sets up here, would they experience the same racism as Chinese and Filipinos would face?"
9854,Would we so openly make racist remarks on Yahoo!
9855,"To me I feel its pointless to be racist, being the hub of Southeast Asia Singapore would get people from everywhere."
9856,Slowly but surely racism will die because it’s always stupid when you think about it.
9857,"I do get that, but dictionary meaning aside, I think we can agree the term expat, at least in Singapore's context, implies that somebody is talented, well-off, in high demand, etc."
9858,I do have to chuckle at the naive xenophobia displayed by some of the young people that post here.
9859,I do like to tell you a difference between foreign talents (FT) and Foreign laborers which is a difference in the jobs they do (high and low skilled).
9860,I do not agree SAP schools are growing elitism and racism.
9861,I do not see students in SAP school being academic better nor more racist than a non SAP one.
9862,But somehow these days all these are taken completely out of context and fabricated into nonsense narrative for whatever racism shit there is.
9863,"If there is a sudden spike in say chinese being really weak at their mother tongue, then on the next review it would be brought up to be discussed on how current budget and funding can be allocated to assist."
9864,"If a place prioritises the employment of locals, it would score lower in the ease of finding job from the expats' perspectives)."
9865,"In many cases, locals and expats might have conflicting interests."
9866,"What is bad for the expats might be good for the locals, vice versa."
9867,"For example, a country that does not subsidise the healthcare of expats would rank low in the healthcare aspect, but the locals might in fact enjoy good and affordable healthcare."
9868,My view is that the crux of the issue lies in achieving a good balance between the welfare of expats and the locals.
9869,"I'm simply speaking out against how deep rooted racism is in Singapore and I clearly repeated multiple times how most Chinese people aren't bad people, simply ignorant."
9870,"Pro tip, instead of trying to condescendingly teach me about my flaws (which I'm aware of) on a post that's CENTRED around racism towards Indians."
9871,I do think maids are advised to lodge a complaint with their embassy or one of the NGOs (like HOME) if this happens.
9872,Perhaps it will be good if MOM makes it a legal requirement for maids to be health checked every 6 months.
9873,"Both in today’s climate are deemed racists, but I would personally only condemn the second kind of joke, where there is a demonstrable disdain of a person’s worth or abilities solely due to race."
9874,"Also, I think people are quick to underestimate this but they forgot that this is not the first time PrimaDeli has been viraled for racism/alleged racism."
9875,I do wonder if the [new cluster popping up in a previously-cleared dormitory](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-sungei-tengah-lodge-new-cluster-clear-cases-13044566) has anything to do with workers not going for their mandatory testing...
9876,The CMIO system I agree is too rigid.
9877,"If you are talking about Thaman, I'd argue that racist point is a distraction to ensure that the 'Clique' keeps this amongst themselves and they know Thaman has too much character to play that way."
9878,"I don't agree since I was raised by a village girl, aka a maid."
9879,My cousin's maid who raise them are now taking care of their kids.
9880,"I don't agree with the government policy of leaving out children from VTL but what the actual fuck is this paragraph:  > She said because of the rules, she is now deciding whether to leave her daughter at home to travel with her 45-year-old husband on a VTL-designated flight, or to take a non-VTL flight for all three, which means a stay-home notice on their return."
9881,I don't agree with xiaxue's racist remarks and the reasons she used to justify them and believe that she deserves some bad karma for it.
9882,"If singapore goes to shit like America right now (white woman sporting braids getting branded as racist, and subsequently the cancel mob encourages the masses to boycott her business."
9883,"Now, it can be construed as racist (with an implication of culinary superiority, and therefore by extension ethnic/racial superiority), while I would lean towards this not being heavy handed in its prejudice."
9884,"However, I fail to see the relevance of your link, and how it supports [your comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g5t1yk/racism_in_singapore/fo5nmes/)."
9885,There definitely was (and still is) racism in Singapore.
9886,But the internet has made it much easier to both transmit and receive all sorts of ideas *including* racist ones.
9887,"Ultimately, the question is whether bringing in a certain additional foreign worker is going to benefit Singaporeans as a whole or not."
9888,"I don't blame locals, but this is the Faustian bargain of foreign workers."
9889,"If someone said that ""XX nationality comes to Singapore to molest people and f\*\*\* our maids"", it's racist."
9890,"Her first words on RK was ""Oops guess it wasn't a good idea to stir up racist sentiments was it?"
9891,I don't condone racism but I also respect an owners' rights.
9892,I don't consider PR as expats
9893,I don't consider myself overtly liberal or progressive and even I think that book is racist.
9894,"For the BLM movement, it's a movement specific to America but it also feeds into the global conversation about racism that has really ramped up over the past few years."
9895,Before you hire an FDW the employer must list duties that they have to undertake and put into an agreement.
9896,Our FDW requested to only wash 1 car so my mother offered to pay her $60/per car/per month to wash our other cars.
9897,If my little apartment is already not in the best shape then I must renovate my house just so that I can hire FDW that is also feasible.
9898,"I believe I agree with you on quite a few things, where we part ways is that I believe what you are asking for are already in place, there is already a Minimum Wage for these FDWs, if you are arguing for a Minimum wage increase, (i'll respond to your other comment in this comment) I believe you would need to be more specific because the value of what you are arguing for matters."
9899,"If you are arguing for a $100-$200 increase, I believe I'm with you but above that there is where I feel it becomes out of what is affordable that ultimately it hurts these FDW more."
9900,"Yes, xenophobia has a moving target but that doesn't mean that we should just brush it aside and go ""oh no"" and move on when those who are targeted try to bring it to our attention."
9901,"I also agree that the government is responsible for the foreign workers living in dorms contracting the virus due to inferior living conditions, there's no two ways about that."
9902,"That said, it is just how the situation with migrant workers has been handled by the government that, for the time being, effectively prevents them from mingling with the wider society outside of their dorms or isolation facilities."
9903,"During this time they're pretty much unable to mingle with the rest of us, which is very unfortunate, but doing so has clearly brought cases outside of the dormitory down to low double digit numbers."
9904,"Hence, I feel the virus is still very much under control, and it will probably remain so as more migrant workers continue to be tested."
9905,"One can only hope that this blows over quickly and they are allowed to return to the wider society soon, and that the government takes ownership of the dormitory problem and gets it resolved sooner."
9906,"Threatening to send maids back and void their employment pass is very common, some employers use it to scare their maids into not reporting abuse or starvation."
9907,"maybe minimum wage will help instead of cancelling CECA, and we should support that with WP."
9908,I don't feel that increasing xenophobia and racism is a permanent degradation of the 'Singapore character'.
9909,"Once the imbalances go away or become normalized, racism will cease to exist again."
9910,I guess my sexual preference is racist.
9911,I don't find people fearing East Asian looking ppl racist over covid19.
9912,"I'd say on a board that is hugely divisive where locals are often racist to foreigners and vice versa, this is really refreshing to read."
9913,"Even if the foreign workers clear the test, they are still very vulnerable to getting infected because of their cramp living conditions, no?"
9914,We treat our maids badly too - lest we forget all the abuse cases.
9915,I don't get why it is racist to say that someone's skin color is black.
9916,There is nothing racist at all.
9917,"The racist part only comes in when adults automatically associate ""black skin"" with being inferior."
9918,I don't get why people are racist towards people who leave China and come here.
9919,I don't get why you keep trying to equate racism and sexism.
9920,](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nx31qd/racial_preferences_cross_the_line_into_racism/h1du5q9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
9921,"Most of them have nothing to do with xenophobia, and the fact that you bring them up shows your ignorance."
9922,"Sure, you can question whether immigration policy is apt during this period, but when considering the sheer number of migrant workers and international travellers that Singapore sees, the effect to the economy is way more than just lack of tourist dollars."
9923,Disbelieving official information yet believing random Facebook posts or Tiktok videos makes one a conspiracist.
9924,One can be worried and concerned without resorting to racist or xenophobic overreaction.
9925,I don't have a maid and have two kids (1yo and 4yo).
9926,What's the fair price for engaging a maid?
9927,"Without even knowing how good a potential maid candidate can be, the only thing, sadly, is to lower the initial price."
9928,"Personally, if I ever hire a maid, and she is a really good one, I wouldn't mind paying higher to retain her services."
9929,I don't have a maid now but it used to be that you'd get fined 5k if your maid ran away or got pregnant.
9930,"If the government were leaving expats to die, that would be another story."
9931,"I am deeply aware of the problems that plague the US, from social issues like extremely inequality to institutionalised racism to companies and corporations having too much sway and control over the economy."
9932,"I don't have data on US VTL flights, but I do have data on UK VTL flights."
9933,We booked our flights to UK and back **before** the VTL was announced.
9934,"It took BA about a week to announce its VTL flights following the initial lane announcement by SG Gov, whereas SIA was more or less immediate."
9935,"Immediately when the VTL was announced, and before BA had announced anything itself, **all** of the discounted ticket types disappeared from availability on LHR -> SIN flights with BA for many months."
9936,"Our flight back to Singapore, which luckily was eventually designated a VTL flight, was as empty as the flight out to the UK (maybe 10-15% loaded), but it's impossible to know for sure all of the factors that determine uptake."
9937,"I don't have the stats, but as someone who is 2gen immigrant and knows quite a lot of immigrants through my parents, I assure you the ""stepping stone"" thing is not really true."
9938,Also I think if all the immigrants are leaving we wouldn't be having issues with housing and overcrowding?
9939,I don't hire maid.
9940,I am advocating an improvement for working condition for our foreign workers.
9941,I don't know about expats but my local friend got offered about 8-9k base for a marketing position with a large MNC.
9942,"I don't know her, but I'm thankful for the help she provided for migrant workers over the years."
9943,From my own experience this is to a great extent true of most white collared Indian expats (not foreign workers) working in tech and consulting.
9944,"Edit: I notice this comment is gaining traction, so I'd like to clarify that this is clearly a generalization and not all expats are like that, but it's just a large number observation at two MNCs I've been in."
9945,"I don't know if this counts as the worst racism, but definitely, the one thing that fucked up my whole day once was when I was coming through Changi Airport from Malaysia (i lived there at the time) to visit my very sick grandfather who was admitted to a hospital in Singapore."
9946,"They let the Bangladeshi women and family go first after like 30 minutes, but since I obviously was a young single male Bangla muslim dude, or whatever I was a threat or an illegal foreign worker."
9947,"In the time you've spent replying to this thread, you could have easily googled ""migrant workers in Singapore organisations""."
9948,"I don't know man, I would take 5 years of subtle racism I went through in Aussie over 5 years of getting smacked around physically."
9949,I don't know why people don't realise expats almost anywhere are overpaid.
9950,I don't know why you are in complete denial that maid abuse exist.
9951,Are you telling me a maid comes into Singapore and get  the luxury of a whole catalogue of bosses to choose from and they get to interview their bosses to choose their right fit?
9952,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/abuse-of-maids-on-the-rise-despite-stiff-penalties
9953,I don't know why you're trying to frame this as somehow bashing Singaporeans and thinking that the maid use rates here imply anything.
9954,"My initial comment was purely to state that the other reasons (wage and labour laws mainly, plus no historical precedent for having maids unless you're upper class) are the reason you don't see filipino maids being brought into Europe."
9955,As you point out expats move here and are happy to use maids - so whoever made the point that other countries avoid using maids through guilt is wide of the mark.
9956,Compared to foreign workers who got rice and curry and meats and 3 meals.
9957,The older generation been through hardship beyond these foreign workers.
9958,I don't have a domestic helper.
9959,"When people copy their definitions of racism in this thread (and the other ones), none of these definitions require intention, malice, or all the other ""requirements"" that people are bringing up in an attempt to say that this incident is not racist."
9960,"But ""domestic worker"" is a mouthful in conversation, so I use helper."
9961,I don't like how now everything is racist towards the majority.
9962,"Moreover, I feel that they may be quite racist towards Singaporean Indians as they give me that ""stink eye"" when I sit near them on a train or a bus."
9963,I don't necessarily disagree with that Ms Sarah Bagharib is asking for but I'm just clarifying the difference between insensitivity and outright racism.
9964,"I've heard all sorts of criticism about mainland Chinese from Chinese Singaporeans, and a lot of it quite xenophobic and unwarranted."
9965,"I don't really care about this lady's holiday, but this is a problem for expats that wanted to take their kids home to see grandparents for the first time in almost 2 years."
9966,Suddenly their flights are likely to change to VTL which means the children aren't able to travel.
9967,"I'm not even trying to say that Singapore is a racist place, and I definitely wouldn't say I'm a victim of racism or anything like that."
9968,"I don't really support a full on reopening right away, but whatever the general public can do, the migrant workers should also be able to do."
9969,"While it does use the word racism, I think that what the comic is getting at is more the concept of Whiteness, rather than ""let us be racist to people who are not white""."
9970,"I suppose a slightly more valid question to raise is just how much this issue of Whiteness informs the current response to the Wuhan flu, and whether we are acting as we do for valid, or xenophobic reasons."
9971,"The answer here I think is less clear - sure there are some valid reasons to be banning people from China and so on, but it is rather naive to not take a look at Facebook comments and see that indeed a lot of people are responding on a xenophobic grounds."
9972,I don't really think this is racist but I see a lot of people use rice and stir frying as a counterexample.
9973,Is this then xenophobia in your eyes?
9974,"Actual black people are relatively uncommon to see in Singapore for many of us, and given that all we are exposed to is their portrayal in Western Media (not always positive and tinged in stereotypes) and the ancient internalized racism common in our older generations, I think it is a VERY POSITIVE thing to start promoting more understanding of black people in Singapore."
9975,Racist should be made to feel uncomfortable about their racism.
9976,It seems like this has become less about the topic of racism and more about attacking this Esther Low and her character.
9977,I don't see any xenophobia/racism in that.
9978,"There are perfectly valid points that she made in regard to how for expats, friends fill the role that families usually play."
9979,Sad to see that people rather use this as an opportunity to espouse more hatred for expats.
9980,But personal and xenophobic?
9981,Xiaxue is defending her friend because her friend's domestic worker is behaving unreasonably and potentially illegally.
9982,Xiaxue is also promoting skills upgrading for domestic workers so that they can command higher salaries.
9983,"To say that Xiaxue cannot advocate for domestic workers' rights because she criticizes one badly-behaved domestic worker, is like saying you cannot support the BLM movement if you criticize some BLM protestors who looted shops."
9984,"I don't see how this is racist, isn't this just a parody of Marie kondo?"
9985,I don't see migrant workers queuing up for Koi.
9986,"In Singapore, inspite of all the ample and robust tools our government has to pursue racists we are now faced between Lee Kuan yew style autocratic conservatism and Lim Tean style populism."
9987,On the other hand we have a political opposition for whom nativism ( and the racism that hides behind it) is typically a foundational policy goal.
9988,The government seems reluctant to pursue racist rhetoric directed at non-Chinese even when the people saying it are in opposition.--let alone when the people saying are PAP supporters.
9989,I don't think answering that question counts as xenophobia
9990,I don't think anybody is arguing for a solipsist notion of the term racism.
9991,"When I say the term racism is socially and culturally determined, it means that there must be some form of agreement."
9992,"What's happening now is precisely this cultural determination in action: that there are people saying that racism means one thing, and others saying that it means another."
9993,Which is why you've chosen ridiculous examples such as arguing that theft is not racism (of course it isn't).
9994,There is no analogy to be found between the way the colour green is perceived to the way racism manifests.
9995,"&#x200B;  >If the term racism is define so broadly and up to everyone's opinions, why even bother with racial harmony?"
9996,"I don't think anyone here denies that the FDW situation creates a huge power imbalance, since most FDWs are impoverished foreigners who have little education or social connections in Singapore, and the domestic setting makes it difficult for outside agencies to enforce their rights."
9997,*  Are you seriously suggesting FDWs in Singapore are treated this way (aside from a few bad apples)?
9998,Anyway tons of maids just leave their jobs - MOM's website suggest that less than 50% of maids stay more than one year with their employers.
9999,In fact there is still a net increase in foreign workers right now.
10000,">A lot of my black classmates were shocked when they learned this, as it is incredibly openly racist by the Singaporean govt."
10001,The people who have friends and family who benefit from FDWs being exploitable are too numerous.
10002,I don't think calling out smelly chinese/malay/indian food is racist.
10003,I don't think that is racism though.
10004,I don't think he came through the normal employment pass.
10005,"But you say there's rampant racism because you see it, and he says there isn't because HE doesn't see it."
10006,Likewise your experience of seeing racism doesn't invalidate his experiences of racial harmony.
10007,"In fact, if you gross around for some of the best comedians in the world you will find many have content that are racist (but often self deprecating)."
10008,"Pro-immigration = free markets = right wing  From a social standpoint:  xenophobia = right wing, xenophilic = left wing."
10009,I don't think it's reasonable to label a country as racist based on events that happened 10 years ago.
10010,And using  USA as an example of a non racist country doesn't really help her case.
10011,If any teacher is reported for be racist today you can expect consequences for the teacher.
10012,It would hardly be unique to FDWs too.
10013,"It's probably not always the same the other way given how the seventh Malaysian PM's most fond memory of Singapore is being driven to the wrong entrance by a taxi driver, but I think the cultural ties far outweigh any geopolitical threat Malaysian immigrants may pose to us."
10014,I don't think laughing and moving on about being racist is helping the problem either.
10015,I don't think maids will stay as maids once they become Sinkies...
10016,"I don't think only the PAP and their supporters are racist, but because the PAP is the party in overwhelmingly entrenched power, it is the focus of my essay :)  I hope you believe me when I say I will condemn any racism from anyone, political party or leanings be damned."
10017,I don't think poster realise just how racist God is when someone must pay 1.5x more because of their skin color is.
10018,"I don't think singapore owes me anything, I was describing that the process is frustrating, and one of the major reasons expats move out the first chance they get a better offer."
10019,Overseas universities don't even give a sh*t about mother tongue.
10020,"I don't think that comment is glorifying anything- honestly, I doubt anyone who uses the term 'xenophobia' thinks of it as a positive thing."
10021,For example my uncle is taking care of my grandmother who has advanced Alzheimer's and there's realistically no way he can send the maid home at 6pm sharp while also chaperoning his three kids.
10022,"The problem here is just that MOM doesn't give our migrant workers an outlet to complain or seek legal counsel without fearing for their livelihoods, and in any case the base level of ""acceptable"" work conditions is so low that in many cases complain also no use, no law to enforce."
10023,Even the US does not discriminate between citizens and illegal immigrants when it comes to vaccination.
10024,I had uneducated people make racist remarks to me.
10025,"So yes it hurts to have an expat making 400K/year base leave, it hurts even more to have the expat take out their 2-3 kids from private school for 30-40K/year each, add on no more helper salary, no more landed house rental, no more insane bar bills, etc."
10026,It is also true that the average Singaporean is not as good as the average expat.
10027,The average expat is already someone who is educated/skilled enough to leave his own country and strike it out overseas.
10028,I think an analogous situation would be if comments across r/all on reddit are generally racist and xenophobic.
10029,I don't think the gong case is obviously racist.
10030,But let's not jump and shout racism too fast.
10031,I think that by shifting away from the use of foreign workers (that are often exploited) for low skill jobs will incentivise innovation and resuscitate our almost 0% productivity growth creating a more dynamic and lean economy in the long run.
10032,I don't think there is any controversy about whether racism is bad.
10033,"the controversy comes about when people say ""racism is the cause of XXX"" or ""XXX is racism""."
10034,"the singapore way of resolving the brownface ad was more of ""this is offending people therefore we should not do it"", rather than asking the question ""is this racist or why is this racist""."
10035,"I feel that in the latter scenario there will be people who claim that it is not racist or that it is acceptable or bring up counter examples of ""reverse racism"" which would stir up a lot more tension and controversy."
10036,"Germany is at 100+ per 100k, and we have VTL."
10037,"I don't think they would, the VTL flights in and out SG already sold up to the week of CNY."
10038,"If stop issuing the pass, effectively VTL also stopped for tickets bought for the near future."
10039,I don't think they're particularly trying to hide their racism behind dialect.
10040,"This bloggers know how to play to the crowd, and as you said, also seems to have supporters in high places.This plausibly draws her many pro-establishment followers in turn, but I really doubt any public figure would come out and endorse her history of racist and discriminatory views."
10041,"Germany chooses to treat its existing immigrants equally, but chooses to implement stricter immigration limits that are below SG levels."
10042,"For better or worse, SG has chosen to keep its doors relatively open (before the pandemic), at the cost of sharpening the distinctions between immigrants and citizens."
10043,I don't believe these countries have accepted immigrants at Singapore's rate (approximately 5% of the population every year for 2 decades) for this long.
10044,"From what I can gather (someone may correct me)  * [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Germany) has only experienced 1 year of this, during the peak year of 2015 * [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada) takes in approximately 1% of its population every year * Hong Kong (as you have pointed out) has a far smaller immigrant population  than we do."
10045,Would Germany/Canada continue to treat immigrants this favourably if they had to accept immigrants at such a high and sustained rate for 2 decades?
10046,"But I think the Singapore airshow has been full of industry leaders and experts from around the world looking at the VTL system and saying ""what?"
10047,"I can summarize racism/discrimination in Singapore (and Asia) with this one quote of a Singaporean ex-friend of mine: ""Don't go in business with that man."
10048,I don't think we are racist but we are increasingly xenophobic (which is a different story)  I do see the divide though and we tolerate differences but don't mingle outside our race very much.
10049,"I agree that other countries have more in your face issues with racism, fair enough."
10050,"In contrast, nobody in Singapore would ever hurl racist abuse at me but at the same time the vast majority of people seem to think it will never be my *home*, which kinda sucks."
10051,"*The word expatriate simply means ""one who lives or is settled outside their home country""."
10052,"*The word immigrant simply means ""a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country."
10053,I don't think you understand what racism means
10054,"Previous editions of pink dot was sponsored by MNCs with expat volunteers, and they were specifically asked to not do so."
10055,Do we need that many foreign workers in the first place?
10056,I don't understand how people that can afford to hire maid to be so cheapskate to only let the maid eat leftovers that the children can't finish.
10057,I don't understand how's that racist?
10058,"Ironically, the father who was heavy on corporal punishment with her, she left me with him since birth, as ya know, cannot afford maid yet, so leave with grandparents."
10059,That's why she BFF with maids.
10060,"I remember so many times,  the maid actually step infront of me to protect me."
10061,How is requiring that you are able to understand and use the language of administration here a xenophobic and segregationist one if it applies equally to all potential PRs/citizens?
10062,I don't understand why giving minorities more representation is considered racist?
10063,"You don't hate the reserved presidency for being racist, you hate it because of political reasons"
10064,I don't understand why it's racist to greet Ni hao to a chinese?
10065,I seriously cannot understand why ppl need to scream racist on everything these days!
10066,"The real racism here is the word ""sinkie"" obviously used as a derogatory slur to all Singaporeans but because we Singaporeans are so chill, we ignore it and tolerate it."
10067,Minorities supporting PAP are magically shielded from racism and hate?
10068,What has supporting which political party has got to do with being shielded from racism?
10069,I don't want to rent to you - okay  I don't want to rent to you because you're <insert race here> - racist.
10070,"It would be strange for Singaporeans to be this openly racist about the skin color of Africans when they same skin color wouldn't be problematic for ie., south indians."
10071,"Maybe I don't care too much only because I know xenophobia would always win out at the end of the day, and it's stupid to only focus on the rule breakers"
10072,I think racism can be combatted by proper education and by society itself dealing with that harmful behaviour.
10073,"It's run by volunteers, mostly Filipino maids."
10074,I dont allow my maid to use handphone because it is a major distraction.
10075,I think this new maid just want to use handphone on the sly thus the sim card.
10076,"On the other hand people that i interacted before that mostly have inferior complexity are Indians/Malays so before you downvote me for ""sensitive"" remarks, remember i interact with thousand of locals in my line of work and they're always the first one to bring up their race or call me racist even if they're the one being racist to themselves or if they're ""angmoh"" they would be treated differently."
10077,"I dont have a maid, and a new home owner."
10078,I dont know if it's the structural issue in our society to see workers as lesser beings (be it FDW or FW) or we see more cases due to media coverage.
10079,The maid lives under the same roof as you and prepares all your meals.
10080,"That aside, maids are human too and you giving them a salary does not make you anymore human than the maid is."
10081,"Look within yourself, I am an individual, I will stand up for the minorities, I will fight racism and I will do what it takes to make this a better country."
10082,"Instead we say, well its pretty much the government's fault we are racists."
10083,"Also, having lived in the UK and the US, from personal experience, I can say (at least in the big cities) racists and xenophobes are very quickly marginalised and even the racists know they are the fringe."
10084,"In Singapore it is in the mainstream, its more prevalent than people think, no other country have I seen racism/xenophobia lauded on forums about hardware to cars and bikes."
10085,There is a good bit of racism between the different races of Singaporeans.
10086,"I dont support force hiring, i want a reduction in foreign talent inflows,  so that our workers always have a slight advantage over corporations."
10087,I dont think calling you as ang moh is racist tho.
10088,Asking if you can take spicy doesnt seems to be racist too
10089,I dont think it's largely because immigrants are treating sg as a stepping stone.
10090,"I dont think its racism here, the reasoning might be that since more than 70% of Singaporeans are Chinese so it is likely they do not expect business during cny."
10091,"I dont think the NS argument is as strong as you think it is  A young healthy single 18 year old with no job experience who dont get to get out much, food provided at work, with additional risk/combat pay and probably still getting pocket money from family  Is very different from a domestic worker  if you remind those people of NS service, and equate workers with NSF, it may end up strengthening that thought in their mind"
10092,I dont think this is about race/xenophobia...its about accountability.
10093,Yeah singaporeans may be xenophobic that doesnt mean that we shouldnt punish foreigners who have broken social distancing laws.
10094,I dont think you get a say if your maid gets poached.
10095,Go watch that NTU Ted Talk about migrant workers in Singapore.
10096,"They have it pretty bad, but if you think migrant workers having it worse in the US will make you feel better, ill let you keep that thought 😘"
10097,"I don’t get it, what school holiday plans can they have made that are now in tatters, given that we weren’t aware of most of the VTLs until today?"
10098,Let’s hope this kind of racism will soon be gone!
10099,"With China muscling around the tech start ups , enormous money is diverted from China to India  my question is why will top tier come to a place with so much xenophobia and where they are reduced to an identity?"
10100,Am I taking crazy pill here because what you described is exactly racism?
10101,I don’t know - is saying I won’t date a white woman racist?
10102,"I was young, open minded, not racist at all, totally friendly to “foreign talent” and didn’t know how these things worked."
10103,Perhaps if we offered locals with the same skill set the perks that expats get?
10104,"But long-term, if we only hire highly-skilled, technical expats without training locals, then the expertise will always require bringing in foreign talent."
10105,"(This is almost the situation that the construction sector faces, too - Singaporeans don’t want to acquire lowly building skills, so we are very reliant on foreign workers.)"
10106,"I don’t know if I should call this racism but once when I took a seat in MRT, the guy next to me got up after a few seconds and changed seats."
10107,"I’m not Singaporean but I recognize that there are countries with lots of domestic helpers where this couple would get a slap on the wrist (light punishment, if at all), I’m glad Singapore is not one of them."
10108,He has ZERO chance of succeeding because Singapore has a structured way of “managing” foreign workers.
10109,"Now if u ask for my opinion, I will guess that the crowd of migrant workers won’t decrease regardless of how much you spend on them."
10110,"Also if you ask me, I won’t spend 1 billion on migrant workers, and would rather give every eligible voter $200."
10111,"But give us the chance to dream and fight towards a better reality for everyone, including our migrant workers."
10112,"Just because migrant workers or any workers are lowly paid and do work that others don’t want to do, doesn’t rob them off their rights as humans."
10113,"But, why can’t this Bangladeshi Baiya seek his own justice and not let this case become a precedent for further deterioration of migrant workers’ rights?"
10114,"I agree, that racism can be directed by people’s of all backgrounds to people not of their own backgrounds."
10115,I don’t see what’s so controversial about OP’s comments that merits you calling him a racist.
10116,"It may be unhelpful to call it racism bc that’s just gonna put ppl on the defensive, but I don’t think it’s inaccurate"
10117,What I see happing is expat families with one main earner and one trailing spouse realizing that EPs aren’t available for the trailing spouse and LOCs won’t be renewed.
10118,I didn’t say it was “racist”.
10119,Sarah didn’t characterise it as “racist” either.
10120,But not racist.
10121,PA was the one who mentioned “racist”.
10122,But do we have to or even want to wait until racist roots sink deep before we do anything?
10123,"You will be a laughing stock like myself when you carry these beliefs abroad...  Singapore is land of immigrants and the ""irritation"" is funny considering that a few generations back, locals here would have been ""irritated"" of our ancestor's behavior"
10124,"I don’t think either response is unfair - clearly the person is exhibiting casual racism by conflating all ethnic Chinese people as being from China, but at the same time there’s an excellent chance it’s due to a lack of awareness."
10125,"Unpopular opinion, but I honestly don’t think foreign workers would rank as even the top few issues for a lot of voters."
10126,I don’t think it’s helpful to describe people as either “racist” or “not racist”.
10127,"It is more helpful to identify racist behaviours, attitudes, assumptions, and so on."
10128,"Someone may only have one racist belief (that they are probably unaware of), but it is still worth addressing."
10129,"Plus, even assuming a person has no racist beliefs at all, they can still be part of the problem if they remain silent when action or speech is called for."
10130,I don’t think it’s xenophobic to ask people who have been to China recently to go in for a check.. or report for contact tracing.
10131,I don’t think it’s xenophobic for cab drivers to avoid picking up people whom he thinks recently came from China.
10132,I think it’s pretty xenophobic to want to send home all PRCs in Singapore though haha.
10133,I don’t think most of us are irrational and xenophobic.
10134,"We just don’t like to over generalise issues so much so that some companies are literally exploiting the policies as a form of cost cutting short cut, and over relying on cheap foreign workers (note, I didn’t use the word “talent” here)."
10135,Probably good not to conflate the notion of foreign talents (people we really need) vs foreign cheap labour (deeper issue of our labour cost vs coys over dependence)while we are at it.
10136,And frankly your neuroses re: utensils are not super applicable to everyone lol  By no means am I saying everyone who’s racially insulated becomes racist.
10137,"Honestly, even being raised in a racially integrated society is no guarantee that you won’t be racist."
10138,"The point, really, is that everyone can be racist/prejudiced, no matter their background."
10139,"And yeah, I’m sure plenty of PRCs/Taiwanese are racist."
10140,I don’t think the coconut oil incident is racist... the kids weren’t calling you ‘smelly’ because you were of a different race.
10141,"They said it was ‘smelly’ because it was a smell they didn’t like.. and perhaps it’s ignorance and not knowing that coconut oil in the hair is part of the Indian culture, but I really don’t think this one counts as racist."
10142,"That’s why I’m not gonna post anything, because I know I’ve made racist jokes in the past and still find some of them funny."
10143,"I’m not gonna pretend like I’m of a higher moral standard, and that those who don’t post are heartless racists."
10144,"There are a lot of overtly and subversively racist statements and actions that happen everyday, most people don’t notice it or care, because they are the majority."
10145,I don’t think your parents/relatives are “racist” since they are against more foreigners and probably not of any specific race.
10146,"I don’t think you’re racist, I would say non-racist."
10147,"But by doing better, by being anti-racist, by being more sensitive and opening your heart to more people you will be actually be the best of mankind!"
10148,"I don’t think, short of experiencing it first hand, that the idea of racism as a reality manifests for people like that."
10149,"A very small, often privileged, portion of Singaporean Chinese ever really experience systemic racism first hand."
10150,"The foreign worker has always been our cellar child, and I imagine this crisis will only exacerbate that."
10151,All you end up doing is causing a greater rift because you’ll have the foreigners/expats jumping in to say singapore is racist and you’ll have Singaporeans coming in to say why they’re not and why Indians are “bad”.
10152,She didn’t say anything degrading or racist.
10153,"Because of people like you, racism will continue to persist in the society."
10154,I doubt a foreign expat would tell everything about their intentions to a local I'm afraid.
10155,I doubt he'll ever understand why it's racist.
10156,Probably because more testing focused on dormitory and less on locals so not revealing the full situation.
10157,They’re risk appetite seems pretty big for imported cases considering they were ok establishing VTLs with UK and US which are two of the worst countries in the world for covid.
10158,A lot of them are racist as fuck.
10159,"I looked at the comments bashing people for xenophobic and racism , and recalled how I was in a tough situation back in 2009, graduated with 30k study loans, could not find a permanent job that paid at least $2k, while my family looked on , my mum gambled, and my dad mentally ill, no one was providing help to me while I was struggling with debts and mental issues."
10160,"I dun agree with the racist comments but I like to tell those who bashed the racists , you are also behaving in a certain self righteous manner, that is empowered by your relatively better position."
10161,"It is easy to criticise or bash others, for being xenophobic and racist when you do not have to struggle in life."
10162,"In all honestly, most people I know here in Singapore aren't racist."
10163,"I dunno, but I have a bad feeling that the silent majority is mostly racist/xenophobic as well, just a bit more polite about it."
10164,"I dunno, your ""power totem pole"" seems pretty racist to me"
10165,If you want an expat style lifestyle where you sip cocktails by your own pool it gets more expensive.
10166,These FDWs are protected.
10167,And rejecting racist clients requires a lot of moral strength as well.
10168,I employ a maid to look after my mum as I don't stay with her.
10169,Maybe the Chinese should exercise their privilege like the malays do in Malaysia to further validate the cries of privilege and racism.
10170,"She and I, went to the restaurant while the maid waited in the car with a open window...because she don't want to put parking coupon."
10171,I experienced 1998 racism back in indonesia.
10172,Nobody wins in racism.
10173,"The standard maid contract is 2 years and its a commitment, but soon after arrival she wants to leave for a family emergency."
10174,"I feel like being a maid/construction worker industry in Singapore is like slavery, but with extra steps."
10175,"Getting footnotes about how i should behave and change my apparently ""warped"" thinking From you, an expat, further drives my suspicions about ur actual intentions in this thread."
10176,I dont see how calling them trash because they abuse the system is racists or deserving of condemnation of you.
10177,I feel like its more cringe than racist.
10178,People who treat their helper/maid better or view their helper/maid as an actual person instead of a slave refer to them as “helper”.
10179,"However, I feel like there’s a stigma in Singapore, or at least in the more educated groups, to calling your helper/maid a maid."
10180,Poor maid 😔 i really hope this boy will learn his lesson.
10181,"I feel like racism will always been in a spectrum, with the highest being white supremacy, Aryan supremacy and all the racial targeting violence like the one in UK."
10182,"If foreign workers weren't so cheap (and exploited), maybe the industry would find ways to do the work more efficiently."
10183,"I feel like the boomer logic is pretty much just: ""I'm not racist cos the government says we're a multi-racial country!"""
10184,How could I possibly be racist if I went to school with Indians and had racial harmony day.
10185,I feel like the issue here is that you cannot call someone a racist just because they don’t want to rent a room to you without finding out the reason why.
10186,There could be a variety of reason but if let’s say the owner says “I don’t want to rent to Chinese because they always do prayers and burn incense and the smoke will darken the ceiling” then I feel that’s racist.
10187,I do have any scenario and wonder if that is then considered racist.
10188,Is that racist since it’s based on a preference?
10189,I feel like the main gist of this article is to encourage the migrant workers to be more aware of personal hygiene or the government to help them become more acquainted with the process of personal hygiene.
10190,The improvements in the conditions of migrant workers and the habits of their personal hygiene need each other for the cleanliness to be maintained.
10191,"Though I suppose there are some prejudices that the writer tends to have, such as the surface view that despite cleaners being hired, foreign workers don't clean up after themselves, and that they leave messes after parks (maybe some, but obviously not all), I think this was her main point."
10192,"I feel like theres too much racism against our indian friends, not only from the book but from the commentors in fb and edmw."
10193,I have seen a Previous boss hiring one maid to each of their kids.
10194,Also some foreigners have said they wanted to stay in Singapore because it is so cheap to hire foreign domestic workers to help them handle their kids.
10195,"I feel like trying to use this case as an indicator of the undercurrent of racism towards minorities in Singapore is an uphill task, since *some* will repeatedly deflect the issue and point towards how 'IT'S NOT RACIST IF IT'S ACTING'."
10196,"Also, it's obvious those people are not ready for a civil discussion on racism in Singapore (beyond this one case), but rather are merely sticking around to defend their point - that ""the actor is just playing the victim card, because this is not racism at all!!!""."
10197,"So as far as this Shrey and ABTM incident goes, it's all well and good that we're having a ""conversation"" about how racist this case is (if at all), but everyone should remember that while this one case may or may not be racist in your book, we're not enemies - we're all Singaporeans, so let's be more civil and open to discussion on the wider problems in society."
10198,I agree with you that is no room for racism and outward expressions of it in Singapore.
10199,My point is: not every Chinese person is a racist.
10200,I didn't really know it wasn't common until I grew up a bit more and began noticing stuff like this and it makes me sad that parents are teaching their children how to be racist.
10201,I feel some people just employ a maid to simply abuse them.
10202,There only a small minority that some wheelchair elderly abused these maids because of minor issues.
10203,"My family side always treat our maids with respect.Every sunday,we try to give them holiday.We do give them phone to call their family back home."
10204,"We used to have 3 maids before.all 3 maids were ok,but naturally they may not know how to cook or may not be used to the Singapore hdb lifestyle where everything we used are electric whereas back home,they are used to using wood to start a fire."
10205,"2 of our maids left for family reason & the other maid,we sent her back to the agency because she was always sleepy,doesn't do her job well."
10206,I notices that some families during meal time tend to eat separately with their maids even when eating outside.
10207,"Yes we know maids tend to distance themselves from their owner,but we as owner have to make them feel at home."
10208,"We also need to teach our children to respect maids,not teach them to control the maids."
10209,I feel that a lot of expats that haven't left yet have something of significance in Singapore (e.g a Partner) that's withholding their decision to leave.
10210,I feel that it is racist.
10211,"I feel that it is students from the lower classes that is the main source of xenophobia, and it sort of started to snowball during the mass layoffs in 2008-2014 of blue-collared Singaporean workers when the immigrant population boomed."
10212,"So lets just say, drawing from my own experience for example, if both your parents are out of jobs because there are immigrant workers saturating the market and racist bosses that only hire “their own kind”, and you have to go to school where foreign scholars constantly top the school in every subject and competition and get showered in praise by all the teachers, and *then* on top of that 60% of your olympics team are made out of foreigners that are only in it for the money, and *furthermore* the scholars mentioned earlier are going straight to uni while you have to serve 2 years protecting their asses, only for them to enter the workforce early and be your managers."
10213,"To some people, xenophobia is a form of civil disobedience."
10214,"Rather than directly challenging the government and get arrested and sued into bankruptcy, they direct their anger towards the new immigrants as a show of defiance against the government's decisions, and it is more prominent among hot-headed teenagers who believe that they face a bleak future."
10215,"I feel that just like many other things, racism exists in a spectrum."
10216,"Of course there will always be racism, but the question is how much is acceptable."
10217,It’s not about xenophobia or racism.
10218,"Even our foreign workers are being well taken-care of, all things considered."
10219,The problem Singaporean society has with immigrant workers nowadays seems to be more about how we can treat them better and  better acknowledge their contributions to our nation.
10220,The disparaging sentiments against immigrant workers shared here are old and more people are starting to outgrow them I feel.
10221,"It’s no small secret that our infrastructure is increasingly coming under strain due to more and more people working in Singapore, and I think we will need to have a hard look at how we can reduce the number of people in Singapore (which in turn means fewer foreign workers)."
10222,"As is pointed out below, if the construction industry could adopt more efficient modes of construction or pay more for locals, that would in turn cut down on our reliance on foreign workers."
10223,"I'm not saying we have to apologize and kiss boots for something that may or may not be happening, but being neutral and open to the possibility that it \*could\* be happening can lead to more productive outcomes and a good discussion that promotes understanding of the fact that Singapore may be more racist that we think, or of the fact that Singapore is less racist than \*they\* think, depending on the insights that might be uncovered."
10224,Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported?
10225,"My father have been rather blatant about his xenophobic tendencies, saying India/muslims deserves what they're getting etc."
10226,I feel there are racial undertones regarding the whole issue about CECA.
10227,"You can see the racist statements online; even in this thread people are spouting the same old ""Indians are casteist etc."""
10228,Quite a few people cannot do so and thats why most of the hate that was intended to be directed towards Indian expats have actually affected the local Indians.
10229,"For example, if the Government decides the need for more stringent vetting processes on foreign workers’ credentials as part of a new policy, can the Government reliably enforce it at individual level?"
10230,I feel very strongly she should report to the police that her maid ate the beehoon without permission
10231,"But I think it's better that the doggie has a rich owner who gets his maid to walk it, than a doggie with no home."
10232,I'll like to think a rich man's doggie doesn't mind a maid tugging at it sometimes if it gets to eat at Michelin star restaurants.
10233,"On a last note, just a personal thought but I wished as a society we had the same energy to eradicate some other issues like racism, poverty, climate change, etc..."
10234,"Whenever a new racist incident happens to me, I shelve it away in a ""cupboard"" of bad memories in my brain."
10235,"It's sad when we are at once on the receiving end of racism and then called out for being ""oversensitive"" when we try to stand up for ourselves."
10236,"Also ""ethnostress"" is a thing - the psychological effects of repeated racist experiences over one's life."
10237,I'm not Filipino but I look Filipino and people ask if I'm the maid when I accompany my parent to the hospital.
10238,"I felt completely disgusted at his attitude towards the maid, while I felt that both parties were in the wrong as the maid shouldn't have acted in an irritated manner, the 20 year old man was completely uncivilized in his actions and resorted to hurling insults at the maid and even throwing objects at her even after his father intervened."
10239,I think the vast majority of maids in Singapore are good people who are just trying to make better money than they could ever earn back home.
10240,I think the horror stories give the vast majority of good maids a bad name.
10241,"Obviously, we are not too happy that expatriates come in to take the jobs at the top of the pyramid and command high pays."
10242,It is debatable whether these expatriates are really irreplaceable due to their skills/talents but that's another topic for another day.
10243,I find certain pple saying they need Indians for cheap labour more racist
10244,I find it a lil repulsive the extent to which you are justifying the maid industry
10245,I've never been too bothered about what people call me (I share your views on casual racism) but I suppose tolerating the small racist phrases leaves room for more insidious behaviours to develop.
10246,"I find it hilarious that you can't cuss over there, but all the racist, sexist and xenophobic stuff are totally OK!"
10247,But by calling her foreign domestic worker does feel like Piang is just a number which I seriously doubt.
10248,I find it racist because it has a ridiculous portrayal if Japanese.
10249,I have written feedback to ask@publichygienecouncil.sg to ask them to take it down as it is racist and offends Japanese people.
10250,"Also from my observations due to the power structure there will never be a point where the employer will look at a maid with equal standing or treat them as a professional worker, they will forever be a lesser being to them."
10251,"I find it somewhat ironic when Singaporeans complain that maids are getting more expensive - asking for more pay and benefits - as supply is becoming limited and there's competition for maids already in SG when on the other hand, we are weighing what's the increment when we ourselves change employers."
10252,"I find myself becoming less racist, actually."
10253,I find our maid culture to be very unhealthy especially for some of the children growing up.
10254,"Maybe the mindset is better if maids are considered ""helpers"" rather than ""servants""."
10255,That's the reason why they encounter much more racism in these countries.
10256,"For example, I think being attracted to big doe eyes is not really on the same level as ‘I think slanty eyes are ugly’, which is obviously racist."
10257,However society is generally racist and hates immigrants and people of other religions/color (fear of unknown) and is unwilling to help others (selfishness is huge problem in my country).
10258,What does racism and selfishness have to do with Christianity or Jesus?
10259,"I find that some in Singapore, other than lacking empathy, seem to think they're doing their helpers/FDWs a favour by employing them."
10260,"Many FDWs come from decent families, but sometimes, due to circumstances, they end up in such a role."
10261,I've had friends tell me we're lucky that our maid is capable of self-control.
10262,"I find the whole concept of lowly paid live-in foreign maids repugnant, but this is not the only condo with these rules."
10263,"I find this post the  racist equivalent of ""humble bragging""."
10264,OP tryna disguise HIS own racist tendencies by repeating an unfair stereotype n presenting it as if he disagrees.
10265,"Just as there are people with varying levels of tolerance, there are also people with varying degrees of overt racism."
10266,"Not everyone is racist, and not everyone accepts others unconditionally."
10267,"The moment we attribute stereotypes and prejudices towards appearance, we move a step towards racism and unfairness."
10268,"It is the job of everyone when it comes to eradicating xenophobia, when you see racist acts being committed, remind them that this is a country not built on race."
10269,I firmly dislike the idea of a person being a racist/not a racist.
10270,"By your definition, a racist person and not-racist person can both do an offensive thing, but it’s only a racist action when the racist person is doing it, right?"
10271,But racism isn’t felt by the perpetrator.
10272,"And I’m pretty sure that whatever the intentions of the offender might be, that same action is gonna feel like racism, intentional or not."
10273,Is it incumbent on everyone who experiences a racist infraction to calmly explain that said action is racist to the perpetrator?
10274,"You’d have no idea if the person is racist or not (by your definition), and thereby receptive or not to acknowledging the offense."
10275,I flew back in December on a VTL flight and it was so packed.
10276,I had it booked for the date long in advance before the VTLs were announced so I was lucky.
10277,"Having said that I think the VTL flight price itself is worth it, especially if you want to go home and continue life instead of staying 10 days in a hotel, extending the amount of time away from family."
10278,"No doubt I believe that they do treat their maid well, but the level of pettiness of her complaints and expectations left me in awe."
10279,"Word of warning for everyone, any racism, mention of CECA, telling OP to go back to his country blah blah, and any breach in Rediquette will result in penalties."
10280,I found one example of an actual non-dorm foreign worker cluster.
10281,"But the report of the [first 6 cases](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/covid-19-update-april-15-4-clusters/) gave quite a lot of details, and they were 4 Bangladeshi, 1 Indian, and 1 Thai foreign workers; quite likely they got infected by colleagues who were dorm residents."
10282,There are racists agents out there.
10283,"However, my point is that it is never beneficial for agents to act out their racist tendencies even if they are a racist deep down."
10284,"There just isn't enough evidence that shows that the agent is racist, so is it not fair for him to direct his anger at the agent (i do agree that the tone of the reply is bad, but it's not racist.)"
10285,I really wish people would read thoroughly before commenting instead of jumping to conclusions like racism without fully understanding what was written and in what context.
10286,"I'm willing to bet that if you have maids the option to live in employers house, versus rent and travel- many would not take it."
10287,I gave the most important reason that it is not slavery- that maids have entered by choice and enjoy a salary that will benefit their families or their own living condition far in excess of what they can manage without.
10288,"Many Students get by on less allowance than a maid, and also have food and lodging provided by parents."
10289,"I earn quite comfortably to live well and you know, pay and treat my maid well, tyvm."
10290,I gave up arguing because 'xenophobic' and 'foreign workers build your HDB'
10291,"I generally find that replies calling your observations racist must have never rented out their home before, this is pretty spot on."
10292,I think he meant it in a non-racist way but couldn’t find a better context or example.
10293,"I get irritated by repetitive shitposts, not discussion of racism."
10294,"And it's not as if people who are already racist would lurk on Reddit, so harping on it here accomplishes nothing."
10295,"In this society we jump out of our chairs anytime a minority claims to be a victim of racism, forcing them to proving it and reporting them to the police."
10296,One can make the argument that you can't really be racist if you have no power.
10297,"I get it, Singaporeans don’t see their behavior toward domestic helpers as abusive."
10298,Anything and everything also racism?
10299,Those siaolang minority voices here crying racism will be the last people I support.
10300,I get that that's the stereotype about Chinese tourists behaving badly abroad but I have never actually seen any PRC immigrant do that with my own eyes.
10301,So I would really hesitate to say that this is something that PRC immigrants regularly do.
10302,I get that you have bad experience but how is it racism?
10303,"Don’t know about you, but I don’t have the prior intuition that Chinese females are somehow less racist than males."
10304,"I get the sentiment that using ""racist"" broadly risks trivialising the exact mischief the term is targeting but I really do feel there is room for Singaporeans here to overhaul our understanding of ""racism"", how it manifests at different levels and how to validate lived experiences and discard destructive instigations."
10305,"The problem we have now is that most people think that racism is predominantly externalised, individualised and explicit."
10306,"In other words, ""racist"" is what the state has conditioned for it to be - either by the language used by the media, the MRHA, the narrativisation of the spectre of racial riots (physical & overt), how it's constitutionally antonymous with ""public order"", and then some."
10307,"We need to expand the language of what ""racism"" *in Singapore* means, and before anyone brings in the bogeyman that is CRT, I'm strongly against the blind transplantation of that."
10308,"We need a serious re-evaulation of how racism and manifestations of it has evolved, and to do that we need to listen to the experience of minorities and guard against thinking that anything ""racist"" has to fulfil some sort of checklist sanctioned by national history, our laws, the government's narrative and majoritarian will."
10309,I get this type of vibe in the comment section on all of the videos/threads on the foreign workers
10310,"While I agree that most do not go out of their way to be explicitly racist, casual racism in the form these jokes that are loaded with assumptions are largely internalised subconsciously."
10311,I get where you're coming from but you can't deny that there has been a recent uptick in racist incidents in sg.
10312,"The same discussion can be had about racism, tbh."
10313,"The dictionary definition of racism includes systemic racism, but most people don’t think of that when they hear the word racism."
10314,"They think of slurs and clear cut discrimination, when that is really only a small part of what racism is."
10315,"That said there is clearly more than a negligible minority that engages in racist behaviour here, so I’m certain that some of the voices declaring “no racism or Chinese privilege here” are bad faith asshats."
10316,"As unpopular and not politically correct as it is, I feel that the split into different mother tongues is holding our development back."
10317,"And then, most of us cannot even converse in our mother tongue at this level anyway."
10318,Higher cost means less hiring of maids in Singapore.
10319,"Anecdotally, I heard some horror maid stories and some horror employer stories."
10320,I go by dictionary definition of racism.
10321,"Racism is no doubt present in the US (especially now there have been more racist incidents against Asians due to COVID), but it really depends where you go."
10322,"Living in Southern California for 4 years, I’ve never had a single issue with racism and discrimination, mostly because SoCal is extremely diverse."
10323,There's just not a lot of point to labeling everything as racist/sexist and take away its meaning.
10324,"If everyone is racist, then it's just the natural order of things and we have no problem here to discuss."
10325,I got pretty sick of the racism too.
10326,scratch the surface and ignorant racism bleeds out.
10327,"But, I've seen many facets of these nice people where racism and materialism comes out... uncomfortably."
10328,"When I hear racist xenophobic banter from the locals in sg, its pretty hard for me to tell them to the truth of their ignorance or to just shut their trap."
10329,"How far we've fallen, now that we can ""afford"" to be racist."
10330,I got to agree with Mel (a Filipino living in Singapore who was interviewed) that foreign workers were neglected before the coronavirus crisis.
10331,"Singapore is more tourist/expat friendly which works for me, especially for my future retirement choice."
10332,"I guess I didn’t mean to imply the agents themselves were racists but in my frustration they were the channel to the landlords who had employed the discriminatory views, which were also not stated outright in the advertisements."
10333,I just mentioned I don’t work with racists to imply that it’s fine I don’t need the property once they outright stated the landlord doesn’t want Indians.
10334,I guess I have a pretty thick skin and an armoury of defensive racist statements.
10335,"Also, within Indians, racism is both ways man (or 3 way if you include the Asiatics from the Northeast)."
10336,"India is probably way worse than singapore in terms of racism directed at africans and east Asians, but that's only to be expected because it's still living in older times"
10337,"As long as those advertisements are racist-free, I have no issue with that."
10338,"I guess I wouldn't consider that part of an ""expat package"" when moving to a lower-tax country like Singapore because it's a disadvantage for the employee."
10339,"I do wonder how many companies implement that or instead, especially for infrequent expats, what is apparently actually called ""tax protection"", where the employee pockets the tax decrease rather than handing it over to the employer."
10340,"But with that, again this doesn't require an expat package when moving to a lower-tax country."
10341,"I tell them it's case of racism (my friend and I were Indian, driver Chinese) and I'm unhappy at being made to wait over 25mins."
10342,I guess VTLs are needed more for foreigners than Singaporeans.
10343,"I guess a more nuanced view is that racism isn't controversial, but policies may be controversial due to potentially being racist, or even as a result of trying to confront racism itself."
10344,"And Singapore's efforts to tackle racism should be by all means recognized, but an impt thing to note is that minorities ultimately have a say in what they feel is racist, and they should speak up if they feel what we've done is not enough"
10345,"I guess blue collar workers tend to be more racist and bigoted, not the first time I've heard something like that regarding the maritime sector."
10346,"I guess for foreign workers, if your company is going so far to increase your wages to meet the criteria you are have skills they are willing to pay, or has enough friends in high places to stay in Singapore."
10347,I guess giving an A- shows the contempt in which you hold the lives of migrant workers.
10348,I guess his sentencing would have been different if it was a German / American or French expat going to work.
10349,It's the same in Singapore -- I witnessed less overt racism amongst my peers the older I got.
10350,"But I definitely think that most Londoners and British people have been very warm, very welcoming, very polite, I have never been made to feel explicitly unwelcome; of course there those racist scumbags that you read about in the news who think it's ok to beat up people based on their skin color - I've never met any of those."
10351,"Whether it is as an analyst, developer, or some other role, I will obtain an employment pass."
10352,I guess it really depends on how difficult the language test is.
10353,"Most PRCs coming into Singapore today who manage to get PR and citizenship (not work permit holders, they have no path to citizenship) can also speak broken English if theyre forced to."
10354,"I suspect that there is considerable overlap in English ability between the white collar PRC immigrants that we've been taking in in recent years and working class Malaysian immigrants, if it's based on test results."
10355,"Honestly if the concern is just PRCs not assimilating, then a country specific quota may make more sense than one based on language tests."
10356,The latter does smell of racism.
10357,I personally disagree as well since obviously expats do not need to serve NS for one.
10358,I'm cool with casual racism but it can get pretty out of hand with some of my friends.
10359,"Mostly and not being the racist here , the people who do disturb me are chinese."
10360,"I guess it’s the amdk vs sinkie thing again, but except we didn’t care about the foreign workers in the first place and the next, we care about this."
10361,"I guess my point came off wrong i was not thinking straight but yeah, all im saying is racism is racism."
10362,It would take another world war for human to remember anti-globalization / anti-immigrant / anti-trade will only lead to destruction and wars.
10363,"I guess when you go to Malaysian and get beaten up by racist thugs, you would be satisifed with the Malaysian police saying   ""Why should Malaysians be concerned with what a Singaporean says?"
10364,"If you were ever in those circles, you will hear some of the most hateful, racist, xenophobic and discriminatory things."
10365,"And there are plenty of examples of harmonious behavior in Singapore between races, despite the racism and xenophobia that does exist."
10366,"I had a domestic helper growing up and my mum did the same to ""prevent her from running away""."
10367,Singapore has a lot to learn when it comes to treating domestic helpers as humans - and we should start with recognising them under MOM's Employment Act to charge employers who don't comply.
10368,"- One about SG having zero $ external debt  - One interesting study from LKY school of public policy  - One asking about racism (based on my experiences in SG and the past)  - One factual article, ~2006."
10369,"I had a racist encounter about 18 years ago, when my husband was still my boyfriend."
10370,I had a very good experience with a kind migrant worker.
10371,Then a migrant worker asked me from his lorry whether I needed a lift -- I was very grateful to him.
10372,I had a very similar argument with my mom when I was in secondary school and the decision was made to send the maid back to Philippines.
10373,He certainly didn’t teach his child to be racist or to say something like that.
10374,Most expat mid-managers don't get a housing benefit.
10375,* I don't like the dogwhistle-y tone of specifically naming CECA.
10376,"It just strikes me as being not much better than the SDP's ""say no to foreign workers"" pledge."
10377,I had no idea maids earned so little.
10378,Some of the comments were downright bigoted and racist.
10379,I had the exact same experience with my 14 year Indonesian maid and she bacame a total bitch (even the threatening to not renew contract part).
10380,"Basically, your maid has stayed with you for too long, so the line between being a maid and a family member has blurred too much, and her job position has become too secure."
10381,The amount of racism in Singapore is lowkey high.
10382,I had the unfortunate instance to snoop at the conversation of few women with Indian accent who were complaining their maid wants access to the toilet and not use the clubhouse toilet which is downstairs    WTF?
10383,I had to let my domestic worker go and we went back to the same agency to assist us in finding another employer since she wants to work for another 2 years here.
10384,"Today however, a month after the deal was done, we met again with our ex-domestic worker, and she told us that the agency is going to deduct one month of her salary for the transfer."
10385,"I had to work and manage a group of foreign workers as part of my job description for a period of time, this means I also have access to their dorms."
10386,"**  The construction industry has a shortage of workers, that's no secret, especially with COVID travel restrictions."
10387,My FIL (it's a family business) is so close to the foreign workers employed by the company he goes and celebrates Hari Raya with them.
10388,"Still nothing wrong for trying to address what you felt was racist (and I give support to the man for calling out queue jumpers), but whether what happened after could be done differently, or if it's anyones fault we can never tell."
10389,"You are an immigrant, period, regardless of your job or ses."
10390,I hate the culture behind maids in this country.
10391,There are maids in both of my grandparent's houses.
10392,"Believing in flawed understandings of the roots of the problem (""some Singaporeans are assholes to maids because of a colonial mentality"") will lead to incoherent solutions that don't work (""if we decolonise our mindsets, Singaporeans would no longer be assholes to maids"")."
10393,"I hate to break it to you now man, but we have way bigger problems than some maids having to stay at home."
10394,"Frankly, some sad maids stuck at home is not a priority, neither is teaching them how to send money home a priority."
10395,No one gives a shit about maids now.
10396,"We should stop teaching mother tongue in schools and all learn how to code in C#, C++, Java, Python instead."
10397,I hate to sound racist but I think their culture doesn't have much room for hygiene in general.
10398,Those situations that are out of my control are really other dog owners/domestic helpers not being able to control their own dogs.
10399,"Do maids really need a set of special instructions saying ""Treat dogs kindly!""?"
10400,I have 2 kids and I need a maid.
10401,"My parents are self-employed and work night shifts, while I am currently still a student, so we hired a domestic worker to help look after her."
10402,"However, she treats the domestic worker like crap and thinks that the worker is out to get her all the time."
10403,Our maid has to wake up AT LEAST thrice throughout the night to help her relieve herself.
10404,"She also wakes up at 7-8am daily and begin the day by shouting at the maid, waking the whole family up."
10405,"Our maid would help her wash up in the morning, and 1 hour later, she would accuse the maid of not helping her wash up."
10406,Throughout the whole day she would ask the maid if dinner was ready.
10407,"She would have her meal and 1 hour later, forget all about it, and accuse the maid of starving her."
10408,"During the meal, she would accuse the food tastes like crap and proceed to scold the maid again."
10409,I have a Canadian French friend who takes third language French as her mother tongue
10410,I have a disagreement with your explanation of racism but agree with your description of how integrated we are generally.
10411,"While yes racism is inevitable in most countries, and our older generations influence us by passing down folktales etc, I'm not really sure why you think you need to justify racism by also stating the way you believe Northern Indians behave?"
10412,"What's the point of acting racist towards them in that situation, just treat them with accordance to the law and call the police?"
10413,"If someone is not humble, then is that grounds for racism?"
10414,"There is racism in school, in NS, in higher education, at employment, in housing etc but it's not that EVERYONE experiences it ALL the time."
10415,"It's important though, to point out that even though no one experiences racism when a malay or Indian tries to buy food from the Chinese stall, it's the important junctures in life where race REALLY matters, and so it should not be discounted even if it is not highly frequent."
10416,"If youve not seen this study, do check it out, I'm relatively sure it can be extrapolated to Indians as well: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-pacific-rim-psychology/article/racism-and-the-pinkerton-syndrome-in-singapore-effects-of-race-on-hiring-decisions/5924D22CCF6F71558B5DE9002CDBA12F"
10417,I have a few racists to intro you
10418,"When I brought up that the best thing about my VTL trip to Malaysia was that besides masks and checking-in, there were barely any more restrictions and also no constant in-your-face reminders of the pandemic anymore."
10419,Not all that controversial in the expat community...  Only drink with friends who stop you before booze turns you into an asshole.
10420,I have a lot of older relatives who hire maids.
10421,When I was a child I remember one of my grandaunts dragged her crying maid onto the floor and poured some strong disinfectant or kerosene on her head when the maid refused to de-lice her hair after came back from Indonesia as a precaution.
10422,"Many of the older Chinese gen think nothing of barking at maids, making the maid clean 3 houses plus their workplace or making them eat plain bread for meals, because they like to think of themselves as 少爷 and 少奶奶."
10423,I am fine with casual racism since pretty much i grew up having friend calling this & that.
10424,I have a maid and a babysitter for my 15mths yo daughter.
10425,Once I gave a meal to my maid and my mom took it away from her because it is still good.
10426,The babysitter no longer sneak her phone during playtime and the maid no longer talks on her phone while ironing (electricity bills man).
10427,"My point is, if you ever have maids or helpers, you really need to set the boundaries while still respecting their dignity both at home an in public."
10428,"Recently, my neighbour filed a police report about my domestic helper saying that she scolded her."
10429,"If not, it's no wonder you don't experience any racism."
10430,I'm worried about the US or Singapore imposing some kind of travel restriction that will force me to come home early.
10431,"Like it or not, we have to err on the side of non-racism."
10432,"I have always been of the opinion that Singapore should either phase out the industry of having maids (domestic helpers, or whatever PR-lingo they use now), or drastically increase the amount of regulations over it so that it is on par with butlers and nannies in other countries."
10433,"&#x200B;  Other developed countries also have working parents on both sides, and get along just fine in life without having a maid."
10434,"If it is deemed impossible in Singapore, then it says more about the work culture here then the need for domestic helpers."
10435,I have always wondered if it is worth engaging with racists or simply just leave it and walk off.
10436,"For everyone, really; elders, children, parents, workers, immigrants... we are all trying to get by the best we can."
10437,Courtesy of the type of immigrants from France to quebec back in the days.
10438,I have an aunt who likes to berate my maid.
10439,I have an employment pass.
10440,A couple of weeks after I started the job here in Singapore got a letter for an appointment to go get my picture and fingerprints taken for your physical employment pass.
10441,My school only offered chinese as mother tongue and his dad sent him there for convenience.
10442,I have seen a lot of extreme literature posted on the internet on how to demand the government limit the amount of foreigners they let in to how to treat a foreign worker as badly as possibly but marginally within the confines of the law.
10443,Do you hang out with racist people?
10444,"The recent incidents against Indians may have been prompted by an underlying animosity towards foreigners (worsened due to Covid 19) but in the end, more Indian-Singaporeans were on the receiving end of these racist attacks rather than Indian expats."
10445,The misinformation surrounding CECA is the primary reason for this in my opinion.
10446,"While I completely understand the rationale behind reviewing and updating policy/agreements periodically, singling out CECA out of all 26 FTAs seems racially motivated."
10447,While I know lower-wage workers do not get EPs and nor are their occupations relevant to CECA I just want to highlight this observation.
10448,This is partly the reason why I think there is a racial element to the whole CECA issue.
10449,These are my primary views/observations about the CECA issue.
10450,I started typing this out after I heard Mr Leong Mun Wai's arguments about CECA and consequently seeing some provocative comments in the youtube comments section.
10451,"I don’t think people are xenophobic as much as they are tired of perceived unfairness, such as being made to serve 2 years of NS (plus 10 years of ICT), or slogging through 3-4 years of university, while foreigners don’t have to deal with the burden of NS, or are evidently coming in with dodgy degrees purchased through degree mills."
10452,"Instead of addressing these issues head on, the government is instead trying to deflect by portraying these outbursts as acts of racism or xenophobia."
10453,I have been provided this as an option for expat housing.
10454,Im not too happy with foreign workers coming in taking our position in the PMET.. but will that help us in foreign relations?
10455,I have been to America before and that confusion seems to be based on ignorance than racism.
10456,"I have been to a number of dormitories, even multiple times in a single dormitory and it is simply not as abysmal as how you portray it to be."
10457,I've gone to some residential houses where the conditions are worse than a dormitory.
10458,I have fellow Singaporeans telling me that being able to employ maids at such a cheap rate and having so much power over them is a benefit that our government gives us.
10459,My friend bought 4 crabs and insisted that the waiter was being racist while gobbling them down.
10460,"I have had expat coworkers who fled back to their home countries when SG initially had an outbreak, then fled back here when the COVID situation in their home countries exploded while SG had the situation under control."
10461,"I have heard of the same story as well, but then you see some of those Unilateral VTLs like with Denmark(was it) and Indonesia."
10462,"Why can't Singapore start a unilateral VTL with Japan is truly beyond me, when Japan's number has been so low(abnormally so)."
10463,I have heard several claims from both native Singaporeans and expats that there is a passive dislike of working foreigners.
10464,I have just enough with people to you who compare aging countries without vaccine with a country that has 30 percent people which are immigrants and in lower age brackets.
10465,"Given that food and lodging are provided, is a FDW paid a living wage in singapore, with enough to send back to her family, who can grow rich off the pay?"
10466,My FDW has managed to buy 3 houses back in her home country in 2 years.
10467,"I have long maintained that if this really gets out of hand, our migrant workers would be the only ones to survive because of their herd immunity."
10468,It’s a bit like the joke that domestic helpers will be the only ones to live through an air raid given many are made to sleep in the home shelter.
10469,I have never approved of the maid culture here because it opens up cases where people outright exploit their maids.
10470,Singaporeans have such unrealistic expectations of maids.
10471,You are paying maids an annual salary that's barely worth more than some people's monthly salary.
10472,There are alternatives than hiring a maid.
10473,Oh and please don't hire a maid to take care of a sick elderly.
10474,"What I did say is, even if it is racism, it is not related to Chinese."
10475,To say that this post is motivated by xenophobia is ridiculous.
10476,But based on what you said asking a particular race a bigger deposit is somehow less racist?
10477,I don’t believe I am racist.
10478,But I do make and receive jokes that may be deemed racist in nature.
10479,People who are offended by racist comments and jokes need to recognise that their personal offence does not make it wrong for someone else to make certain comments.
10480,I have never understood what is upsetting about someone making a racist comment to you.
10481,Is it because you believe that the commentator is racist?
10482,Let’s be clear that racism is wrong.
10483,Tangible racism matters in that it denies you opportunities and fair treatment.
10484,"However, racist comments and jokes are completely different."
10485,I have never understood why people abuse their domestic helpers.
10486,"When I was young, my domestic helper stayed with us for almost 15 years until she decided she was tired and old and wishes to return back to Indo."
10487,Seeing maid abuse cases in Singapore is just a sad thing to see.
10488,They're definitely having a better life and getting paid more being a cleaner vs being a domestic helper.
10489,I'm not so sure if domestic helpers could apply for jobs in Singapore and quit being a domestic helper.
10490,"I have no idea what ya talking about, an American can just point a gun at you and say racist shit to you and dare you to argue with him."
10491,"In Singapore, you can verbally fight back against racist without worrying about losing your life."
10492,The racists are usually the pro guns who believe in their own militia and all and have no issues shooting you and claim its self defense because you got hostile.
10493,It's almost impossible for an Indian to come here to work (unless they're FDWs) and not be able to speak in English.
10494,"In case you don't know, FDWs are not allowed to start a family here."
10495,Some people have been spending a lot of time commenting on posts of racial incidents arguing the following:  1) the incident shouldn't be labelled as racism 2) the situation in Singapore isn't as bad as it seems.
10496,"I have noticed over the past few months (maybe even a year or more) that when random bag checks are carried out at MRTs, they tend to be for Indian / Bangladeshi migrant workers."
10497,"I would really love to know how many times have you been targeted base on your color/race, or any racist situation?"
10498,This has led to trends such as requiring foreign talent to 'fill in the gaps' and encouragement to switch career tracks.
10499,I have reformed my pronunciation of CECA!
10500,"Imagine if they thought the same way as these racists during the Japanese occupation, and refused to raise the babies that Chinese families gave away."
10501,All of this is very conveniently forgotten by the present day racists.
10502,"I have said before, the concept of having maids is akin to modern day ""slavery"" albeit hyperbole."
10503,I don't hire maid precisely of this reason.
10504,There is a need to allow maids to live their own lives and pay them more.
10505,The culture of having maids is really a toxic one from what I have seen.
10506,There are currently no laws protecting maids in terms of working hours.
10507,"There is no ""minimum"" level of standards for the maids besides the weekly off days."
10508,"I have seen a maid of my friend had to masturbate him,and that was like blackmail because she had a Bangladeshi boyfriend,this was in my secondary school years.i straight up avoid him."
10509,Buay tahan  Influencers don't even want to talk about the racism in our own backyard but love to preach about social justice.
10510,"BLM is a very important movement; blacks have been subject to profiling police brutality, unfair outcomes in criminal justice trials (esp compared to whites), and all sorts of systemic racism."
10511,And I think we shouldn't go about doing too much whataboutery - what about racism on our shores?
10512,"When people talked about migrant workers and almost //all// radio stations asked people to donate their $600 to migrant workers, one might argue, what about singaporeans who have lost their jobs, who are even more desperately poor and at wits end, why encourage an en masse donation to one particular group?"
10513,One can care about both blacks and both racism on our shores.
10514,"And so when the time comes when something else makes the headlines, something to do with singapore's racism, call these people out on it."
10515,Ask them why they are so willing to support blacks then but refuse to support anti-racism in Singapore.
10516,"What I **cannot stand** however, is influencers/anyone saying to SINGAPOREANS that if you don't support the BLM you're complicit in the oppression of blacks, or to equate in some sense american racism and singapore racism (not in the sense of whataboutery but more like importing the same severity)."
10517,"Yes, racism in Singapore exists."
10518,"But it'd be wrong for influencers to equate it to american racism - I can't quantify severity, obviously, but clearly it's not backed by the same horrifying history."
10519,"Checking on the Malaysia Airport regarding [VTL](https://airports.malaysiaairports.com.my/covid-information/vaccinated-travel-lane-air-between-malaysia-and-singapore), it has this statement: ""*Transfer/transit passengers will not be allowed on these designated flight services.*""."
10520,"It is not only the Indian expats, we have other nationalities taking up white collar jobs."
10521,"Hey my fellow Singaporeans in Reddit who called out the racist behaviours, do you think I am one of those uneducated, din put in efforts racist?"
10522,"I have this next block neighbour, they always shout and scold their maid about things like her hygiene (yes I can hear it because they are always at the kitchen and it’s near a window)."
10523,Take my grandma’s maids for example.
10524,I have to say it differs from maid to maid.
10525,The maid who brought me up came from Kampong too and is treated very well.
10526,"However, for people who know some foreign workers, many said that they would stay away from the dorms because of the unsanitary conditions."
10527,"I worked with them for 1.5 years before and you could see 5 foreign workers doing one simple task, which was painting the line, with one person painting and the other four watching."
10528,"To be a maid in singapore, they do undergo strict training and tests before they are allowed to work here."
10529,"For us to trust a stranger in our house, it's actually a very big deal, and the maid will benefit from the financial benefit greatly by working here, so she has incentive to not abuse that trust."
10530,"The maid could be influenced to be allowed into the house, and the boyfriend could steal items without even the knowledge of the maid."
10531,"He has, after all, nothing that he owes to the maid, or the household."
10532,"The maids are here to work, and if the employer has strictly made it clear that seeing someone else is not allowed, that is totally fine."
10533,"It's not only maids, companies can have regulations against people in the same department having relationships."
10534,"It's not out of line to stop employing someone if their personal relationships can potentially affect their work, and it is 100% applicable to these maids."
10535,I have worked with 15 CECA professionals from 4 different companies.
10536,And they are not the foreign talent you speck of.
10537,How many CECA professionals have you worked with?
10538,"I havent heard singlish in person for 2.5 years and almost forgot what other singaporeans sounded like and the first time I heard singlish again from the pilots and air stewardesses on the VTL flight back I nearly cried tears of joy ""MI FAMILIA"""
10539,"my point was specially to the poster above me earlier who was asking why Thailand, with a higher vax rate than Indonesia and India were not selected for this VTL."
10540,"In fact, i’m all for opening up VTL with the entire Asean."
10541,"I hear [this statistic](http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2012/06/01/singapore-no-1-for-millionaires-again/) from time to time, [most recently in a TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ou1s5/til_singapore_has_the_worlds_highest_percentage/) and I was wondering whether or not the statistic is actually a valid one or its artificially inflated due to rich immigrants."
10542,immigrants who get permanant residency or citizenship here to avoid taxes?
10543,"Upon returning, I was shocked at how rampant casual racism is here - and especially what I experienced during NS, including:  * Was told to my face that 'Indians are lazy, you need to work harder' * Was told that my deodorant was smelled 'too Indian' and that I should change it (it was literally just Axe/Adidas from the supermarket) * (by a superior) 'eh, if you work for me under the sun, later your skin become blacker, I off the lights then how to see you ah?'"
10544,"And when I confronted some of the perpetrators, I was told - like OP said in his post - that it isn't racist, that I'm being sensitive, etc etc."
10545,"This is all, of course, in addition to other casual racism - people getting up and moving seats on the bus/train, getting noticeably discriminatory service at a luxury goods store, Grab drivers and store attendants assuming that I'm not Singaporean and treating me differently because of it, and the list goes on."
10546,"It was absolutely horrifying for me - and honestly, deeply hurtful - to come back to my own country and  experience such casual racism, from a foreign country where I was treated more or less equally."
10547,I heard differently from other expat parents - it's much more affordable to have kids in Singapore due to the fact we have access to live-in helper and daycare that are less expensive.
10548,"I heard from a friend who work delivery jobs that in some condos, they and domestic workers are told to take ""the other lift"", because the main lift is for resident and guests only."
10549,I heard the Chinese in China are pretty racist towards black people
10550,"I heard the news segment on the radio while driving during lunch hour, I think first maid gets 9k and second maid gets 7k or thereabouts."
10551,I highly doubt you will find anybody here who claims that abusing maids is ok.
10552,"Do you have an issue with employers mistreating maids, or with the very practice of hiring foreign workers/maids?"
10553,"I hired a maid in march 2020, lasted three weeks."
10554,"Hiring a maid is an increased chance of bankruptcy, if she get seriously ill or into a serious accident."
10555,2 Years with the covid lockdown and I finally gave in and hired another maid last month.
10556,The main reason to hire a maid is to help out with my x2 twins two years old.
10557,I had a choice hire an inexperienced maid at a lower salary or hire a more experienced maid.
10558,We chose a 44 year old maid with over 6 years of experience taking care of kids in two consecutive three year terms.
10559,If the maid lives out.
10560,I honestly can't believe some fuckers here think that the living conditions of the maid is acceptable.
10561,"The link between racism and wealth is also not very straightforward, because racism also affects rich members of a racial minority - race is visible, wealth less so."
10562,"I honestly think it’s so ironic that the citizens of a country most of whose forefathers themselves emigrated from other countries (or escaped rather) to the Malay peninsula back in the day, have the audacity to  be xenophobic against foreigners who want to immigrate tonSingapore now."
10563,For fuck’s sake Singapore is a young country and was founded by immigrants and has prospered because of them too.
10564,You’re too naive if you think “too many immigrants” have put Singaporeans at a disadvantage.
10565,"Stupid, ignorant, and offensive to some, but not INTENTIONALLY racist."
10566,Though they might not since the SAF is already an openly racist organization.
10567,I hope MOH didnt forget about our migrant workers.
10568,"Growing up now, the memory was tarnished and stained by the recent racist incidents."
10569,"People might say I haven't go outside to the real world and say that whatever I'm thinking in my head is delusional or childish, and that there is no such thing as racism."
10570,"This is a multi racial country, mother tongue you do it at home but political debate on live tv must and always be english."
10571,The H1B visas are non-immigrant visas that allow firms to bring in skilled workers/professions for jobs that they cannot find a US resident to fill.
10572,I hope she's banned from hiring maids.
10573,"I hope that WP or the opposition in general would just change tact and instead of harping about ""foreign talent"", harp about how poor skills future is as a program and how a more targeted approach is needed to really equip employees with skills."
10574,I hope that maid in your post is well.
10575,I hope they don’t treat this as people mischaracterizing CECA and getting angry for no good reason.
10576,I hope they get pressured by such international press news to review their terrible treatment of foreign workers
10577,"I hope this can be an inflection point for some people to realize that racism is not just confined to the ""Beow Tans"" of society and that there are people in position in power, no less an educator, people who appear to be impartial, who can espouse seriously disparaging comments."
10578,I hope this is enough to show people that you don’t have to be a dumbfuck to be a racist.
10579,"I can Assume this guy is a father, could’ve taught his kids to be racist too."
10580,"I can understand the racists - most of the time, they're just folk who harbour resentment against people different from them."
10581,"""You're not getting physically harmed so it's not real racism."""
10582,"My prime motive indeed is the power dynamics of the relationship,   Like I said elsewhere, the FDWs are largely at the whims of their employer."
10583,"While I can draw comparisons between my cushy 9 to 5 job's employer's relation to myself and my FDW, I'd wager that you'd agree it's absurd."
10584,"> Zhou was granted an employment pass on Nov 4, 2019, based on the confirmation on the application form."
10585,"I've worked with migrant workers before and the shit they have to take daily from our locals will never cease to amaze me, not to mention the exploitation."
10586,Don't most FDWs earn more than the construction workers?
10587,I identify the same way you do and I consider English my mother tongue.
10588,"domestic workers, house wives)."
10589,"I will likely be moving to Singapore next year (for three years), and I'm in the midst of finalizing an expat package."
10590,I don’t even consider Chinese as my mother tongue considering I speak Cantonese Everyday at home anyway.
10591,"However, due to the mechanics of the VTL scheme, I have travel insurance, and this visit is also to visit a client."
10592,"I just checked, there is no plan for “full insurance” being offered for work permit holders on the market."
10593,I don’t rmb seeing non VTL flight for Australia but I paid $650 for scoot with no food but 20/40kg check in.
10594,"Airlines aren’t earning during the covid and before VTL, they will definitely increase the price for all VTL flights!"
10595,If your grandparents are immigrants or if you are an immigrant yourself is it unreasonable to think that you might be more sympathetic to new immigrants?
10596,I just feel that we Singaporeans are unknowingly short-changing ourselves in not getting the Government implement better policies for family-raising because maids exist as a band-aid.
10597,"Even to the point where Singapore has managed to keep a good international image partly thanks to this simple trick: ""community cases"" do not include foreign workers (who, BTW, are not the same as foreign talents)."
10598,The most depressing part is that some of them are actually proud of their inability to speak their mother tongue and still maintain this “so what?” attitude.
10599,"Tbh the hardest thing was knowing which flight was VTL on United Airlines, they only tell you after you book it 🤨"
10600,I just lament the fact that we used to crack racist jokes at each other and we remained friends.
10601,"I just like to click into these threads to see comments by the usual xenophobic ""fuck foreigners"" crowd  Anyway I'm PR here but I'm hoping to at least ask my employers if I can be stationed overseas for 2-3 months."
10602,So say a maid earns $2 an hour here.
10603,"So basically if she can't have the skills for a $10/hr job here, she can make more as a maid here than she can working back home."
10604,"These have been formulated in consultation with all relevant Government agencies; and informed by MPs, who have worked with us on foreign worker issues."
10605,"I thought from the headline that the writer was using CRT to justify increased racism, and that is hypocritical if you're going to accuse LGBT folk of importing Western ideas when CRT is itself a western idea and being gay is not."
10606,I just wanna point out again that there are bad families and there are bad maids.
10607,"Just like how you (as a parent) would approach the subject of your daughter having crush on a boy at her school, you should do the same with the maid."
10608,Even if my parents are not racists it shouldnt be said ever.
10609,I hope one day the newer generations are able to change the current outlook of systemic racism in SG and educate the ignorant ones (the older generation and future generations) so that our next generation can live without facing these casual and systemic racism.
10610,In my experience I haven't noticed the casual xenophobia that I've sometimes heard from Singaporeans.
10611,"On black people/culture, there are still major hurdles for them to overcome from centuries of racism and poverty, but it's nothing like a slave underclass."
10612,"I just want to point out that there are still foreign workers living in the weirdest of areas, like farms and CARPARKS and I hope that they will be safe because every time I see the confusion in their eyes when they come for appointment, I wish there was something else that I could have done to alleviate that."
10613,"you can't just hire a second maid willy-nilly, you have to meet certain criteria: https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-permit-for-fdw/how-do-i-apply-for-a-second-fdw"
10614,"Not overt hostile racism but ""jokes""."
10615,"They were living a relatively comfortable life (had a car, both parents were employed , has a piano in the house, able to hire a maid) and hence struggle with their changing financial situation(father lost job, lost money playing stocks, unable to find a job because of a lack of qualifications, mother constantly stresses over job security)."
10616,"And like a bad sitcom/soap opera plot that wishes to show the growing dysfunction in a family, the film has the mother constantly pouting and showing resentment at the maid who she thinks is taking over her role in the household, in case you missed all those other scenes of the maid and the son bonding and the son overtly expressing his affection for the maid."
10617,"While you may argue that as supporting characters this is a cliche one can afford to abide, I felt that this was especially bad for the film because the negative space created by their neglect defines the state of the relationship between the boy and his maid."
10618,"And as a Singaporean, we all know of the urban legends(well maybe not so much legend as fact) of children who grow so attached to their maid that the domestic worker effectively displace the mother as the maternal figure."
10619,I thought that one of the tropes that Chen could have fleshed out is the conflict/stability which the maid as an alien figure in an already dysfunctional family can bring.
10620,"All this could have been avoided however, if there was a proper resolution to the dynamic shift that the maid brought about."
10621,"Instead, like a bad sitcom endeavouring to wrap up the plot(again) the source of conflict is conveniently sent away because the family could not afford to pay the maid anymore."
10622,"I felt that this film is somewhat redeemed in the director's ability to capture poignancy in the little vignettes of the characters lives, from the maid's helplessness and isolation and the son's admirable child like loyalty to the memory of his grandfather."
10623,"I just went to Turkey on a non VTL flight for a holiday, the additional cost of 3 pcrs (125 sgd x 2 in SG and 40 sgd x 1 at IST) feels worth it for me, especially when there is no need for a follow up and quarantine."
10624,I keep mentioning that Singaporeans are racist AF (and sexist too).
10625,"You're *wrong*, this kind of racism fuels the likes of Trumpettes and Brexidiots."
10626,And people upvote because it supports the narrative that they've built in their heads and helps them blame the invisible govt-expat nexus.
10627,If the average wage of an Singaporean family is around $10k a month how much would you propose we pay these FDW?
10628,"I keep seeing those complaints online too but I personally find all this talk very xenophobic; these people want MNC culture, reject local firm culture, but want more local hires."
10629,"On one hand, I feel the government needs to really think twice about opening the floodgates to foreign talents and trying to artificially grow the population at all costs."
10630,"On the other hand, the rally's use of themes like CECA and ██████ (which is Ramesh) tingles my minority senses, as it feels like dog-whistle racial politics."
10631,"It seems to be a jab towards ""darker skinned"" FTs, echoing kinda the racist undertones of this rally."
10632,""", why must specifically point to CECA/Ramesh, if the point is hatred towards classist/snobby FTs?"
10633,"But as soon as their relationship was uncovered, many of his Gay Chinese friends kept telling him why he shouldn't date a non-Chi (most of the reasons being outright racist or ignorant)."
10634,"Weekend clubbing or get together became nightmare for him, since he can't bring his bf and be in the same place as his racist circle of friends."
10635,"Of not standing up against the racism, and missing out on an opportunity in working a relationship with the first person he knew he was romantically and emotionally attracted to."
10636,I know a couple of new immigrants who don't fall under the traditional CMIO category.
10637,A Korean lady who grew up in Singapore and attended public schools took Chinese as her mother tongue.
10638,An Indonesian dude I knew actually took French as his mother tongue because he could already speak and write Bahasa Indonesia quite well and he was not an ethnic Malay or Chinese.
10639,I know a few expats who are pissed off because the government closed the borders.
10640,"I have seen enough foreigners who treated the country who gave you scholarship and so much opportunity with disrespect and when locals spoke up, they were seen as xenophobic."
10641,"The maid situation here which is disgusting etc.. Having grown up in older cities in northern Europe, I'm with you there."
10642,I know it is beneficial to know a lot than less but i am asking this is because we keep hearing things like how sg working language is english etc etc those kind of thing that make me wonder if that is so why FORCED us to know mother tongue?
10643,Can you think of any major issues why one may not want to be an expat in Singapore?
10644,"So, what I can say is that, they are not alone and I know the migrant workers are having it worse."
10645,"He commonly abuses my mother, and he also has a relationship with other maids (cheating essentially)."
10646,"I know I am Chinese and definitely privileged, I’ve been bullied before but not due to racism, so I will never understand how it feels like for people of other races."
10647,"But I would say, maybe we can use this can a conversation starter, like “hey it’s happening in the US, maybe there’s something we can do about racism in Singapore as well."
10648,"I know of a family who’d only give their maid 15 minutes to eat, cook and rest."
10649,I know of a few expats who accepted their companies' offer to work here as they had wished to use Singapore as a base to travel the SEA region.
10650,I know of a few friends who have paid for their domestic helpers education or subsidised them in terms of workload or time off.
10651,I know of at least 2 migrant workers who were only in their 30s but had a stroke caused by COVID-19 and spent months warded in TTSH.
10652,I know of one who climbed into his maid's room to plant a broken DVD player as evidence to get her deported.
10653,I know of relatives (plural and non-Chinese btw) who treat domestic helper like shit.
10654,"One even changes domestic helpers every few months, because she treats them like literal slaves (e.g."
10655,throws trash on the floor so that maid can pick it up).
10656,"Another doesn't even allow domestic worker to serve the tea, only to prepare them and shoo her back to her room."
10657,"Also, for a more general, yet degrading view of domestic workers amongst the Malay community, see the amount of rumours about DWs making ""nasi kangkang""."
10658,The remnants of this racist policy still remain in various forms today.
10659,I know of someone who got labelled as a racist by quite a senior-ranking government official for simply pointing out that there are less Malays in universities than the national average (there was a study in 2010 that showed that only 6.8% of Malays graduated from universities compared to the national average of 28.3%).
10660,Which has led me to think whether a factual comparison between races is truly considered racist or just something that the government prefers not to talk about.
10661,"Too expensive, no future, racist comments because people think they are Indian (But we are actually Eurasians!!!"
10662,"When I mentioned about how the locals CAN be racist, higher taxes, higher bills, they're response was ""I'd rather be a thirds class citizen there than an okay citizen here""."
10663,I know some of us have seen lot of racism based incidents.
10664,Some people may be brushing this away because a small percentage may not be racism to them.
10665,"However,in this case,this is pure racism at its peak."
10666,"](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/a1d71a/a_message_to_parents_with_schoolchildren_from_a/)  Then we also have all the other stories, from people treating service staff as second-class humans, to employees abusing their domestic helpers in their own homes."
10667,I know someone who has 5 maids in 1 household but they are a multi-generation family
10668,"I know someone working in the maid agency industry, and sadly this practice is quite widespread."
10669,"Agencies do try to enforce and clamp down but it’s difficult because maids either don’t know their rights or are too afraid to speak up, and employers take advantage of this knowing full well it’s illegal."
10670,That is not what the layperson is concerned with when it comes to the implications from CECA.
10671,I know that companies pay a foreign worker levy each month ranging from $300 to $900 depending on the skill of the worker.
10672,"Let's just say there are 20,000 male migrant workers (this is a huge understatement)."
10673,"Yes xenophobic sentiment rears it's ugly head and we should not encourage it but there's not smoke without fire as well, there are underlying reasons for it"
10674,"I know the US is totally fucked, my point is just the other guy seemed to be questioning whether racists would also be the militia gun nut types."
10675,"I know this is a nice, aspirational statement but let's be real - there's as much racism here as there is anywhere else in the world."
10676,Seems like recently people will associate racism with every single fuck thing.
10677,But I can easily understand how people can skew this into me being racist/insecure too (which I was super insecure).
10678,I just wanted to point it out because of racism.
10679,"I know what you mean, but ""Expats"" is not really a term used by Westerners to refer to their foreign workers."
10680,Foreigners also include domestic helpers and construction workers.
10681,Something is driving those xenophobic sentiments.
10682,"I know, as a person that enjoys the privilege of being a male and Chinese, I would admit that it is very difficult to see sexism or racism in my life."
10683,Most people argue that the *experience* of racism as a minority and someone from the majority is very different.
10684,Nobody is saying that minorities can't be racist.
10685,"I know, that's why I said not criticism since I can't think of anything else they can do differently     I think for now, I see news of the migrant workers being moved to expo, cruise ship and hdb parking lots, but I doubt they have large capacity, and the majority still live very packed ones in their narrow small dorm."
10686,"At this rate, in a month we would have 50k cases, 95% of which are migrant workers."
10687,"I know, the guy was giving an example of how being racist would land you in trouble."
10688,"Of course racism is an entirely different issue, it will never be acceptable."
10689,"A trained caregiver is out of most people's budgets - but at the very least, people should have more awareness that maids may feel resentful that they are given such (unwanted) responsibility, and they will inevitably take it out on the patients."
10690,"I largely agree with you, there has been too much casual and covert racism, and a slew of other types bigotry, for too long in Singapore, and most seemed too content to let the status quo continue."
10691,"One thing I do want to mention though, is that having overt, public displays of racism risks normalising bigoted behaviour and  risks inciting other racists to act on their hitherto closeted racism."
10692,I laughed so hard when I read racism isn't prevalent in Singapore and when compared to other countries.
10693,"I'm from a minority race in Singapore and after living in Australia for roughly 5 years and now in the UK for almost 2, there is way less racism in those two countries as compared to Singapore."
10694,"In fact, I can easily say that Singapore still has a long way to go on racism compared to a number of first world countries."
10695,"Their country, their choice on how they want to treat expats/a specific race etc."
10696,"Working for the SG government as a contractor has taught me the definition of CYA, racism, and destroyed the very idea of collaboration."
10697,If I’d not known differently I’d say this place is filled with xenophobic cunts.
10698,"I like how if the queue number is pushed back, it's cause of racism."
10699,Aren’t live in domestic helpers residents?
10700,I like how you guys are trying so hard to justify that you all are not racist
10701,"I have been lending my support to another organization for transient workers too, called H.O.M.E., and I usually choose to support them financially over other common charities as migrant worker charities are not covered by government assistance like community chest."
10702,Sure there are ppl who want to be racist and want Singapore to be mono-cultural.
10703,"Keeping 377A to pander to a minority of population, is akin to scrapping sedition laws so that a small minority of racist can have free pass to make their ideas public legally"
10704,Just dont get desensitized to these not so small gestures of racism because these things are gateways.
10705,I had to listen while an expat ranted at me about how shitty gahmen has handled the situation.
10706,"I don't want to date X because I think our lifestyles are too different = preference  I don't want to date X because he is of a Y race and that is gross = racist     But this issue... Holding everything except race constant, ""No Indians"" is not a ""preference"" It is discrimination."
10707,"It doesn't mean that these parents are racist, that they teach their children to be racist, or that their children are racist."
10708,I like to think prejudice and racism should be differentiated.
10709,"The big issue, is with the immigrants also entering the working class labour force in Singapore."
10710,Jobs which Singaporeans are willing to and are qualified enough to do have a high amount of competition from foreign workers who can offer up a lower salary with less liabilities.
10711,I hope this doesn't come off as xenophobic.
10712,I do not have to openly exclude anyone with my racist thoughts and preferences.
10713,"if a landlord is racist and has racist preferences, they do so by openly excluding and barring any individual who has that race who tries to apply or even worse openly say to everyone “I don’t accept this race so don’t even try”."
10714,I literally just spent the last hour trying to explain to my mum why “most malays are lazy” is a racist statement.
10715,Some may attribute it to the “older generation” but I think racism and (most particularly) xenophobia is pretty common in the younger generation as well.
10716,Do any of you have any anecdotes on how you’ve rebuffed the racist/xenophobic comments from people around you?
10717,"I was there yesterday and all the FDW are doing is wearing mask, and some don't even wear properly???"
10718,"In France, racism is **illegal**."
10719,You can be fined or arrested for racism.
10720,"Yet racism happens everywhere and all the time, everywhere, casually, institutionally, overtly and covertly."
10721,There are stories of American expats being threatened by Afghan refugees and even physically hurt by them.
10722,"Edit: forgot to mention the number of people who abuse the 'racism' card and waste court resources, people's time and sometimes even win cases."
10723,It’s full of french expats who see it as no seedier than Paris and significantly safer.
10724,I experienced a lot of racism in Singapore and I'm glad to have left most of it behind.
10725,"I lived in Singapore for 3 years, and I loved the country, but I found the treatment of domestic helpers to be abhorrent."
10726,Singaporeans treat their domestic helpers like servants who are beneath them at best and at worst like slaves.
10727,From what I saw it should come as no surprise that domestic helpers would choose to work for non-Singaporeans.
10728,"Didn't really get any racism, though it's definitely present."
10729,I lived there as an expat for 10 years then returned to Australia.
10730,"On the other hand, the profiles saying this ""really is not racist"" appear to be Chinese."
10731,The landlords clearly were deflecting from admitting they were racist towards her indian bf and just said the Caucasian and Japanese preference because those aren’t their races.
10732,They justified their racism by saying shit like “we just don’t like their food smells ruining the place” or “we know mainland Chinese are really dirty”   It’s ridiculous how racist Singaporeans can be and still not admit it
10733,But not racist.
10734,That's racist in itself.
10735,Doesnt mean I dont agree with you her means I'm racist and I cannot understand.
10736,"Please stop playing it as race, racism."
10737,"I love my foreign worker friends, since i worked as a safety supervisor once, much friendly than locals when u treat them well."
10738,"I love my maid, and hope you all do too"
10739,"The comments I love the most are the ones that argue that hiring a maid is essentially lifting them out of the slums and providing them an environment where they live as free, happy individuals."
10740,Here's what a FDW goes through: they are born in abject poverty.
10741,The lucky ones find a job as your helper/nanny/maid.
10742,Your maid will frequently have a hard time sleeping at night because she misses someone deeply.
10743,"Now to those who argue that being a FDW here is so much better than being back home, I wonder if you possess the fortitude to do what these people do."
10744,"I love this take, but unfortunately with how PSP is using CECA as a strawman or entirely missing the problem by focusing on the symptom, the govt is debating them solely on CECA which unfortunately missed the point."
10745,It's just a real fucking downer when I read racist comments online and hear stupid things from folks my age.
10746,"As I said before, it's not just the racism."
10747,It's important not to mistake this for racism - there is almost never any malice involved.
10748,">And in the case of casual racism, in the end people who do this are still treating an entire race like a joke."
10749,"It is not an impossibility, since  the past decade or so showed exactly how the market would behave when there is a free choice between Singapore and foreign workers."
10750,is acceptable but CECA is not?
10751,"You seriously think the SAP schools are capable of attracting non Chinese, just by offering more mother tongue options, without completely destroying their identity and alienating the alumni?"
10752,"I may not be as well-read as you, but as a Chinese I feel that racism, or at least social injustice definitely occurs in some way."
10753,Even Malays probably have their own racist views towards other races as well.
10754,Actually implementing some standards of decency for migrant workers.
10755,"I mean during secondary school we all have to learn mother tongue indian malay chinese or whatever it is, and if we are force to learn them, it must have been essential somewhere."
10756,"But yes, I wouldn’t expect an expat Asst Mgr or Manager level to stay at Nassim Road."
10757,I mean ideally is a professionally trained nurse but many can't afford that so a untrained maid will have to do.
10758,"I mean if I received such a call, and said no to wearing tudong in hospitals police and military, then get labelled for being a racist, or say that racism is an issue or be labelled as saying race is an issue."
10759,"I see brown and I think stupid and therefore nope, that’s racist."
10760,"I mean it's predicated on the term white privilege being racist and also somehow analogous to chinese privilege, both of which are incorrect and writing an op-ed based on this misunderstanding when recent racist events have not been about any of these races is really just obfuscating the discourse"
10761,"Sembawang camp bunks are arguably worse than Tekong's lol... you could also argue that foreign workers have a choice to come, while NS is more or less forced on us."
10762,"Anyway I feel like foreign worker living conditions should be pegged to NS ones,  in terms of cleanliness and space per person."
10763,"Think the maid might be the best option, but we'll see."
10764,"I mean one issue about being an expat or foreign worker is you get to work overseas but as long as you are not a citizen or a PR, you lose out on that stability and security when shit goes down hill."
10765,The current situation sucks but any country will first protect it's citizens before talking about expats/FW
10766,I mean racist means “you hate a certain race” racially insensitive just means that “ you don’t give a shit about any race”
10767,"It's not necessarily wrong if you want to say that X culture or faculty is more likely to have racists, if you can provide some statistical or anecdotal evidence of why that might be so."
10768,I mean that is the definition discrimination or racism.
10769,People don't like to be identified as racist and they will usually find a reason.
10770,"Let me give you a list of things that ARE racist and no logic can explain it away:  \- If you hire 2 people who are equally competent, but you pick the chinese over the malay because no reason."
10771,That's racist  \- If you think malays are lazy.
10772,That's racist.
10773,"Because laziness is not inherent to a race of ethnic group  \- If you treat someone poorly because of their race  What is not racist:  \- Hiring a Chinese worker because you need to talk to chinese clients  \- Saying things like Germans are better at X because it is TRUE that abilities or skillsets in a trade CAN be region, country or ethnic specific."
10774,I mean the Chinese are notoriously racist  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Few8kJ0zfnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Few8kJ0zfnY)
10775,"Of course there are legal occlusions, just like citizens and PRs also have legal occlusions to ""free movement""    ===  I tried googling to see where else the word unconditional turned up regarding CECA, and the earliest mention I see is 2019 from CCS, where he said that CECA doesn't give unconditional jobs to Indians  [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/no-unconditional-jobs-under-ceca-says-singapores-minister/articleshow/71990159.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/no-unconditional-jobs-under-ceca-says-singapores-minister/articleshow/71990159.cms?from=mdr)  They should argue base upon the word free movement not a word they raise themselves to paint a strawman."
10776,I mean there's legitimately a lot of racism against black people tho.
10777,But it doesn't mean literally everything that happens to them is due to racism... Foreigners don't understand how race and ethnicity is conceptualised in Asia and they start slinging accusations everywhere
10778,"Tbh, if the staff is so racist just to wait and sell the last waffle to a Chinese person and delay the store closing, the person is just purely insane and ask for this to blown"
10779,"Also, racism here has become more and more in-your-face recently i.e."
10780,"I mean within the context of singapore, us chinese people are the ones who dont ""get"" racism"
10781,I mean yo dude I accompanied my maid for 10 years to the market and helped her cook for a good 6-7.
10782,"I mean you can treat foreigners as shitty as you want (we have seen the dorm situation, we have seen how maids are treated, and now we see the hate on this topic)."
10783,The minority shouts racism and the non-minority can't ask why is that racist.
10784,Minority doesn't even have to **logically explain why and how** it's racist - just because!
10785,Great dialogue and step towards helping everyone understand what is racist and what to not do.
10786,"It would be great if someone who wants to educate non-minority on racism and if someone has a logical explanation, **I would love to be educated**."
10787,Instead of being called a racist when people can't even explain how or why.
10788,**How are the non-minority supposed to learn then if we're told to just accept we are racist??
10789,"It's one thing to be racist, it's another thing to close your eyes to the truth."
10790,It's surprising how much cognitive dissonance racists can live with.
10791,"You're a skilled and hardworking immigrant!"""
10792,"I mean, it's 7D for Korea, Germany, Canada, ANZ and Brunei, and I do anticipate we will have a VTL with Korea in a month or two."
10793,"But if we want to maintain a standard of living higher than the region, we're going to have to have a much larger proportion of foreign workers than other countries do."
10794,"I mean, its okay to pander to racists on that subject but not on others?"
10795,"Also, I said only that my grandma was screaming at the maid, and that they didn't want to give her WiFi access (Yes, I slipped her the password anyway)."
10796,"Nobody's saying all of Singapore or the whole government is hyper racist or anything like that (except maybe 2-3 dumb posters, but jeez, this is reddit, how are you not used to that by now)."
10797,"In those cases, they bring their families with them because of either expatriate packages, or because the cost of living in where they are from is not too far off from the cost of living in Singapore."
10798,"I know I'd be advised to just downvote and move on, but there is a danger to just letting xenophobic comments and opinions fester and grow unchecked."
10799,"I mean, we're already experiencing what happens if we force resources into citizens and letting our migrant workers miss out — the Covid outbreak."
10800,"I mean, we’re definitely not the _only_ country with a xenophobia problem…or did we already forget everything from 2015 to 2020?"
10801,"They not only have the same systemic hidden racism present in every country, but the open, violent ones as well that is pretty endemic to a few select countries like the US."
10802,"Literally an ethnic minority, immigrant worker, right?"
10803,"It might, *might* make some people go   "" eh cb u expat expat think you atas ang moh issit ? """
10804,"I mean...a country where landlords ask for your race before renting and immigration wants you to check the box to specify if you are ""Chinese, Indian, Malay or Other"" really needs an episode to uncover the underlying racism?"
10805,I meant policies for attracting foreign talent in general.
10806,"I meant that it is outright racism, my bad."
10807,I meant the VTL to India.
10808,I know there are other airlines under VTL dude.
10809,"Note that I didn't call you racist, but ignorant."
10810,I meant to say those people can be racist even to an Indian family printed on a banner.
10811,I met many foreign workers who integrated well so I don’t understand why you immediately assume there’s a gap.
10812,"I might be an outlier, growing up in the 80s-90s with both parents working odd hours, hiring a maid was expensive but necessary."
10813,"Then in the 90s, only mum is around so having a maid then is the upmost importance."
10814,"In that era when news of kids being kidnapped were common, my mum would make sure the maid would fetch my sibling to and from school."
10815,The maid was essentially our nanny.
10816,As an adult I found out my mum actually borrowed money from family & friends to pay the maid.
10817,"I might be digressing a bit, but the argument that the majority race of a country cannot experience racism stems from the idea that it is only racism when it is entrenched in power (i.e."
10818,Structural racism) right?
10819,I miss not judging expats
10820,For example people are still harping on and on about intra company transfers under CECA even after government revealed that only 500 people a year max are coming in under this provision.
10821,Hope racism goes away tho that’s unlikely.
10822,Not sure about the part on the wife making the police report: Perhaps the maid has normative contact with the wife instead of the husband.
10823,For expats I'm thinking of white Anglo expats mostly.
10824,That we say no to all foreign workers?
10825,Or we say no to all foreign workers who are Muslim?
10826,"People here knew him for quite a long time given his migrant worker advocacy, so it makes us feel sceptical that you proposed that he was an otherwise bad character."
10827,I never got how people can mistreat their domestic workers willingly.
10828,"There are shitty maids out there, but there seems to be way too many shitty mistreatment stories as well..."
10829,How is it racist to speak a different language?
10830,And decided that this expat right here isn't classy enough for that stuff.
10831,"So, I've been thinking since most people can communicate with English pretty well nowadays and not really in mother tongues not their own especially the younger generation there really is no point in teaching mother tongues anymore not to the extent we are anyways."
10832,Broken English I feel is a real problem as not only is there no real application for half English half Chinese/insert mother tongue it also diminishes our competency in both languages as we can just replace words we don't know in another language rather than learning it leaving people with half empty vocabulary in possibly both languages.
10833,I like the part he mentioned about foreign worker which he put it in a nice way and is very astute.
10834,> Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms?
10835,You want to discriminate against these foreign workers?
10836,I never realised how visible pinoys and prc can get.. so that tellsu how racist I am
10837,All I said is that we are not so far removed from being immigrants from there.
10838,"Intelligent because there is proper discourse here without the mysgoyny, xenophobia, racism etc that is so prevalent in FB comments (eg this post we are commenting on)."
10839,"I am saying that the VTL policy is not consistent with its intended goals, and that the VTL policies by the SG government is creating windfall gains for SIA while not achieving the goal of significantly reducing risk to the nation."
10840,"I never said it's only maids, it's just more difficult for them."
10841,What about maids?
10842,"In fact, if you actually read my admittedly long essay, you'd see that even I've experienced racism."
10843,I never said anything about the government not being racist.
10844,"LKY has shown racist tendencies, and that's a well known fact."
10845,The issue I had was with the author saying that Singapore as a whole is a racist country.
10846,"Yes there are racist people, there always will be, but we cannot let them define Singapore."
10847,She also mentioned that America is less racist.
10848,You only need to look at the coverage on the Boston Bomber to know just how racist America is.
10849,"If you've noticed, my entire argument does not pick out any race and I already mentioned at the start of this damn thread that its not racism."
10850,Even the xenophobia in singapore is not unjustified given the current situation.
10851,"We are seeing this in the dominance of expats and some token privileged cosmopolitan local elites at the top, and armies of exploited migrant workers at the bottom."
10852,I notice a pattern when discussing FDW's.
10853,"The mental gymnastics to justify this are  ""I pay rental/clothing/food for her""  ""Gahmen make me pay maid levy."
10854,This is the demographic who think they deserve to have a maid perform butler like service not taking into account that a butler can make 50K on average while the top butlers earn 6 figures.
10855,I notice many malaysian chinese can be quite racist towards the non-chinese.
10856,They are borderline outwardly racist.
10857,I noticed my domestic helper does that too.
10858,"Although I also noticed in my previous (expat) job, people are more likely to stay after work for drinks while for my current mostly-Singaporean job, there is little socializing after work."
10859,I noticed western media tend to encourage racism against Asians in their reporting.
10860,I can find Griezmann Blackface news in BBC news but not on Griezmann Japan racist video.
10861,"I often think apart from racism, there is also colorism involved."
10862,I once asked a Malay buddy if it's considered racist that a Malay make a racist Malay joke.
10863,His response: It's only racist if it's not funny.
10864,But the mother gave the domestic helper only one drumstick to go with her plate of rice.
10865,I once tried to open a bank account for a friend who worked as a maid.
10866,"If you have an issue with property damages, then deal with it objectively with the particular renter, rather than assuming that future Indian renters will do the same thing, because that is the exact definition of being discriminatory and racist."
10867,I only brought up that point because OP was talking about FDW not getting paid enough.
10868,"Your point on if Singaporeans don't hire FDW still being able to survive in their own countries or others, it could be true but I disagree."
10869,Nobody (hopefully) put a gun to their head and forced them to come to Singapore to work as a FDW but they still came.
10870,I only hope that our racist attitude dies with us...
10871,"But until something more systematic is done, these Lawyers are truly a godsend for these migrant workers."
10872,Not sure if that solution would be more or less racist.
10873,I personally don't feel that you are being xenophobic.
10874,I personally feel that COVID-19 hits migrant workers community hard.
10875,"If I were to complain about how tough it is not to go out or meet friends during CB at the comfort of my home, truly cannot imagine how the migrant workers feel."
10876,I personally feel that a majority of Singaporeans got their emotions mixed up between what is racism and what is nationalism.
10877,"I know people who are compelled to believe that they are doing our country a duty by promoting racism against ""outsiders"", and I guess it could end up being a 'flock mentality' where it takes only one vocal person to start a wave of agreement on the internet."
10878,"And it is easy to start the wave of racist comments, because it is more easy to word a sweeping complaint that appeals to our emotional shortcuts than a rational argument that requires actual thinking and questioning of our nation's system, plans and sustainability."
10879,"I agree that racism needs an easy target, but what made filipinos (or PRCs, etc etc) the easy target?"
10880,If only there is an easy way to tell that to the racists.
10881,"But if my pool of friends and family suggest anything, is that most are not racist."
10882,It’s equivalent to being racist to strangers / making racist jokes at strangers.
10883,I personally have been guilty of not standing up and saying something when my friends made racist remarks and jokes to others.
10884,"I personally think it's racism, but using ""racially insensitive"" makes people a lot more receptive to the point in making"
10885,"This exclusion applies to all foreigners, not just the stereotypical expat that lives in River Valley but also the domestic helpers and the Malaysians that cook the cai png at your neighbourhood kopitiam."
10886,"I personally try myself to inform those who are deciding to become foreign worker, but I'm just one person."
10887,This has nothing to do with xenophobia but the tight foreign workers quota that the government have set.
10888,"We have witnessed a meteoric explosion of covid cases in foreign worker dormitories, with absolutely no consequences, and even an infuriating ""but no worker himself has demanded an apology"" statement from the individual who is most responsible for it."
10889,"If even privileged Chinese-majority residents think that there is a special set of laws for wealthy expats and another for citizens, the system has really failed the test of public perception."
10890,"When the mere idea of a reserved presidency is ridiculed in headlines across major publications, and the shamed MP who mooted it forced to publicly apologize for its racist undertones."
10891,"I consider English my mother tongue - the language I feel most comfortable expressing myself in & more importantly, it's the language I think in."
10892,"I posted this in another thread, but here's my reply:   We had a domestic helper for 23 years."
10893,[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7txz49/is_anyone_else_bothered_by_how_maids_are_treated/dtg6th3/?context=3)
10894,"Remember now there were people defending the dormitory owners are barely breaking even, then it turned out that they were actually making supernormal levels of profit while treating the workers like dirt."
10895,"Have friends and family in 40s,50s and 60s who simply cannot function without the help of their domestic helpers and have zero regrets/qualms/doubts."
10896,I propose that new citizens and PRs pass a Malay language test instead.
10897,"Given the migrant worker situation IS the predominant covid problem in Singapore now, do you not agree its fair to ""force resources into this area?"""
10898,Basically I believe that there is going to be a mass exodus of foreigners from Singapore by the end of the year if the travel restrictions aren't lifted so people can go home for Xmas.
10899,"This country has a huge foreign population and almost every ""expat"" I know is thinking about leaving, especially if things don't improve."
10900,I read a VTL from Paris via Amsterdam got slapped with 7 day SHN - I think that’s a likely end to any Euro travel
10901,"I went to an international school when I was younger with lots of Chinese students, they were pretty racist towards me in the sense they thought I was retarded because I was darker skinned (a few of the Chinese students were really good friends with me though and taught me stuff about their culture)."
10902,How bad is the racism towards Indians in Singapore compare to the UK?
10903,The only racist people in the UK are the chavs and pretty much no one likes them.
10904,"I acknowledge that it appears the female employer's behaviour may have been problematic to the maid, though there's still nothing said on the circumstances of her parenting."
10905,I read the articles but I'm still confused by what exactly CECA provides in terms of labor.
10906,I know CECA allows for easier intra company transfers which I can't disagree with but does it specify anything else with respect to labor?
10907,Add for those who missed it that poster was justifying treating maids poorly and taking away their phones due to them not focusing on their work.
10908,That’s precisely the sort of comment almost word for word I heard from a former friend’s family who hired a maid.
10909,If she wanted to point out that we should treat migrant workers better then just say so.
10910,What was even the bunch of stuff about SG not being better and people don't come here willingly - it's irrelevant to the request to treat migrant workers better.
10911,All this  scaremongering and racist shit about turning away from Malays is fucking abhorrent and likely spread by a kid with too much time on his hands.
10912,"How do you think your ethnicity (or spoken mother tongue, culture, accent, etc.)"
10913,Seems to me that the editorial is drawing a tenuous connection of the rise in racism to foreign ideas (of which CRT is one) and social media.
10914,But it’s not as if minorities have never experienced racism in Singapore before prior to the predominance of social media and CRT becoming known to activists as a way to understand the power dynamics existing between different groups predicated along racial lines.
10915,I realised that the reason for his assholery was racism only after the kids had left and he shared his thoughts with me.
10916,"I really all for stricter guidelines and improvement in conditions for migrant workers, but I’m sure those who manage the dorms will find loopholes to exploit to preserve the space to house more people in cramped spaces."
10917,"As an expat, that book has pride of place on my bookshelf (honestly, next to all the non-fiction books I've never read) - it's very difficult to see the value of it from within Singapore, but the moment you leave and you assimilate to a fully Westernized system instead of the half-British half-Chinese system and thinking (and technically, people) in Singapore, it becomes a true wonder."
10918,"I understand the density of the dorms makes it harder to control spread and that's a different issue to be addressed, but migrant workers are also tested a lot more than the general community so clusters should be manageable."
10919,I really don't get why these people keep mistreating their maids.
10920,Can't imagine someone complaining about not being called it... (The racists are obviously worse but this one stood out in stupidity)
10921,I really don't think it's fair for you to make the claim that it's a FACT that many Singaporean Chinese are racist.
10922,"I really don't think that people concerned about growing xenophobia in Singapore are concerned after seeing ""rational anxieties Singaporeans may have about immigration""."
10923,"It's the rise in blatant xenophobia, especially from online sites, that is really troubling."
10924,But I agree with you that the root of the problem isn't xenophobia.
10925,Even if all the immigrants magically disappeared overnight the income gap would still continue to widen due to the social policies in place and the anger would just be directed somewhere else.
10926,"> As migrant workers work hard for Singapore’s benefit, it’s only fitting that we show them a little appreciation  with a $3 McD meal for their 2 years of being locked up in a cage like battery chicken, living in 12 person rooms, with no COVID safe management, and worms in their food?"
10927,"Honestly, might as well just spit in the McChicken you handed those migrant workers."
10928,I really doubt OP is a labour worker and definitely wouldn't face the same day to day issues as migrant workers from Bangladesh.
10929,"But OP is spot on, next time you see any migrant workers from anywhere, just remember they are people too."
10930,"How many of those people queuing outside HDL even know who the owner is, and whether he's Singaporean or immigrant?"
10931,"I really enjoyed the article, it was a lot more nuanced than I thought an article on racism would be."
10932,"In general, racism around the world has morphed from the outright hostility and discrimination to a more subtle kind."
10933,"Jokes based on ignorance have more of an effect than jokes based on hostility, simply because there are so many more ignorant people than extreme racists."
10934,Getting approval from a Malay friend to tell racist jokes is probably not how he truly feels.
10935,Lawyers have a code of conduct that prohibits following instructions from clients if the instructions are racist.
10936,I really hope the migrant workers get treated the same as our locals.
10937,I really hope there will be a VTL with Indonesia soon
10938,"But I also find it eerily absurd to pay someone low salary to kinda enslave them ..and you mentioned all the points I wanted to express very nicely   After 200 years when we all have robo servants , there will be articles ,historical books and trivia talking about ‘how people used cheap labor as maid ans servants in 2000s era’"
10939,"The Singaporean only shops, for whatever reason, just stand out to show the racism involved in clearance and nothing about foreigners or gender."
10940,"I really just hope that helpers or maids or whatever people call them, they all receive better treatment than the harsh ones we hear on the internet/in the news every now and then."
10941,A lot of the time you find that your close friends and family are the very racists and xenophobes you despise.
10942,"I really like how our society evolves from racism to ""racism""."
10943,"The fact that she received backlash for mocking the majority of the Singapore population is indeed self deserving, but certainly I don't think it labels her as racist."
10944,I really think it's fine to joke when you're not a racist.
10945,"What i mean is that, I feel like the occasional banter between friends that have mild racism isn't bad and it's all in good fun."
10946,Slapping on the labels of racist/xenophobic/liberal/conservative/sexist/*insert relevant word*-phobic is so incredibly lazy and unhelpful in a proper conversation on any topic.
10947,I really won't attribute it to racism tbh.
10948,What they fail to understand is that these cases are coming from foreign workers rather than due to Indians on EP/DP/LTVP etc or due to people going back to India and then returning.
10949,I really wonder what went through this Mf’s mind beating up someone while being racist.
10950,"I recall LHL referred to these migrant workers as ""brothers"" in one of his televised speeches."
10951,"This was a response to the G's unequivocal position that Singapore could not and would not be taking in the refugees, and this position was criticised as xenophobic and racist by some of my acquaintances - the same ones who presently hold the view that the English who voted Leave are racist, uneducated, conservative, xenophobic and backward."
10952,"I recall hearing about the case in 2016, where the mother and daughter duo were arrested on suspicion of killing their domestic helper Piang Ngaih Don from Myanmar.. but then I haven't heard any updates lately."
10953,Relevant news article: http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/mother-and-daughter-charged-with-maids-murder-remanded-for-another-week
10954,It’s very important for new immigrants to adopt local norms as a group.
10955,"I received a job offer from a Japanese one year ago, and waited one year before the borders finally re-opened for the 370,000 stranded foreign workers / students like myself."
10956,"Given how cautious the Japanese government is, I doubt the VTL for tourists will be opened so soon (spring for tourists would be very good already)."
10957,I recently came back to SG from Korea - under the VTL - on a holiday trip.
10958,"*  First, a useful link regarding VTL: [https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m\_2435/view.do?seq=761362](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m_2435/view.do?seq=761362)  ***Pre-Departure:***  For Pre-Departure, there were a number of documents that we needed to prepare in order to be able to fly under the VTL."
10959,I will also mention that the [site](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m_2435/view.do?seq=761362) (Q&A on VTL) states that only travelers that live together in Singapore can quarantine in the same accommodation.
10960,"I kinda understand the peak in Sept/Oct because of relaxed border measures, but what is going on now?"
10961,"I reckon VTLs are used mostly by citizens/residents to leave the country for holiday/visit relatives, and to a much lesser extent by foreigners coming here on holiday 😁"
10962,"I refer to the article, ""Man who called lift passenger 'smelly' in racist remarks gets jail, fine"" by u/sgtaguy  As a multi-racial society, it is important for Singapore to uphold our strive towards maintaining racial harmony."
10963,That is why I believe we must not let too many caucasian foreign talents into our country because it may serve as a catalyst to destabilize the nation that my generation fought so hard to preserve.
10964,"not withstanding point C  is point B a valid red flag, I felt from the response from the recruiter, its like I'm a fdw under a maid agency."
10965,Am a local Indian as well and casual racism was very rampant during my primary and secondary school days.
10966,I've been made fun of because of my race in almost all of my classes except for my mother tongue classes.
10967,People like to attribute racism to the older generation but but mind you I'm a Gen Z and these things happened like just a decade ago.
10968,These kids were probably negatively influenced by their boomer parents who're probably just as racist.
10969,"Call it what you want, but the racism by the cops was blatant."
10970,I remember CharAznia boasting that he is a SME owner who can only find 'foreign talents'.
10971,I remember a discussion a tutorial session over a decade years ago in NUS on the treatment of foreign workers and the TA had a difficulty finding the right word to describe the treatment to conclude the discussion.
10972,I think some of that is warranted (for China market work) but a lot of that seems a bit... racist?
10973,"I remember making a comment on the thread with the Aussie racists, stating that some of the blanket statement comments that were no better than the actual racists themselves."
10974,And i had someone reply that it is justified because we are not the ones being racist towards Aussies.
10975,I remember my former boss had similar issues with his maids also.
10976,Changed 14 maids within 10 years.
10977,This is a woman who spent two decades working in the middle east as a foreign worker and is the child of a migrant father and SC mother.
10978,(perhaps this one)[https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/maid-jailed-falsely-accusing-man-70-rape]  It's not about false rape accusations.
10979,I remember someone here said it’s not racism if it happens to someone majority.
10980,I remember when a taxi driver told me I look like a 'Filipino maid' as compared to the rest of my chinese family just because I was wearing home clothes and was tanned.
10981,So 100% agree with you that racism especially toward South Asians and Filipinos is normalised here.
10982,">The Workers’ Party, the strongest of Singapore’s small opposition parties, said in its manifesto it would price new government-built HDB apartments at a level such that buyers would take 20 years to pay off their mortgage instead of 30.  https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-singapore-election-factbox/factbox-main-issues-in-singapores-2011-general-election-idUKTRE74513L20110506  ... And I don't see the foreign migrant worker issue in Serangoon."
10983,I rescheduled my flight to a VTL one 2 days ago.
10984,SIA website has not updated their VTL page so I’m just hoping they can refund the extra cost or allow me to reschedule to a non VTL one.
10985,I resent your suggestion that being a maid is degrading or a 'lesser' job.
10986,"As an Indian-Singaporean, there's a reason I laugh when people warned me about American racism when I moved to the US - in the US, I've worked in major cities, and experienced far less racism here than in Singapore."
10987,I run a software company in Thailand and expats always cost more.
10988,Most immigration policy says if you aren’t paying expat more then local you are just trying to avoid hiring locals.
10989,"I said **current** immigration policy, not what is already in-place since 50 years ago"
10990,I said it’s racist if it’s because you have preconceived notions/stereotypical views about the person.
10991,"But if I haven’t even met him and simply declared: I don’t date black guys because they are all violent and crazy, then YES I am racist lol"
10992,I saw a family once going for a buffet and their maid was with them.
10993,All of them were eating and enjoying themselves except for the maid.
10994,The maid was taking care of their kids and feeding them but the family didn't even bother to share anything with her.
10995,"All the maids that my family hired in the past were always treated like family, we'll ask them to join us during meal times and if they felt like it they were free to cook whatever they wanted, we even bring the maids together on holidays and let them order whatever they want in restaurants."
10996,"We still have new cases everyday, but these are mostly in the foreign worker community and is because we haven't tested everyone."
10997,"Then recently, he tweeted about the current protest, expressing that he is sad because ""violence is never the answer"" even if it is against racism or whatnot."
10998,"Maybe it's a good time to look at our LOCAL social issues and evaluate our thoughts on them (for instance, racism in Singapore), especially those of us who are Chinese, the majority race where we live."
10999,I saw and read about how netizens approached the *racism* angle to the whole saga.
11000,I saw colleagues posting this online vilifying the woman with colourful xenophobic comments.
11001,"Firstly, there is nothing wrong in calling out acts in racism, in fact, I think that we should call it out when we do see such instances."
11002,"However, given the severity of racism, if you want to call out an incident as racist, you really should have as much evidence as possible to prove your point."
11003,"The issue here is there is insufficient evidence to prove that the staff indeed commited an act of racism, rather than it being a mere misunderstanding."
11004,Please do not think we are downplaying racism here.
11005,"Now, I'm ethnically Sinhalese, and I've studied Mandarin as my mother tongue for all my schooling life."
11006,But I've never once experience the kind of racism that this girl experienced.
11007,>The first time I experienced racism was in a classroom when I was nine years old.
11008,"It's not racism, its business."
11009,">So while kids hung out with other kids who spoke their mother tongue at recess, I spent my lunchtime solo with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and Enid Blyton."
11010,Nor can I believe that any of my classmates would this racist.
11011,"So yes, I do hear the racist comments thrown at me on rare occasions while I'm on the bus or the train."
11012,"These people who've thrown racist insults my way, have all been really old uncles and aunties, or foreigners."
11013,And I've heard racist comments from all the races.
11014,Pretty racist no?
11015,"Now, my friend immediately said they were being racist."
11016,"In this context, they aren't being racist."
11017,How could someone list a domestic helper like an object?
11018,"I say ""maid"" because I'm tired of the euphemism treadmill."
11019,But these companies took the risk of squeezing foreign workers tightly so that they could make a bigger profit.
11020,"But now that things are going bad, taxpayers have to foot the bill to move the foreign workers to hostels, HDB flats and floating hotels and pay for their treatment and testing etc."
11021,I’m the child of expats and my mum joined some charities she liked and also the British Association and did some of their planned activities and that’s how she made most of her friends!!
11022,"A pre warning tho, expat friends tend to leave after a year or two, especially as you get older and your friends seem to come and go so if you don’t wish to make friends w someone to then have them leave, you can try to make friends with the locals!"
11023,"What's the qualifying criteria for ""local contract"" vs ""expat package"" for foreigners?"
11024,"This is a \*huge\* deal-breaker to many expats  I worked in R&D, almost everyone I hire has PhDs and pay is not an issue."
11025,4/5 of my married expat staff decided to leave then and there.
11026,I honestly can't think of a good reason for this policy other than pure xenophobia.
11027,I have a maid (or many past maids) which is hired to help my mom take care of the house chores so she could take care of 2 kids (not mine).
11028,"The first maid who is Indonesian, work the longest of 3 years."
11029,"From our experiences, we find that a lot of maids take advantage when they can."
11030,"Reason why she went embassy instead of complaining to agency was because she wanted to go back, she doesn't want to be a maid/helper and that she still have to pay the agency."
11031,"My mom often buy take-aways for the 2 kids, herself and the maid."
11032,"End of the day, my point in sharing is there, from our experience, there's a lot of helpers/maids who gives funny funny ""patterns"" which aren't talked about commonly when maid abuse cases/news was discussed."
11033,I see all the maid abuse cases and I hope they done by a small group of assholes who reside here in Singapore.
11034,"All the maids I’ve encountered (be it in my family or friends), have been treated really well."
11035,"As an expat, you have expectations."
11036,I was an expat once to a third world country.
11037,My wife was an expat here in Singapore.
11038,Some migrant workers love the food and give a thumbs up.
11039,"I see expats come heartlands, I somehow feel happy."
11040,Next door neighbor is an expat.
11041,Hibye here and there so we dont really talk casually but we first got speaking because i am an expat as well.
11042,"The widely used term is 'foreign talent', which does not preclude recognizing 'local talents'."
11043,I see that you are going around accusing people of xenophobia groundlessly.
11044,"There is existing xenophobia in Singapore, due to long term issues built up by things like the white paper, jobs, 10m population etc."
11045,Introducing English as a common medium between foreigners and locals can help reduce xenophobia and allow foreigners to fit it better while still retaining their cultural identity.
11046,"LKY is either racist or not, that's a question of fact."
11047,"He can be racist while also being a ""straight talker"", or a person that DESTROYES THE SJWs, but the factual issue of whether he is racist, does not depend on these other issues."
11048,I am making the point that LKY has had a long history of racist comments on Malays.
11049,"I see the issue you’ve faced, like anyone else being a minority, it’s a classic example of racism being internalised through such generalisations but that doesn’t allow you a free pass to take an ugly swipe at another underprivileged group and blame the existing structural flaws in society."
11050,"If you are addressing racism you need to also confront and challenge the systemic obstacles in opportunities for advancement and better recognition, not joining the mockery bandwagon of apathy."
11051,I see the logic but not sure how it is xenophobic.
11052,I know we've lots of expats and I was for that matter for a decade.
11053,"I see the trend here... xenophobic, racism, anti-establishment... build the wall will be trending next"
11054,I can only speak English other than my mother tongue.
11055,"If I go on a public forum or whatnot and say so, and I being racist?"
11056,You'd be amazed at the entitlement some expats here exhibit so it's better you be apprised of the realities beforehand than to be met with rude awakening.
11057,>It is implied racism.
11058,So the ads for no Indians no PRC are not xenophobic .... ?
11059,I seriously don't know why the expats get pissed off about openings for selected countries though?
11060,"We were open to Australia for a good long time and tons of Aussie expats took advantage of that for a trip home, didn't see anyone bitching about that."
11061,I served in an infantry battalion and have never seen much racism.
11062,Yup we're pretty racist ( we're sgians)
11063,"Like if you wanna be racist, hate all races equally lah."
11064,"I sincerely thought racism was illegal in your country, as in the government had very little tolerance for intolerance based on race."
11065,You need to understand that 1) quite a large proportion of China immigrants are not from the Fujian province.
11066,"2) you seem to forget to mention that for many immigrants from China, they somehow believe that all Chinese are the same no matter how long they have lived overseas and that loyalty to China is to be expected."
11067,VTL is currently suspended.
11068,"Tbh, I can't even remember if I've ever heard racism directed at me in Chinese."
11069,This was strange because I'm born and bred here and look nothing like the northern Chinese (my ancestors are from the south coast) which make up of most foreign workers.
11070,I spent an hour yesterday watching her IG Live interview after I saw that alleged quote about perpetuating racist culture.
11071,I'm a parent now with a kindy kid too and the kindy is in an expat area but no affiliation to any pri sch.
11072,Other expat parents who can't afford are alrdy looking at local schools and have applied for parent volunteer to try and secure slots.
11073,I'm not saying all expats are high earners or high flyers.
11074,I want to emphasise that this is not about race — the last thing I want to read are racist remarks.
11075,"I spit my coffee at the banquet portion, although it sounds really tough for you to have endured such blatant racism throughout your life."
11076,"---  The cost still depends on employer even in ceteris paribus condition because the foreign worker levies are tiered, so the more you hire, the more expensive it becomes, to a point where you'll be paying $800 per month if you are towards the higher tier."
11077,"Reminds me of Chinese wumaos, if you hate CCP means you hate China, means you hate Chinese means you are racist!"
11078,"I stay in an area that has quite a few expats, we do have several black families here."
11079,But I am more restrained and I do not voice out my thoughts and go full racist mode.
11080,Is it easier persuade a racist to not stereotype or persuade the rotten apples to behave considerately?
11081,"Whenever they post an article regarding Rohingyas and the situation in Myanmar, tons of Burmese people spam the comments about how they are illegals, they are Bengali/Bangladeshi, and usually tons of racist comments."
11082,"I still have a few years of study before I consider returning to SG, if you mean going back for good, by then, there probably won’t be need for VTL anymore (hopefully)."
11083,"Good thing is, these people are the first names on the chopping board anytime a cost push comes along, so overtime, this group will thin out and new expats don't get these sweet deals (although their salaries still tend to be higher)."
11084,I still respect the migrant workers that stayed and continue to work despite all the physical and mental conditions they suffered.
11085,"We are only getting this heightened alertness about racism because of these incidents, at least it's got us talking about the issue and hopefully enabling education of those who still harbour such values."
11086,"If racism and xenophobia are complex issues then why will mod team choose the sledge hammer approach of banning CECA term, while simultaneously deleting all posts and threads and not having any word of it in a front page post?"
11087,I stop talking to my landlady because she is a cunt to her maid.
11088,"Unfortunately this is an issue which wouldn’t be resolved in a day and here are some suggestions, especially for young kids but some apply to adults as well  1) it’s not about just racism in school."
11089,Else this grows into what can be called downright racism where the person starts believing their jokes and taunts.
11090,Even the larger Chinese companies have a bug expat population with a healthy mix).
11091,3) The only way to ensure such racism doesn’t effect you is in your hands.
11092,"Again, I am not saying racists are right, but just saying why shouldn’t it impact you because it is the insecurity of the accused and nothing to do with the victim."
11093,"I know that racism is bad, be it against anyone (Indians, Malay, Chinese, blacks) but again we must realise there is something wrong with the one being racist rather than us."
11094,90% of hard core racists just end up being like the Karen who end up recording videos in mrt.
11095,How bad and institutionalised is racism there that most indochinese accepted ‘Cina’ as normal.
11096,I subscribe to Avenue Q's reasoning that everybody is a little bit racist
11097,"Even then, you are already attacking that person by calling them an expat in a derogatory way, and taking offence at their clearly well intended advice to not harbour so much hatred."
11098,I dont know about the situation concerning maids though.
11099,"Besides, pointing out that you differentiate Chinese people born in different places based on looks IS racist."
11100,"But there will be those new maids, barely out of their  teens with little education and first time out of the country that would require some degree of management."
11101,The part of what I said that addresses the casual racism you write about is this:  > It is possible that most people in Singapore grew up with some racist stereotypes passed down from their parents.
11102,I think that many Singaporeans are brought up as racists without even being conscious of it and it is not something that is going to change in an instant.
11103,"But we can hope for change as the populace gets more educated - and by education, I am not just referring to schools and textbooks, but also awareness of the issue of racism and the ability to think critically about the correctness of what is told to us by our family and peers."
11104,My place has so many high skilled jobs being filled by barely qualified FT that i honestly feel a bit xenophobic sometimes.
11105,I suspect Singapore’s issue isnt racism but classism however.
11106,The rich Indians and Chinese in the country don’t seem subjected to the same racism other less well-off people do.
11107,"I have been getting tons of ""New Zealand misses you"" ads on facebook way before VTL was even a thing."
11108,I suspect it's a matter of time until the entire EU is permitted for VTL.
11109,"Now she's planning on moving out, bringing my nephew with her, dismissing her domestic helper and threatening neglect on the kid."
11110,"I think I'm assuming it's not necessary to have a maid, and you're assuming it's necessary and it's just the impact of it that's under discussion."
11111,"I hope for one day where our society will truly practise what it preaches, where CMIO takes a backseat to our shared nationality."
11112,I take this to mean that the maid is still liable for her commission to the agency less 10 days.
11113,People are focussed on blaming foreign workers for having such a high count.
11114,They are making assumptions that maids are/will be the cause of local community spread because they hang out with (putting it mildly) foreign workers.
11115,Constant bitching about how the result of this is due to the high number of foreign workers we bring in.
11116,"And when that particular generation is gone, the majority should have a better sense of what racism is."
11117,"To this day, I still see racism in hobby chat groups on WhatsApp etc."
11118,I tend not to put an overly strict definition on what is racist.
11119,"Actually come to think of it, I'm not sure where Sarah used the word ""racist"" at all."
11120,"I just went back to her IG posts and stories, and nowhere did she label PA as racist."
11121,But just talking about race tends to get the majority super defensive that they're being accused of racism or something.
11122,(ETA:- of course i could be wrong and she actually accused PA of being racist somewhere.
11123,There could be community linked cases of long term / employment pass holders that do not live in the dormitories.
11124,I think 32k migrant workers != 123k unique people
11125,It's time for Singaporeans to be considered the talent instead of 'foreign talent'.
11126,Maybe time to create a job where a third party organisation reviews maids livelihoods.
11127,"From current system it seems to be the maid agency doing own review, and you can see why they would be incentivised not to discover any issues."
11128,They are not - in the first the racist is condemning free choice of people in a private matter (who they date).
11129,I think OP is more against the concept of having maids itself than the actual rules and practices about being a maid in Singapore.
11130,"Truth is, being a maid is already a subjugating and demeaning role."
11131,"If the maid lives somewhere else and we aren’t liable for their welfare, then ofc go and live your life, we also don’t want to play the role of the disciplinarian."
11132,"A lot of people who have maids are just ordinary working people, not particularly rich."
11133,I’m sorry it sucks but that takes priority over the maid’s dating life.
11134,Otherwise the alternative would lead to a decrease in taking maids and thereby less jobs for their people.
11135,I think OP is referring to the racist uncle and not Mr Dave.
11136,I think OP is saying that the thread is talking about the experiences that minorities have felt due to racism and you are distracting from that issue with your tongue in cheek comment.
11137,I think Singaporeans should be weaned off general-purpose live-in maids who are severely underpaid.
11138,Feel like maids are paid like shit for the work they do and the conditions some of them are subjected to by bad employers.
11139,Many other families in developed countries can get by without live-in maids.
11140,"Even if he is not being racist, he can easily be seen as racist by many others."
11141,But I would say it seems more xenophobic than racist.
11142,I think VTLs are a good thing regardless of internal matters as families can finally visit each other after years.
11143,I think a bunch of the expats who left last year didn't leave voluntarily.
11144,"I think a legal framework for regulating who is allowed to employ domestic workers is needed too, as a preventive measure."
11145,I think a lot of Singaporeans have this reversed:  The expats don't come here because juicy jobs naturally happen here.
11146,It is because Singapore has been so friendly to expats that all these juicy jobs popped up here in the first place.
11147,Most Singaporeans AFAIK are okay with manual labour foreign workers.
11148,This will definitely reduce the dependence on migrant workers.
11149,"And then the racism stuff, my non-uni parent is a lot more racist, the other went to Uni in the USA and met black, white, brown, beige, purple people while over there and realized really early on that really people are people."
11150,"It's not that dissimilar to how my grandma would warn us that if we misbehaved, she'll get the (insert super racist term for a night watchman) to kidnap us."
11151,"The more of the world you see, the wider your view becomes and the less easy it is to be racist, sexist, ageist or whatever -ist."
11152,"I think actions done in front of students,especially primary school,seems like a big “OK” to these kinda people cause younger people don’t dare to speak up.And when things like this go unnoticed,they get comfortable using racism as one of their “teaching methods”."
11153,"What makes it ""more"" or ""less"" racist?"
11154,"Does saying ""I'm Chinese, willing to date all races except (insert race here)"" make you less racist than ""only looking for same race""?"
11155,Blurring these lines only make it that much easier for us to set our own goalposts for what racism should be defined as.
11156,I think all foreign workers must have a minimum monthly or daily salaries:  &#x200B;  [https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/sector-specific-rules/services-sector-requirements](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/sector-specific-rules/services-sector-requirements)
11157,At the end of the day it's just to send a message to the onlookers that racism is not ok and let the victim know that you have their back.
11158,"I think as long as your reason is actually relevant to the specific details of the rental, and not based in assumptions stemming from race, then it is not racist?"
11159,"Like if you say blanket ""no Chinese"" yes that's racist, because of course not all Chinese folks burn incense."
11160,"But if you discussed with the potential tenant and explained that for whatever reason you cannot permit incense, but otherwise you will be fine to rent to them, it's not really racist if they decide not to rent after knowing about your requirement."
11161,I think because UAE is being used by people from extremely high-risk countries as stopover to bypass the previous 21 days border measure in place in Singapore.
11162,The expats in my building either bring their own lunch or get subway from downstairs and some of them eat together at the common area.
11163,I think because they’re still throttling the number of passengers coming in with VTL per day anyway.
11164,So at the moment there’s more VTL Plane capacity than VTL coupons being handed out.
11165,No way to expand to the non-VTL flight too and hard to differentiate measures for different passengers off the same plane.
11166,"PRCs have been known to rent out the whole place and then illegally sub-let the unit to more people, so that they can turn a profit, usually to illegal immigrants."
11167,"But I'm not sure if it is linked to the CECA thing at all, these unfair hiring practice would happen even in the absence of such a trade agreement, because Singapore is not the only country where this happens (look at HK for example)."
11168,Having said that these numbers in the dormitory populations are obviously problematic and need to be treated very seriously.
11169,I think employers are wary as some bad apples spoil the market;  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-employers-getting-private-eyes-to-trail-maids
11170,I think everybody knows the racism came from the clients and not the property agent?
11171,I think everyone should be able to speak their mother tongue.
11172,I think for Singaporean expats there is a disconnect between their imagined experience and their actual lived experience.
11173,This disconnect is what I feel leads many Singaporean expats to skew towards the establishment.
11174,"I think for most of us, we see racism as those attacks in America, or probably the latest video on the poly lecturer harassing the couple."
11175,"I guess my question is, where do we really draw the line on racism?"
11176,"So lets say this incident happened again, can I say it is racist because we already addressed this yet it happens again?"
11177,How many times does it have to happen again before it can be considered racist?
11178,Literally highlighting the ridiculousness and racist view points by my friend.
11179,I think global solidarity against racism and oppression of all types is important.
11180,I think he is referring to CECA.
11181,"Anyone who says ""I don't care either way"" is basically saying that they are fine with an incredibly racist law sticking around."
11182,I think he/she is referring to incidents where SG Local indian fucked the expat family for not wearing masks.
11183,Local Indians themselves are getting unhinged at Indian expats...
11184,I think his girlfriend used to work as a maid
11185,If you prefer executives who don't cook I don't think that's racist tbh.
11186,"I think if the maid gets pregnant, the employer will need to pay or something"
11187,"Not just ""fair-weather"" MNCs that are here to enjoy our tax incentives/low tax rates while not contributing meaningfully to create good quality jobs for citizens (who are in here for good), while hiring mostly expats."
11188,"I think in Singapore it is a lot of casual racism which if you take offence to they will classify it as ""oh stop being so sensitive""."
11189,"Some of the things that stuck to me from secondary school were - ""wah you're pretty FOR AN INDIAN"" - ""not to be racist but I would never date an Indian"" - my friend rubbing my hair for fun, his friend to him in chinese ""you sure you want to rub, later your hand smell like the oils they use"" - ""why you so fair, must be a fake indian"" - ""go back to india lah"" (I'm Singaporean since birth)  Entering the workforce, I realised that eventhough a lot of people could speak English they chose to speak Mandarin and it honestly felt very excluding cause everyone around you is engaged in the same topic."
11190,"So racism is here in Singapore, casually at least."
11191,"I think in a lot of countries, this racist guy would be in a coma now."
11192,"- if the landlord is a monolingual elderly, is it still racist to prefer a tenant that he / she can easily communicate with in his / her preferred language?"
11193,"I think in schools, you don't necessarily have to take any specific language for mother tongue."
11194,"I think in some countries only households that really, really need domestic helpers can employ them at a reasonable rate."
11195,There's honestly no reason a young working couple without kids should hire maids.
11196,Either people who are extremely accepting vs. those who are extremely racist.
11197,"There are some pretty fair points mentioned, but there were also some that were pretty racist, even if unintentional."
11198,"Honestly, we are much better off than the US on this front (letting a officer get off scot free is pretty fucked up), but I really hope that Singaporeans experience less casual racism in the future as we become more accepting of each other."
11199,"So yes, we cannot compare immigration in SG because of the number of immigrants but also because policy works differently."
11200,"Expats who do generally not become PRs, PRs and future PRs with specific ethnicity and last but not least the foreign workers."
11201,"Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures."
11202,I have a maid and also a newborn baby.
11203,My maid's duty is to keep the house spick and span basically housekeeping duties on a daily basis.
11204,Honestly Singapore should perhaps  implement a system whereby maids go to employers house during working hours like say 8am-6pm and go back to their own living quarters after.
11205,I will be very happy to have a maid like this.
11206,"It’s standing by and justifying her racist tweets, making flippant comments and inflammatory discourse that could further entrench stereotypes of certain communities, given the influence that she has."
11207,"Only can wait till several generations, then the thing would be done, it’s a more gentle way   for the immigrants, I think it’s more reasonable to test them once the English is more popular inland."
11208,I think it depends on whether if the flight is a VTL flight?
11209,"I think it depends on whether the people are genuinely racist, if not, I don’t think it is justifiable at all."
11210,I think it doesn't make sense for them to pass a language test.
11211,"I think it is possible for you to secure a job in Singapore with your current background, especially if (1) you are fine with a local package with no expat perks like housing etc and (2) you don't mind working at smaller companies/agencies."
11212,"I think it is telling that for a legalistic society like us where we are known for enforcement and punishment, we aren't applying that same energy to domestic workers."
11213,"There's so many areas where throwing the book and more are our preferred solutions but when it is domestic workers, it is all ""guidelines"" and ""advisories""."
11214,I think it is very difficult for the majority to see it through the lenses of the minority (no excuse to be racist and ignorant though!).
11215,"On a national level, how many people in Singapore who were potentially good at coding were denied entry to university along the way at the height of our stupid mandatory mother tongue policy?"
11216,"I think it makes sense because although we are all inoculated, but the foreign workers live in clusters thus the transmission rate is far greater than in the community."
11217,"I think it shows that we're more mature than liberal Western states, who to this day are still in denial, and say that mere ""dialogue and education"" is enough to solve racism."
11218,As if all racists wouldn't be racist any more if someone had a nice honest chat with them.
11219,Standing idly by and doing nothing while your wife starved the maid does the same amount of harm as actually perpetuating the crime itself.
11220,What I suspect LO and other WP MPs will do is (a) condemn xenophobia and racism against migrant workers and Indians and (b) acknowledge Singapore and Singaporeans need to have foreign talent in Singapore.
11221,"Hopefully, they'll also be able to provide constructive criticism and suggestions on Free-Trade Agreements/Govt's immigration policy in general."
11222,"Ideally the Government should protect *everyone* including the expats, because expats being here also result in all sorts of goods and services being consumed by these expats."
11223,"A bunch of expats having to leave would tank the rental market, for starters."
11224,The maid can theoretically sue him for $150000 too
11225,Yeah most younger people aren't as racist or xenophobic... but I do see it increase as they get older.
11226,https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-replies/2011/5000-security-bond-not-forfeited-if-maids-get-pr  It used to be that the 5000 dollars bond got confiscated if the maid became pregnant
11227,I think it's a lot more hurtful for institutionalised racism to be allowed than only stopping when they are blatantly racist.
11228,"I think it's a question of whether the government is suppressing or allowing racism.. You'll find racism anywhere, but where I'm from (Norway) We have laws that make it illegal to post ads like this.."
11229,I think it's an offence to let a maid work in other premises other that what she's registered under.
11230,"While it may be true for some, it's also good to note that there are a lot more Singaporeans who give them the stink eye, and the increasing xenophobia doesn't help either."
11231,"Never really experienced or witnessed any racism or feelings of superiority from PRCs to SG Indians, but that's just my view."
11232,Hence why we are all so eager to put everybody in the CMIO box.
11233,"I think it's even more racist to deny that there are differences between Singapore Chinese, and China Chinese."
11234,You're essentially agreeing with the racists that Chinese everywhere are the same.
11235,"I think it's fine to acknowledge that LKY's views are reflective of a certain era, but in the same vein, it's also fine (and important) to also frankly acknowledged that these views would be regarded as racist today."
11236,"However, calling it the ""curry smell"" could be construed as racist."
11237,"Singaporean residency is highly desirable, and if you look at expat forums online you see tons of stories of people not even being able to get PRs, let alone citizenships, despite being highly qualified."
11238,"Literally the only people who can get citizenship relatively easily are people who fall under the GIP scheme, which is quite selective (for example, for a business owner, your company must have over $200 million turnover and you must invest 2.5 million into a local business entity or into other local businesses, and for a 5 year PR renewal your business needs to employ a minimum of 5 Singaporean citizens), or those who are Malaysian Chinese."
11239,I think it's hard for expats to feel welcome in HDB.
11240,I think it's hard for expats to feel welcome in HDB.
11241,The real problem is when the domestic helper is not aware of the laws and don't know how to report to get their employer in trouble.
11242,"As a Chinese-Thai, I get racist jokes on both ends of the spectrum: from things like 'Ching Chong Ling Long' to 'Is your mother a woman?'"
11243,"There way it sounds to me, foreign workers from China are ranked way low in most people's list."
11244,I think it's more of stereotyping than racism.
11245,First we have to acknowledge that TCB does know that there still an approval process for employment passes and S passes.
11246,"The way to expose it is that you go up to any foreign employee from India and ask whether they have a workpass or employment pass, and they show you they have an employment pass."
11247,Free movement as stated based upon the CECA agreement is that there is no hindrance or testing for the approval of said passes except in specific areas as stated in the agreement.
11248,The purpose of Section 9 of CECA is to streamline the process of people moving between India and SIngapore.
11249,Generally foreign workers are men who also do not have alot of money ?
11250,"Like your mum/wife/gf would say ""go do yourself la, you think I your maid isit?"""
11251,"Yeah, sure, there's plenty of racism and inequality in Singapore."
11252,"Endemic and systemic racism is also wrong, and also sinister."
11253,"I call them maids, because that was the vernacular we used while growing up."
11254,(90's kid)  Then people became more politically correct and the next generation calls them domestic worker / helper.
11255,I think its because the boomers have created a boundary (rulebook) for what is acceptable racism and what's not.
11256,"Any racism that is covert and said/practiced in closed door to them, is acceptable."
11257,"Which is why the same people who denounce the red shirt Chinese man and the incident as racist, will also be the one who would be OK with racial ""preference"" in dating/marriage, rental market or workplace (which leads to Mandarin speakers only job ads)."
11258,"What many are denouncing, is the public display of racism."
11259,"To be labelled as the racist community is the last thing they (those that are racist) want, because they know what negative labels can do, all too well  Read what MinShan wrote again, and he seems to be only surprised by the ""in your face"", ""open"" racism."
11260,"Ive so far not heard any Ministers champion against casual racism, racism in rental market or in employment practices."
11261,"And I believe, that the Govt is not too bothered about prevailing racism, so long as it does not come out into the public."
11262,"For work permit holders, lodging cost cannot be more than 25% of their salary."
11263,Landlords are quite racist.
11264,I think its mostly the class clowns trying to funny and it just do happens that racist jokes are a low effort way of doing it.
11265,We dont know enough about american situation with racism.
11266,And on top of the cake they blame people who do not take real Action towards ending racism is in fact racism.
11267,"Methinks XX supporters are closeted bigots/racists themselves, and they support her bc she loudly echoes the internal thoughts they _wish_ they could say out loud."
11268,I think it’s a stupid term but an immigrant is someone who has a path to residency in another country and takes it.
11269,I think it’s almost a norm that the younger generation can’t speak their mother tongue.
11270,"In my social circle, people aren’t negative towards non-mother tongue speakers."
11271,"Flew on one of the early VTLs and it was half empty, took one back recently from London and it was fully booked and looking like how it was back before Covid."
11272,Also the term helper/maid is becoming more derogatory.
11273,"Not that that’s what happens in SG, though the general attitude towards and treatment of foreign workers is still pretty appalling."
11274,"I don't know who had the required level of salt to label it xenophobic, but it's just English."
11275,The problem i had was that my 'mother tongue' really wasn't my mother tongue and no one spoke it at home.
11276,"I think live-in maids is justifiable for families with young kids, seniors and disabled members."
11277,"I think mom should collect levies for foreign talent, if they want to push for a hire Singaporean first policy in companies."
11278,They have been complaining about PAP giving preferential treatment to expats in the past and demanding jobs go to locals.
11279,I think most people are somewhat lukewarm towards new immigrants *in general*.
11280,"The expectation that Singaporeans should specifically be *more* welcoming towards those who come from mainland China (than immigrants of other races) because of some warped notion of ""shared heritage""."
11281,"This expectation is particularly abrasive when coming from authorities, but even more so when expressed by (a small but vocal minority) of the said immigrants."
11282,I think it is the 12-16 individuals in a room + the general attitude towards foreign workers that needs to be discussed.
11283,"Everyone also claims they are not racist/elitist/xenophobic/homophobic (which is true, they are not openly so) but their attitudes are obvious from their actions/patronizing behavior."
11284,"I think not just that lah, also high demand, especially since VTL flights are designated and limited."
11285,"So reading that lots of expats (not just in SG) who usually mingle among only the same kind, is what worries me the most, if I do decide to settle down somewhere else."
11286,"I think often times we talk about what kind of punishment we need to give these monsters, but the root cause is definitely the dehumanisation of migrant workers."
11287,"We act like “oh, there’s racial harmony in Singapore, therefore I cannot be racist!” So when we say or do anything racist, we “justify” it by thinking, “I can’t be racist, so it must be true instead!”   Many people I see irl who are racist, genuinely don’t see Chinese/Indian immigrants for their race, but the fact that they are immigrants (sorry for taking this long to reach the topic) but end up using their race’s stereotype to insult them."
11288,"People seem to lump in Indian locals with Indian immigrants and basically been treating both group similarly, and the xenophobia now affects local Indians as well."
11289,"And for Chinese immigrants, somehow people have got it in their heads that they’re “allowed” to just insult them, like it’s okay to go, “HAHA China accent” and start mocking their accent, or to treat them like shit in general."
11290,The issue probably would be that for a lot of people in their support base CECA is the hill they choose to die on.
11291,They might probably receive some criticism from their supporters on why didn't they join PSP in criticising CECA more vigorously.
11292,"I think over the last five years, I've only encountered racism once, and it was extremely minor."
11293,"I think people are mixing up multiple issues here, with the key ones being: - Is there unfair hiring/preferential hiring in workplace by foreign nationals for people from back home - Is CECA the main cause of the problem above - Is CECA good for Singapore  My take (in reverse order) is that: - CECA could be beneficial to Singaporeans if properly implemented."
11294,"Today there are risks of exploitation that has gotten many locals and expats concerned  - CECA is not the main cause of unfair or preferential hiring practices, but it could be exploited by some to make it easier to hire only folks from their own nationality  - Unfair and preferential hiring is a serious issue especially in sectors with desired jobs such as tech, IT and finance."
11295,"- While discussions around CECA are good, it seems more as a way to draw attention away from other issues such as unfair hiring practices which are more difficult/less willing to address"
11296,"I think people are rightfully pissed at the government, and that's leading to (wrongful) xenophobia."
11297,But the xenophobia is just an ugly response to that.
11298,"So in a way, the government is partially responsible for bringing out this xenophobia in people."
11299,"We're a barely cohesive multicultural society because of such segregation and underlying tones of racism even within our government, and you're right that we have these policies to thank, because without them we might have actually thought of better ways to unify so that future Alsagofs wouldn't appear."
11300,"I think people treat not only maids, but foreign workers very badly as well."
11301,"They can at least be a bit more polite right there's another human being on the other side leh that's quite hurtful even if you racist you don't just tell minorities ""sorry don't like Indians"""
11302,Would it be natural for someone from a more 'enlightened' country/society to develop a racist attitude towards the Japanese if they are exposed to it?
11303,"I think she is entitled to take the position, in good faith, that this is an racist incident."
11304,"Now, if we accept the above, it is a reasonable and natural thing for her to obtain public feedback if she feels (again in good faith) that this incident has issues of racism."
11305,I think she is the in-laws' maid.
11306,"Victim gets sick, sent off to in-law's home (so abuser's son don't get sick)  Abusers come to collect victim, victim does not want to leave  Abusers abuse victim again, in-law's maid calls agency."
11307,Plus there is no VTL economy option at all
11308,I think some maids have had it bad for a long time.
11309,I think sometimes people forget that even domestic workers have dreams.
11310,I think such racist behaviour was kind of taught when young.
11311,Just because you see some Indians as construction workers or migrant workers should not means that ALL Indians work in such sector.
11312,I think that racism should be stopped.
11313,"I think that all these people who are so hung up on racist issues, have this belief that ""**life should be fair**""."
11314,"For instance, during my grandparents time (the 1920s to 1940s) the vast majority of people here were immigrants so it wasn't really natives vs immigrants but where you immigrated from."
11315,"Now when there is already an established base of born and bred here Singaporeans naturally, there would be some tension between them and new immigrants."
11316,The China (PRC) of today is not the China (KMT/ROC) that most Chinese immigrant to Singapore left in the early days.
11317,and certainly acknowledging BLM elsewhere doesn’t mean we are blind to racism in sg - at least they are engaging with issues of race.
11318,"It seems to me to be a form of appeasement - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement  As to why there is such a huge outrage when there is racism towards locals, let's use an analogy: would you be outraged if someone came into your house and insulted you?"
11319,I think that is a subset of the mentality that explains why there are some cases of maids being treated like abused animals here.
11320,The government can say CECA isn't the reason peoples jobs are being taken sure.
11321,"But if the problem is real and it persists, then they should focus more on finding the root of the problem and solving it as opposed to simply saying it isn't from CECA."
11322,"to ensure affordable housing for all), rather than to fan the flames of racism."
11323,"No doubt, racism (or more correctly identified, differences in race) comes as a natural corollary to most of the policies and is unavoidable since it is a fact that there is more than one race in Singapore."
11324,"Such policies may have the unintentional effect of creating ‘racist’ sentiments, but the fixation on race could be also because some people identify/interpret the presence of racial differences in policies, and every other thing for that matter, when there is arguably none."
11325,I think that the reason why mother tongue is so neglected is because the importance of English was deemed so high that it renders all other languages second-rate.
11326,Knowing one's mother tongue was taken to be of little importance especially.
11327,"I understand your concerns about labelling *persons* as “racist”, but sometimes if it walks and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck."
11328,I think that's the same issue with immigrants in most developed countries.
11329,I think that's the whole criticism of having live-in maids.
11330,So the compromise is to ban live-in domestic workers.
11331,Saying this is the cheaper option disregards the costs of the lives of the foreign workers.
11332,"If we accept that there is a problem of overcrowding, we must also accept that there will need to be a reduction in the number of immigrants in all areas of the economy, whether high or low skill."
11333,I think an auction based system would be a great way to reduce our overreliance on low skill immigrant labour (work permit holdier like construction/cleaners).
11334,"And he only killed a “maid”, so what’s all this drama about."
11335,I think the author is confusing racism with systemic racism.
11336,"Anyone can experience racism or be a racist, so long as it is a prejudice based on race."
11337,"But not everyone experiences systemic racism, which is far more widespread, insidious and upheld by social, economic, educational and government institutions."
11338,"Reverse racism is another category entirely, steeped in the belief that affirmative action in itself is racist because it favours minorities."
11339,I think the backlash against CECA is a symptom of the underlying root cause of growing inequality.
11340,"I think the big problem is not explicit racism, I don't think people in the right mind try to be explicitly racist."
11341,The problem is implicit racism caused by subconscious bias; i.e.
11342,ppl tending to make choices or decisions that are subconsciously racist in one way or another without evern realizing that they're being racist.
11343,I think the bigger implication here is whether the expat levels will resume after covid is over and how these unfriendly policies affects future expat growth macam some Yelp review but on a country level.
11344,I think the biggest issue for most expats are the borders.
11345,The truth of the matter is that most Singaporeans don't interact much with both foreign workers and the quarantined imported cases.
11346,I think the citizens are more upset about the government than the immigrants.
11347,"If I randomly stopped you on the street as part of a survey and ask you to answer me immediately what's the difference between a formal qipao and a wedding qipao, and you are unable to answer it, I'll be able to convincingly say that you're ignorant, but not racist."
11348,"Lastly, you don't need an intent to hurt to be racist."
11349,"Casual racism and subtle prejudice exist, and it's something that minority races have been trying to tell us that for the longest time."
11350,"When we got here, we treated our domestic helper very well and she was genuinely shocked for the first couple of weeks at how she was being treated."
11351,I personally don't think it's racist to not like the smell of curry but I'm peranakan so I make curries myself lol
11352,"I think the government's perceived failings in its border policies with India probably made the xenophobia worse yes, but I still think the focus should be more on fighting xenophobia and racism in response to this specific incident, instead of the immigration and border control policies (these should still be discussed, but just not as the main cause of this incident)."
11353,The reason is that xenophobic and racist attacks are rarely logical - we have no way of guaranteeing these attacks won't happen even if the government had acted perfectly.
11354,"If people really start to buy into the xenophobia (like some Trump supporters for example) and it becomes this blind rage, no matter how you try to tweak policies it's not going to stop the hate, because the xenophobia will take on a life of its own."
11355,Another reason we should separate the issues is that we don't want to be seen as excusing xenophobic attacks just because the government fucked up.
11356,The responsibility and punishment should still fall primaily on the perpetrators of hate crimes and people who wish to spread xenophobia for the sake of it.
11357,We think that's an excuse to say we're not racist in any way.
11358,"So singaporeans might be accepting of black people, but they might see them as fundamentally different from the migrant worker community, or people other than default singaporean stereotypes."
11359,I honestly dont think such casual racism spawns from ill-intent but rather from the fact that sterotypes are an effective way to get a laugh from an immature audience .
11360,"While the racist aspect is undeniable, I think both sides are shitheads."
11361,"For example, it can both be true that CECA does not allow 100% free movement, and the barriers to entry being so low that just about any Tom, Dick and Harry can come in without the proper vetting and QC."
11362,"Second, it may be true that immigrants are vital for the continuous growth of Singapore, but this also brings with it challenges and problems, which the government does not seem to be managing all that well."
11363,"The unhappiness over CECA is but the harbinger of bigger problems to come, stemming from a growing unhappiness and disenfranchisement with the government."
11364,"I think the maid can only speak Tamil and not much English, and Jane the tenant cannot speak Tamil"
11365,I think the main issue is that a lot of the food suppliers to migrant workers have to [keep their cost of producing each meal to max $2](https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/trending/meals-for-migrant-workers-by-top-singapore-chefs-12676296) to qualify for government funding.
11366,I think the main problem with our domestic worker policy is the requirement for the worker to live with their employers.
11367,The same argument can be made for why there's a lack of interest towards the mother tongues these days since students do not see their 'mother tongue' as a necessary language in their daily lives (e.g.
11368,"Besides, if a 'regular' netizen made a racist comment on their public facebook page, they'd be getting lots of flak - no doubt."
11369,"I don't think that ""it can't be helped if the market values your labour at a below subsistence level"" is an adequate response to that either, because what is oestensibly the free market in singapore is constantly intervened with already (foreign worker policy, taxation/tax breaks in various industries, etc.)."
11370,"I think the point being made is that while the govt tells people not to be racists, their other actions (i.e."
11371,"I agree that racism is still a thing in SG, but just because it exists does not mean the govt has to bend to it (if that's what they're actually doing wrt the PM & President issue, but I doubt it)."
11372,"Instead by hiding behind ""public sentiments"" they're either conceding ground to racists or (IMO, more likely) being disingenuous about their real intentions."
11373,"I think the point of contact should be the maid agency, not reddit."
11374,"I think the problem is most expats in Singapore know a lot of the center (town/city) area of Singapore, but not much about the peripherals (our version of the burbs)."
11375,"Most expats know everything within these areas, but outside of that is another world."
11376,I think the problem is she was both elitist AND racist in the same statement.
11377,I reckon the outrage from the elitist element was transferred into the racist outrage.
11378,I think the problem is that he's given cover to racists and apathetic citizens to cite the PM in saying that there's no Chinese privilege even though he's not talking about the same kind of Chinese privilege that people are trying to raise awareness about.
11379,I think the problem is that most expats would choose to live in central so you do witness a decline in rental prices in this area.
11380,"While I don't believe that those who did that was being racist or what not, they should not have been so quick to end the discussion with her."
11381,"I think the race issue is that the minority races can't ""play the HDB game"" equally with other races if they wanted to  But it comes with benefits too, as minorities get to live in prime developments at a lower price tier and at near guaranteed chance, so its not all bad, just tt racial segregation for any intent and purpose, is racist"
11382,I think the racism in Singapore is mostly under the skin.
11383,"I've heard more people acting racist in other countries, but I've seen far more people making racist assumptions in Singapore."
11384,I think the racism is pretty apparent.
11385,I think the real myth here is that Singapore's society is somehow supposed to be above the rampant racism that is plaguing Western society.
11386,I think the right not to be responsible for maid’s pregnancy would be a nice start.
11387,I think the silver lining is we'll see improvements in how we treat our foreign workers.
11388,"This is absolutely not racist, after all, how many of you are English?"
11389,I think the stereotype is that westerners in general treat maids better.
11390,So it depends on where the expats are from.
11391,"Ignorance and ingrained prejudices are much harder to deal with than overt, violent racism precisely because they *aren't* meant maliciously"
11392,"I think the view is also distorted by the fact usually expats comes because they got some good offers to come, meaning some highly skilled or upper management positions with generally high income, hence comparison is highly unfair in favor of expats as there are no expats coming to start hawker stall..."
11393,"However at the same time you have foreign workers from India and such doing dirty jobs for very cheap and nobody is counting them into the metrics, effectively dividing the whole problem and point out only ""the white rich assholes"" nobody is pointing to poor Indian bros giving their sweat and blood for few bucks an hour into your new HDB funded via CPF and thinking they got it pretty good after all"
11394,"For owners, they want to choose clients that are predisposed to take care of the place, hence you see criteria like ""female only"", ""no Indians"", ""professionals only"" because if the owner were to ask ""people who take care of the property"" you can bet everyone will say they are even if they are not  These are very racist/sexist/elitist views."
11395,I think there are more racial profiling more than racism happening...
11396,Racism and xenophobia is just a lazy scapegoat to the real issues
11397,"I think there is a problem in certain pockets of the financial industry as I have discussed numerous times, but going about it like this is in very poor taste and gives an avenue for all closet racists to come out and say whatever shit they want to say."
11398,"However, OP seems to want to drive this conversation in a certain way to highlight that SAP schools are a form of ""systemic racism"", has gone out of the way to negate some of the valid points that others have brought up about the creation of SAP schools."
11399,"I think there is an underlying problem, just that CECA is not the source as people widely believed."
11400,People suspected it was due to intra-corporate transferees from CECA.
11401,But we also need to consider cases where it could be purely the maid's fault or no one's fault at all.
11402,I think there's a difference between something being racial and something being racist.
11403,"And even in such an event, with the VTL flight comprising infection-resistant vaccinated people and the post-arrival rapid-PCR test being mandatory for every passenger, how likely is it that the Singaporean causes serious contagion?"
11404,ICA already mandates the statutory declaration for all VTL passengers; they just need to add a question for vaccination.
11405,Asians are non-confrontational and since these expats are on timed assignments people just tolerate it and wait for them to leave.
11406,There's a Facebook page called 'Traveling in and out of Singapore' - check it out for updates from other people using VTLs
11407,I think they need stronger rules to allow the maids to leave though.
11408,There have been quite a few cases where the maids weren't allowed to go back
11409,Why can't more employers allow domestic helpers to go for daily jogs/walks at nearby parks?
11410,I think they teaching the expat the English used in Singapore office where all our English is actually quite good after we codeswap.
11411,This will leave no room for ambiguity on the issue of exclusion / racism.
11412,"And as Minister for Manpower, foreign workers are seen as her responsibility and she effed that up by allowing covid19 to spread amongst 'her people', and is thus seen as the main culprit behind our continued covid19 spread."
11413,I think this has definitely been a wake-up call for the authorities and finally giving the plight of these migrant workers a much-needed exposure in the media.
11414,I think this incident finally wakes Singaporeans the fuck up on how immoral we treat our foreign workers.
11415,Sweeping racism under the carpet isn't removing it.
11416,"Like I said in the other thread, the PA has been really smart in a way about making it about racism or alleged racism and distracting people from their actions."
11417,"I think this is a good time to also point out how a lot of the go-to counter arguments being made about racism in SG goes like: ""well Indians are racist to their own,"" or ""minorities can be racist also."""
11418,"When minorities talk about racism in SG, it's referring to these exact scenarios."
11419,"I'm not saying that other forms of racism are invalid or unworthy to talk about, but I really hope more people realize that it comes across as insensitive and deflecting the conversation from what actually needs to be discussed."
11420,"I think this is ivory tower classism more than anything (with a slight racist tinge), if there were lower-class Singaporeans doing all the construction, it doesn't take much imagination to see her saying the same."
11421,"Race is a sensitive topic in Singapore which I feel that most politicians do not dare to go deeper into the topic beyond the ""let's not do racist act"" talk."
11422,"I think this is the biggest scoop:  >From next Tuesday (Feb 22), VTL travellers and those from countries and    places deemed to be of low Covid-19 risk, will be able to take a    supervised antigen rapid test (ART) within 24 hours of their arrival,    instead of having to go through a polymerase chain reaction test that is    more costly."
11423,Imagine if how this person will treat his/her maid.
11424,"A possible increase in the construction and maintenance cost (which will find its way to Singapore public in general) can be partially, or even completely offset from the current foreign worker levies that the government has been collecting."
11425,"I think this person added the edit after most people saw the comment, so not sure it is really representative Source: I replied to the comment but i didnt see the racist stuff till just now"
11426,I think this point tells me that local Chinese are pretty cognizant of differentiating themselves from PRC immigrants that might come over...Chinese is already the majority race if the govt lets more PRCs come in the racial balance will be way too skewed
11427,"If they say ""indians eat curry hence indians smelly"" then you definitely have a point about racism."
11428,I think those examples you listed are isolated cases of racism.
11429,"Fact is, I don't think it matters where you go in the world, there will always be individuals who are racist against minorities."
11430,"Prior to the purpose built worker dorms being built, you had migrant workers anything from 20 migrant workers cramped into a 3 room hdb sized unit."
11431,Singapore's immigration policy is really the lack of one.
11432,"In my view unless we adopt a more ""pathway to citizenship"" immigration policy like what Canada, New Zealand, Australia does, local - foreigner divide will also be present in our society."
11433,"As others have have pointed out this anti-CECA is but the latest in a series of Us vs Them in our history, stretching back to when Raffles decided this place is great for colonial enterprise."
11434,"That is, a child's character can still be built and values inculcated with tasks that do not overlap with the services of a domestic helper."
11435,These FDWs have loans to pay back from day one.
11436,"The narrative from the government is Singaporeans are not good enough, and we need foreign talents or else we cannot survive."
11437,"We have too many so-called foreign talents in middle management in accounting, finance, sales, admin when many of these roles can be fulfilled by locals."
11438,And there is absolutely no indicator from the government that restrictions will be loosened for migrant workers once we hit whatever vaccination thresholds we have for the general community.
11439,"If we think that there is no clear exit roadmap for us in the community, there is not even the slightest indication of one for the migrant workers."
11440,"This does not exist for foreign domestic workers, and it will be a monumental task to create such a venue for them as we have over 250,000 foreign domestic workers in Singapore."
11441,"This means that with Singapore Expo, Changi Exhibition Centre, and D'Resort combined, the government was only able to find sufficient space for what will be 7% of the foreign domestic worker population in Singapore."
11442,"In other words, if we want to create a space for foreign domestic workers to meet their friends with proper social distancing protocols, we will need a venue (or sum equivalent venues) with a capacity for 15x that of Singapore Expo, Changi Exhibition Centre, and D'Resort combined."
11443,"Don't forget that many of our large venues like army camps, empty schools, and cruise ships are currently housing foreign workers who test negative for Covid-19, so we can't use those."
11444,Any resources sent towards helping maids meet their friends means less resources on other pressing issues.
11445,I think we never taught to treat foreign workers as equals but rather beneath us.
11446,I think we should come up with a course for employers to complete before they are allowed to hire domestic workers.
11447,"So over all weekends over 3months, the hiring family will be put thru everything a domestic worker goes thru."
11448,Then they will be assessed to see if they are able to empathise with situations a domestic worker will sometimes be in.
11449,"Not only, if our government claims that costs prohibit improving the welfare of the migrant workers (see the transport issue), then it would be of public interest to know how the levies are being spent."
11450,">also, AFAIK, the purpose of the levies is not to provide better conditions for migrant workers, but to regulate how many of them work in Singapore."
11451,"I think we shouldn't be making racist jokes, period."
11452,"Singapore hasn't imposed any travel restrictions yet, so we're on the other extreme, although China herself has banned outbound traffic from the worst-hit zones."
11453,"On racism, even at its worst, racism usually doesn't result in physical violence."
11454,It is possible that most people in Singapore grew up with some racist stereotypes passed down from their parents.
11455,"So you may get racist remarks, but rarely violence."
11456,"To be honest, just a personal opinion, but I think racism may be worse towards Indians than Africans for races with darker skin colour because of a recent pact with India that has more foreigner Indians perceived to be stealing jobs from locals."
11457,"Africans are more of an unknown as they are not common here, so there may be more looks of curiosity than racist looks."
11458,"Besides, if you're here as an expat, you're more likely to be treated well."
11459,Many Singaporeans are more elitist than racist (which is itself another problem but well).
11460,What would be the mother tongue language of instruction?
11461,I wouldn't say that foreign workers can't integrate.
11462,Some of the examples the thread starter gave are also xenophobia rather than racism.
11463,"I think generally, Singaporeans are more xenophobic than racist."
11464,I think what the Pirate is saying is that casually acknowledging the racism is as bad as the racism itself.
11465,"However, I also see these same people posting well written and thought out takes on BLM, using it educate others on racism or even as a jump start to have conversations about racial dynamics in Singapore."
11466,The issue I have with the whole discourse is that they tend to flame the issue and direct the conversation in a xenophobic manner.
11467,Millennials living in liberal US cities and colleges are far more careful about casual racism than most Singaporeans.
11468,"There is a thin line between family and maid, and she clearly crossed the line."
11469,What i meant by the line is that the maid should not be disrespectful to the employer.
11470,I think you are mixing up racism and xenophobia.
11471,Thus the reliance on foreign workers.
11472,"At the height of the mandatory mother tongue policy in the nineties or oughts, if you failed, or more likely failed to get a competitive grade vs your peers in your mother tongue in Primary 4 ( age 10) or Primary 6 ( age 12) etc, you would be streamed out of an educational pathway that would make entry into a local university very very difficult."
11473,Even a low passing grade in your mother tongue would be enough to damage your aggregate score at any of these junctures to severely damage your chances at being in the 20% even if you got exceptional grades in every other subject.
11474,"The fundamental problem here really isn't just the mandatory mother tongue, but it is the mandatory mother tongue policy couple with the streaming coupled with the really stupid racist way Chinese was taught in Singapore."
11475,I was lucky because my father got posted as an expat to Australia when I was in Primary school and we were able to afford for me to go to a very good school in the US for engineering and I was able to built the beginning of my career there.
11476,If we are not restricting all PRs and S pass holders at this point.
11477,I think you have the right intentions but if you think its not racism and xenophobic then you're trying to ignore it pretty hard.
11478,"People throw CECA around at local Indians like that boy whenever they want to hate on an Indian, regardless nationality."
11479,I think you made an important point that the experience of racism varies from person to person.
11480,"An incident may feel racist to a person, yet indifferent to others."
11481,"When a person is sharing their experience of racism in an open space, they should be ready to accept differing experience of that same situation."
11482,"Finally, as the OP has implicitly suggest, racism is a subjective experience (different from person to person)."
11483,"Generally speaking, the expats who are planning on leaving, or have already left, are the highly mobile ones who know they can get jobs easily anywhere."
11484,"I work in finance, and there are so many CECA brought over to take jobs that could have gone to locals."
11485,"Although I have faced racism or racial prejudices at every stage of my life, I have also been lucky to have met atleast 2-3 Chinese guys who dnt see me for my race or color of my skin, and treats me like a fellow human being, and not reference my strengths and flaws to my race."
11486,> I feel offended when we all get sweeped into this just because of a few minority racists as if there is an epidemic of racist chinese in Singapore towards Indians.
11487,"Basically, we know the majority are not racist."
11488,"As an example, generalizing german engineering is NOT racism."
11489,I would find it ridiculous you think that's racism because that's an industry norm.
11490,It's like saying buying american stovetops is racism because somehow having a reputation in that trade is now racist.
11491,"But generalizing people **not because of the color of their skin** but by actual attributes is what people do everyday, and that is **not the same as racism**."
11492,"What we want is a necessary push-back against extremist narratives that has been establishing itself in /r/Singapore (i.e., that immigrants are just here to steal all our jobs and Indians are all degree scammers)."
11493,The nativists and extremists have never hesitated to drown comments containing the slightest hint of pro-immigrant sentiment with downvotes.
11494,"The result is that in many of the biggest threads discussing immigration, the top comments are overwhelmingly anti-immigrant (particularly against Indian immigrants), and all the pro-immigrant comments are hidden because of negative karma."
11495,"In such an environment, people who may be pro immigrant will naturally hesitate to voice their opinions to avoid getting attacked and downvoted in an apparent hostile environment, while people on the fence will get the impression that everyone in Singapore hates foreigners (when this may not be the case) and start to wonder if they should as well."
11496,"I also disagree that people who make xenophobic comments are ""victims"" because available employment data and median wage data don't support the idea that foreigners are stealing local jobs or that there is significant underemployment due to immigration, but I am happy to look at evidence to the contrary if you have any."
11497,I'm saying the reason why we NEED reserved presidency and GRCs is because Singapore still has problems with racism.
11498,I think you must appreciate the fact that there are racist incidents towards the Chinese in Singapore but the government doesn't emphasize it as much as racist incidents towards minorities.
11499,The Straits Times and CNA do not emphasize these racist incidents towards the Chinese as much as minorities.
11500,"As some have pointed out, you aren't the first expat to move here and there are tons of forums where those exact questions have been asked a hundred times."
11501,Start here: [https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/](https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/)
11502,"Look at their recent immigration policy of allowing all ethnic Chinese to apply for a special visa allowing them to stay in China for up to five years, and the CCP saying how they're welcome of all Chinese returning ""home""."
11503,"So I'm not saying that it's ok to be racist to Chinese, but that the CCP is basically adding fuel to the fire with their ahem, firey, rhetoric."
11504,"I think you would need to ask yourself this question, by advocating this motion - would more foreign workers lose their jobs?"
11505,CECA and FW are not the same thing right?
11506,"Anyways there are a lot of locals, expats, FW and tourists who patronise Mustafa."
11507,"There are plenty of people who are *knowingly racist*, and that's an issue that comes not from being out of touch with minorities, but from primitive instincts and flaws with personal character."
11508,"I think you're pointing the finger at the wrong cause - not the speak Mandarin campaign (which was part of a whole movement that's been wiping out dialect usage on the island), but the rule that students must only do their 'mother tongue' and not just pick a second language."
11509,"At this point, short of drastically changing how we employ maids (maybe they can live in a dorm together and commute instead, I don't know) I just don't see a good way of dealing with this stain on our national conscience."
11510,There's only racism.
11511,And racism is usually practiced by the majority group of people in this country.
11512,A racist Chinese lady wouldn't go to India in the first place la.
11513,"Since we're on the topic of minorities being plausible to be racist towards the majorities, certain people in the minority group can have prejudice towards Chinese."
11514,Fellow racist Chinese people who have been racist to their loved ones.
11515,"I would have to agree with u/ActualComfort6's points on the examples presented with the ""mother tongue"" and ""racial language""."
11516,"the word ""unpleasant"" gives an unpleasant connotation to ""expatriate"" that leads to stereotyping and generalizations."
11517,We are not xenophobic people.
11518,We feel that the government need to slow their pace down in allowing immigrants to come in.
11519,I think you've not been on the receiving end of this CECA policy before hence your stance.
11520,"Whilst there might be some xenophobia laced it in, there absolutely are real issues and problems behind the whole thing, and I say this as someone who has had to go through the very odd experience of being a minority in my workplace whilst being in Singapore."
11521,Labeling the whole thing as xenophobia is brushing away the underlying issues too easily
11522,"In cases where there are disputes, the FDW can turn around and claim that their passport was withheld."
11523,You can see from the responses you got that some people will side with the FDW based on your description alone.
11524,It's better to provide a cabinet/wardrobe with a lock for the FDW and make clear to her that her valuables are her own responsibility.
11525,"Does this not actually further support the theory that Singaporeans might be xenophobic, because how they treat someone may depend on their answer to this question?"
11526,"[let me know if I got the sequence wrongly]  On to point 2, I have always asked for research on foreign workers working conditions in other countries."
11527,"We always say foreign workers conditions are poor in SG, what's the standards are we comparing to?"
11528,Lol  Anwyay I am genuinely interested and want to know more about the foreign workers international standards.
11529,"Just be honest and mention that you're not racist, but cannot stand the curry lor."
11530,"I think your suggestions are valid, but it is also prudent to consider the economic and infrastructure implications of having maids live in dorms."
11531,"Current statistics show that approximately 20% of households in Singapore have maids - about 200,000 maids live on our island."
11532,There are costs required in finding/building accommodation for these huge numbers of maids.
11533,Or will the government have to step in - and face discontent from 80% of Singaporeans who feel that their taxes are subsidizing the rich households who have maids.
11534,"Not to mention that these buildings will most likely be located in far-flung estates, perhaps near current foreign worker dormitories, because Singaporeans won't want to live near such housing (e.g."
11535,This means that maids will have to use public transport to commute between the dorm and employer's house.
11536,"In addition, we need to consider that there are certain households who require live-in maids."
11537,A significant number of maids who act as caretakers for elderly folk that live alone.
11538,"Rather than going straight to solutions that require infrastructure and long-term investments, a more fiscally- and socially-sound solution would be to create more avenues for maids to report abusive employers and encourage them to seek help."
11539,"I think you’re really overthinking it, amidst the arising racism posts and concerns, MOST Singaporeans in public do not give a rat ass about what the other person looks like."
11540,OP’s friends may very likely be ignorant and that is a huge part of racism.
11541,I thoroughly agree that our treatment of domestic helpers and foreign workers is deplorable.
11542,"Many maids in Singapore are treated little better than slaves, with a thin veneer of civility."
11543,"I thought American companies have expat packages too, but after talking to people I learnt that only the really high ranking people get it or they've done away with it altogether, just pay them high enough local packages."
11544,In the past they had expat packages because coming to Singapore was considered hardship?
11545,"For expats in Japanese companies, even an assistant manager in his 20s who's here for 2 years can get to stay in a $3500/month condo by himself, meanwhile a local staff of similar age earns less than what the company pays for his monthly rent."
11546,Or racism.
11547,One can't help but wonder if racism today has something to do with it.
11548,I thought Singapore already imported many foreign tech talent from India under CECA.
11549,I thought a racist comment has to derogatory in some way?
11550,"Perhaps something as simple as adding a hashtag (like #unforgottensg) to all the fact-checkable things done by the powers that be that objectively steered the country the wrong way, say for example the recent KTV cluster, the RV axe murder, the not so recent MOM debacle involving our migrant workers etc."
11551,"I'm not talking about the ""little"" blunders like the CECA coverup (CECA itself sounds like a major blunder though) or having overspent by $5m on fitness trackers."
11552,I thought it was a rule to compensate FDW if they are at home on off days
11553,Defends SAP schools and madrasahs as attempting to preserve a bastion of mother tongue culture and not let the young be poor imitations of Europeans and Americans.
11554,"I thought it’s fine as long as you go back to the VTL country and stay for 2 weeks minimum before flying back to Sg, am I wrong about this?"
11555,I thought number of PR approvals per year have been stagnant for years.
11556,I thought only elites ill treat their maids  /s
11557,"If i had nothing on my plate, I would offer to drive these foreign workers to Changi Airport myself and bade them good bye."
11558,I thought the PM established that there’s no racism in Singapore.
11559,"I thought the same: expats leaving, no new foreigners allowed to come in."
11560,">​Seeing that it was difficult for Mdm Sujeewa to juggle studying and taking care of the household at the same time, Yuen hired another domestic worker to assist her with the household chores to enable her to have more time to “study and learn”."
11561,The whole what-is-the-definition-of-racism quibble is a whole diff matter- like its more trying to diminish the situation’s severity... which im curious to know why it is in so many replies in this post?
11562,"I told him that the abuser wasn't even Chinese, and he replied that it's the government's fault for encouraging people to hire maids..."
11563,I took 3 VTL flights and 1 non-VTL flight.
11564,"I was joking with friends that VTL flight is completely full, but no quarantine required."
11565,And non-VTL (which is very sparsely occupied) has quarantine requirement.
11566,Kinda hoping that the VTL can be extended at least to the neighbouring countries.
11567,"Even in this thread, I try to bring up ""what if someone argued this is a problem of there being no minimum wage, instead of a CECA problem"", but it's so polarised like either you love everything the PAP is doing, or you must lump everything together and oppose all of it just because the PAP even mildly touched it once."
11568,"I treat my domestic helpers really well, even better than my parents do."
11569,As far as I know (and I am likely wrong so fact check me) no country has a bilateral VTL or equivalent with either country.
11570,I try to avoid racial comments at work but my lunch group (all Chinese) say the darnest most racist stuff ever.
11571,I try to tell my Singaporeans that I have never witnessed such institutionalized racism before.
11572,"I come from a very politically mixed area in New York State, I’m no stranger to racist attitudes."
11573,I try to use helper more nowadays since I feel like it's a more respectable term than maid.
11574,Ironically my Filipino girlfriend (living in the PH) refers to domestic helpers as maids lol.
11575,We have to respect other races our whole life since birth (if not it's hypocritical if you respect them at age 20 if you were casually racist at age 15) 3.
11576,The foreign worker dorms last year was one of the most apparent example of it.
11577,As a black person here I can safely say we are not treated as badly here as migrant workers are and supporting BLM does not let you off the hook for not addressing the racism faced by them.
11578,"I think that doesn't necessarily gives someone a right to be a xenophobe, sure I agree theyre at fault for not wearing masks but we have to call out such behaviour as there is a rapidly  growing sentiment where all this behaviour against foreigners seem ""ok"", we've always been a country of different cultures and we are a country of immigrants after all, such energy should have been used during voting instead of outright spewing out such harsh remarks, just my two cents"
11579,"Everytime these racist thoughts come, I use this to shut it down until I finally understand that it is really not right to judge a race by the actions of a few because it's wrong and unfair."
11580,"I understand most Singaporeans don't have any idea of the plight of migrant workers, and the sudden riot might have been a shock."
11581,"I understand that In Singapore, if your maid have fun and get pregnant, the family is responsible."
11582,"If we aim to discourage racism in public space, we ought to become more outspoken and persistent in denouncing such public behaviour."
11583,I think though I ended up questioning why my dad was so adamantly against marrying outside of the culture and I concluded I could not tolerate his xenophobia and that is not a world I want my children to be brought up in.
11584,"However, the evidence you brought up to justify the success of Canada's immigration policy does not actually reflect reality."
11585,I believe this article ([https://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/238347-analysis-is-canada-becoming-anti-immigrant](https://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/238347-analysis-is-canada-becoming-anti-immigrant)) may be insightful as it seeks to understand changing societal attitudes towards immigration.
11586,Even immigrants to Canada feel that there are too many immigrants in Canada now.
11587,Look no further than the anti-immigrant sentiment towards Chinese immigrants in Singapore -- despite the fact that Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese.
11588,"however, it is also important to recognise that your comment could likely prevent people of minorities from attempting to talk about racism."
11589,"You may not be racist, but your actions may promote racism."
11590,Avoiding the topic of race contributes to racism.
11591,"I did not say expats are suffering, but that 10K for an expats do not have the same value as for a local, that's it."
11592,"I understand why you see it this way because a minister said it in response to an LGBT isue, but really, things like xenophobia are also western culture wars (eg."
11593,"Even covid and mask wearing was turned into racism against china, anti-communism (?"
11594,"Maybe they have had racist comments yelled at them multiple times, like myself?"
11595,Maybe they're trying to help spread awareness for the plight of others and the existence of systemic racism to their x number of followers?
11596,"Systemic racism and racial oppression, both in the US and at home, will cease to exist when people like you can start seeing the good in people, rather than the bad."
11597,"Based on my experience in an SAP school two decades ago (this is anecdotal and old info), the difference between a Special stream curriculum and an Express stream curriculum is that Citizenship & Character Education (CCE) subject is in the Chinese mother tongue language."
11598,"If the proposal is to offer other mother tongue languages in SAP schools, I am all for it so that students doing other mother tongue languages can study in the schools as well."
11599,"I used Singaporeexpats.com when I moved down here, great team and good service.."
11600,"Living in the US and being on the receiving end of racism opened my eyes to the racism in Singapore, and made me realise how many of the shitty jokes I made in high school were quite hurtful to people of other races."
11601,"To clarify: I consider stuff like ""I don't like Indians like you"" to be racist."
11602,"I do not consider 'microaggressions' like ""wow your English is good"" to be racism at all, because almost all of them are rooted in ignorance of my culture and upbringing, rather than the belief that a certain race is superior, which is the definition of racism."
11603,"I think racism, like theft or dishonesty or whatever negative social behaviour, exists everywhere."
11604,"But as long as the racists don't actually have significant power over you, you're free to just laugh at them and tell them to fuck off."
11605,I used to have this maid whom I remembered asking me if she can have a packet of maggi mee to eat for dinner.
11606,"I grew up with maids throughout childhood until I graduated from poly, and my family has been very kind to all our maids."
11607,"Of course not all maids are good as they may take advantage of the family —- my mum told me that when I was young, this maid we had an affair with my dad..."
11608,So there is reasonable doubt that some employers may take to Ensure their maids don’t do funny business to the family.
11609,But that doesn’t mean the employer takes away basic rights of the maids right.
11610,"\---  “If you want to see the true measure of a man, watch how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”  I would not trust a person who does “good” deeds when he is paid handsomely for it, but abuses the maid when no one is looking."
11611,"I used to think expat packages were a thing of the past until I joined my new company and my boss, only senior manager, lives in Nassim Road."
11612,"The older generation of execs in this country often show apprehension about working with Indian firms, which I dismissed as bunk racism early on in my career."
11613,"I used to think that once my Chinese friends go overseas and experience racism there, they would come back to Singapore and be more conscious of their own racist biases."
11614,"I was raised by a maid and I used to feel bad for them as a child/teen but as an adult now I understand why they do it, and why they stay on."
11615,"So what i do for my maids is to treat them like an adopted part of  the family member, and give them some meaningful life experiences (like going to water park, zoo, cinema , etc) and also some dignity."
11616,I used to use bumble friendship app and met one expat friend whom im no longer in contact with sadly:( could try that app!!
11617,"By that EDMW logic, I am an uncultured filthy expat bastard that wants to ""milk Malaysians"" as much as possible, and that ""I fornicate them [local Malaysians] raw, spray jizz on their faces and they [local Malaysians] can't do anything about it."""
11618,"Regarding salary, as a redditor mentioned here, the salary range has been lowered due to the influx of foreign talents taking up the role (during my time working in the hotel, there has never been a local spa manager)."
11619,We receive around 3 runaway maid cases every week.
11620,There was a maid in heavily soiled clothings dropped off at our office by a cabby.
11621,"According to the driver, he noticed the maid running barefoot along the road and picked her up and sent her to us."
11622,"Back in early nineties, also had a neighbour who was really mean to her maid."
11623,"One afternoon, her maid jumped off the building together with her employer's toddler."
11624,I volunteer at TWC2 an organization that aids foreign workers with their legal rights here in Singapore.
11625,It is my job to know the SG system for maids and how they're treated.
11626,My organization wouldn't exist if maids were being treated fairly by employers.
11627,I translate for the organization to foreign workers.
11628,"I volunteer at a migrant worker aid centre and trust me, death has already come aplenty."
11629,I want to say that I had friends who made racist jokes against me and I would tell them off but they still do it saying it's a joke.
11630,"I want to thank OP and everyone of you in the comment section, for me yes I’m aware because I work in the construction & manufacturing sector, but for the ones who’s far from this industry or not aware of what’s going on in the life of foreign workers, please kindly bring awareness by forward more news and posts like this."
11631,They’re foreign workers but they’re nothing less as human beings  🙏
11632,"The festival holds a deeper message to promote diversity, acceptance when differences among people are being challenged in the world we are in today.~~  ~~Performances by Bert Kreischer (US), Mikey Bustos (PH), Shahar Hason (IL) ,Yohay Sponder (IL) and Kanan Gill (IN).~~  ~~*SOTA Concert Hall and the Kallang Theatre*~~  &nbsp;  ~~9 Sept 2017 | Sat | 9am - 2pm | Free entry~~  ~~Health / Food / Market~~  ~~[HEALTH AND WELLNESS MARKET AT LOEWEN GARDENS](https://expatliving.sg/event/health-wellness-market-loewen-gardens/)~~  ~~Drop by the Health and Wellness Market at Loewen Gardens by Body Temple and The Pantry @ Loewen Gardens."
11633,I wanted to follow this case because it is very telling of how MoM's approach towards quarantining foreign workers is severely lacking but having to read one side of the he said she said with the influencer tacky self obsessed narcissistic background on IG made it very difficult.
11634,"I wanted to make it clear that she was an expat, so she can't be blamed for not knowing the local food court tricks like this."
11635,"Now that I think about it, she had a maid and a baby so she should have been here for a year at least...  ¯\_(◔ ‿ ◔)_/¯"
11636,With the VTL still need quarantine?
11637,"I wanted to try and find work in singapore ,  I have a filipina wife and a lot of negative comments were made about me taking ""jobs"" away fron Singapore citizens and that my wife would be treated like a maid etc Just horrible things."
11638,"I don't think that there is sufficient evidence in the IG posts to indicate that she is a racist, although I do not know if she was a racist before or became a racist over the years."
11639,If the IG posts were about how bitchy she was as a DM and how stifled her GP class is it wouldn't gain any traction but once you pull the racism card suddenly it's news.
11640,It's true that the foreign workers don't complain... they avoid ACE officers completely.
11641,"It is true that the surge is in the foreign worker dorms, but that means it’s very difficult to control."
11642,His racist theory hold up like expired milk.
11643,"&#x200B;  the level of racism is deep, unfortunately."
11644,Essentially a campaign to remove the systemic racism in the property business - it ultimately placed a spotlight on it.
11645,"I was at the rally, they explained why CECA was a bad deal."
11646,Also under CECA they can bring their families and also can apply jobs for their family members.
11647,CECA was a specific target but the rally also targeted mass migration in general.
11648,"But they are not nice people, they are racist, sexist, elitist, they look down on Indians."
11649,"Doing so results in less likelihood of conflicts arising compared to renting to someone with different practices, whether the landlord is racist or not."
11650,I was doing some research today when I discovered that the normally touristy island of St John in fact hosts a detention centre for illegal immigrants but couldn't find any info beyond that.
11651,I was exempted and didnt have to take mother tongue lessons from primary school all the way to JC.
11652,"All in all, I don't think schools are the major factor that causes racism to continue to exist in Singapore."
11653,"**Rather, I think racism stems from bad parenting and lack of upbringing."
11654,"There is no point if the school introduces measures to stem racism, only to have the parents undo all the effort put in by using cheap racially charged ways to verbally discipline their kids or introduce/reinforce stereotypical concepts to their kids."
11655,I was given a choice to take up Hindi at a MOE Language Centre (which I have to travel to after school during the afternoon)or take up Malay/Chinese/Tamil as my mother tongue in school .
11656,He was mentioning how alot of these people are dormitory workers (they are not) and I heard him talk about Indian caste system.
11657,"Nobody dislikes me, but once someone speaks in their mother tongue, the rest of the people will auto change to reply and seem to forget about me."
11658,As I proceed to the doctor's room he shouted that I'm a racist --surprised.pikachu.jpg-- In the end no fight happen he just stared at me as I exit the clinic.
11659,It's mostly because of the political climate and because my origin country (Indonesia) and Singapore was changing the rules for foreign workers.
11660,"I was looking on Scoot for the SG-KL VTL flights, I was wondering if the flight numbers stay the same every month?"
11661,"I was most certainly thinking of (2) in the definition of an ""expat package""."
11662,"The first definition (1)... yeah, I don't think of that as an expat package; seems like standard benefits package in the context of the destination."
11663,"I was on an expat package to London - not a transfer or a long term relocation therefore not adjusted to a London local package, and yes within a single short term ICT visa."
11664,"Now, this is on an attempt to be racist or woke or anything like that."
11665,Do feel free to have a civil discussion here as I would like to here everyone's thoughts and experiences on this mater  **TLDR: Should SG have minimum English requirements for immigrants?
11666,I was once accused of being racist by a colleague because he wanted us to code for him a macro that was impossible to do because of the way his data was arranged.
11667,Obviously the racist fothermucking parents!
11668,"I was right there, there was no smell except for that family reeking of racism."
11669,"Anyway, have you tried volunteering for NGOs that help domestic helpers like Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics(Home)?"
11670,"If you see any maid in distress online, you can refer them to these groups for help."
11671,We talking about how flawed the CMIO model is yet we still making these comments and questioning which side she is from.
11672,It is interesting that you left out the maid gripping the infant's neck for half an hour until she stopping crying.
11673,"So, the problem actually is a kind of vicious cycle that impacts people who are stuck in the rat race and can't care for a child without a maid because there is not alternative, or those who would prefer to not be in the rat race and maybe prefer to work as a carpenter or a childcare worker because there is no opportunity because the wages are too low."
11674,"In any case, who does the import maid and construction workforce favour?"
11675,"He always says that the sole reason you see foreigners in his role is because construction firms want to pay less (and by less, I mean more than half of his salary) and he has a lot of local friends in the field, who can’t find a job because all these foreign workers are willing to be paid like $1-1.5k instead of $3-4k."
11676,"I was saying that the 48% is likely more accurately 84%, based on the encounters I've had with FDW-""employing"" Singaporeans."
11677,I know one FDW who is still paid $450 a month with one day off a month — the same package she had when she came here 15+ years ago.
11678,I was shocked by the casual racism towards Indians in singapore when I was on exchange there
11679,Includes a maid once a week who cleans.
11680,I saw on the Ministry of Manpower I need a salary of $3900 a month and that my employer has to sort out the employment pass.
11681,"During the afternoon before Muhyiddin's first announcement, there was rumors about an impending lockdown (proved true) & some form of interstate travel ban (later finetuned as travel restriction, but not before they declared food supply to be exempted from their movement control order)."
11682,I just googled and got this:   https://www.helperchoice.com/c/maid/job-duties
11683,"I was told that the new maid that was assigned to the household for training/trial, had a super negative experience."
11684,"I was very young back then, probably in my primary school days so I couldn't remember much about the maid."
11685,"Regarding the affair with the maid, she told me he denied the claim though, but knowing my mum she wouldn't want to joke about such things."
11686,But then again when it comes to such things it's easy to put the blame on the maid because they're just outsiders right?
11687,"Thus after learning what happened to my family (and other horrible stories involving maids), I can sort of understand why some employers do not want to blur the lines so much between employer-maid relationship."
11688,I was warned by our expat friend about Pizza and Nachos... could it be a lack of good cheese?
11689,"I was willing to engage in discussion until 1) you claimed that the current backlash against immigrants in Europe can be statically supported, and 2) compared the state controlled media here to that of North Korea."
11690,"Some fun reads - http://iwasanexpatwife.com/2011/02/27/become-an-ugly-expat-in-12-easy-steps/  Or this particular excerpt from https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/singapore-isnt-boring-you-are-b9ef744a887e I don't with agree with everything he says, but I've definitely come across similar views about why Singapore is boring."
11691,"The racism and elitism is so embedded in our society, you'd think this was a fascist society or something."
11692,"I wasn't denying racism, the point you quoted was dealing specifically with the idea of inciting *hostility*."
11693,"But just to address the idea that everyone is racist, and somehow that's ok- there's a fundamental difference in effect between remarks against a group with more societal power and one with less."
11694,"Even if someone makes a racist remark/stereotypes/mocks a majority, the effect is negligible in comparison to the effect on a minority."
11695,I'm just saying that OP's claim about being indian themselves does not actually excuse any racist behavior they may act out.
11696,I can be a chinese and still be a racist towards my fellow chinese.
11697,I never implied OP was a racist and it would be good if you could read my comment properly before downvoting me lol
11698,I wasn't talking about treating maids like slaves.
11699,Victorian cultures had live in maids.
11700,"The only reason Singaporean ""culture"" has indentured servitude today is because there are economically less developed countries that offer a steady stream of maids."
11701,"Once maids become more expensive because those countries have higher standards of living you'll naturally see Singaporean ""culture"" evolve."
11702,"I watched a couple of matches at Holland Village with my pal, there's a large expat community there (read: English people) so if everything goes right and it's indeed coming home, the atmosphere should be buzzing, especially at the British Indian Curry House."
11703,"But looking around my younger cousins, i dont feel that people today are too concerned about losing their mother tongue (mandarin specifically)."
11704,Hence that's why he could logically identify that the examples he raised of systemic social racism isn't born out of historical and institutional domination but of social and personal prejudices.
11705,"A similar topic came up recently regarding racism & SAP schools, and I really enjoyed [this Rice Media article](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-sap-schools-chinese-elitism-singapore/) on the topic."
11706,"Being receptive to criticism is really hard, and some people struggle with suddenly being told that they're racist/sexist/elitist etc."
11707,And yeah I said older generation people but it's no surprise there's many gen Z kids who are still racist with the way people are..
11708,I went to Turkey earlier this month non VTL.
11709,Nothing about it is special except the passive racism and ignorance it breeds.
11710,"I went to a normal neighborhood primary school and then to a SAP secondary school, and I can attest that the racism I observed was much stronger in my primary school with students from different races."
11711,"I also remember there were a few Indian boys who occasionally shared racist jokes about their own race in a self-deprecating manner, and the other classmates just laughed about it together."
11712,"I don't remember any racist incidents from my SAP secondary school, and I agree it's for the reasons you mentioned."
11713,"She better be careful, her doubling down on racism has really triggered the mob."
11714,Always thought it strange they took Malay as mother tongue and not Mandarin.
11715,I went to this expat's house to make a delivery and they way they treated their helper was outrageous
11716,"Rather than actually taking a personal look at how racism has been embedded in their own upbringing, the writer chooses to make a bad segue to a government anti terrorism ad."
11717,"You would bet your ass off that the Singapore government will be really fucking happy to get educated Indian/SEA/Chinese/European expats to come to Singapore and become its citizens, improving the human resource in Singapore."
11718,I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2023-03-17 03:34:30 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2023-03-17%2003:34:30%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/tfizw6/singapores_expat_numbers_slump_to_lowest_level/i0z4n6b/?context=3)  [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fsingapore%2Fcomments%2Ftfizw6%2Fsingapores_expat_numbers_slump_to_lowest_level%2Fi0z4n6b%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202023-03-17%2003%3A34%3A30%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.
11719,I will be messaging you in 3 months on [**2021-09-18 16:24:33 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-09-18%2016:24:33%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o2h25f/expats_in_singapore_hong_kong_watch_with_envy_as/h284e5q/?context=3)  [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fsingapore%2Fcomments%2Fo2h25f%2Fexpats_in_singapore_hong_kong_watch_with_envy_as%2Fh284e5q%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-09-18%2016%3A24%3A33%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.
11720,"Regarding maids, you can hire someone to come clean a couple of times a week, and the cost is probably comparable to hiring a maid in the US."
11721,"You can also hire a live in maid, and her pay would be something on the order of $500-$800 SGD per month depending on experience."
11722,I will correct myself and say that the FDW or former FDW must seek permission from MOM to marry a Singapore citizen or PR.
11723,Apparently there’s a higher chance if the FDW goes back to her home country for at least 2 years before being married.
11724,"Some anecdotes here: https://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=27290  Of course, it’s also possible that the FDW managed to change her identity and married under a different name and passport."
11725,"However, the clause in the legal text 9.7 states that they have to explain why they turn aside people who are covered by CECA, and if it's not within the framework of CECA or within the rules they can't."
11726,This is why India has threatened to sue Singapore for violating CECA on several occasions when Singapore says they are tightening their immigration quota  [https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-decries-ceca-violation-by-singapore-113021700123\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-decries-ceca-violation-by-singapore-113021700123_1.html)  You can read it from India's viewpoint in the article above.
11727,I think foreign workers can be transported in tonners too.
11728,The trucks that foreign workers actually ride in look like a fucking tin can compared to a tonner.
11729,"When I go out to eat at restaurants, my maid join us and eat together, I am happy, but it’s also because I can afford it."
11730,What does it matter even if SMEs don’t intend for any foreign workers to get hurt?
11731,"Over time, due to practised apathy and not really caring or ""realising"" that there is any attempt to be racist towards me, I gradually have less and less opinions to contribute in racism discussions."
11732,There is simply no time...no time for racist thoughts to even enter the equation.
11733,Assaulting your maid is unacceptable.
11734,"The opposition would have one bloc, and no one to spew anti CECA rhetoric to give the opposition a bad name."
11735,Yknow what the migrant workers would be touched by?
11736,It's infinitely harder to contain that and you know for sure there'll be hell to pay in some corners of the community if/when locals end up getting infected from a migrant worker.
11737,These foreign workers are often our colleagues and friends too.
11738,"I won't deny my role in the downward spiral but let's not use that as a way of downplaying the facts on how terribly backwards Germany is and the tremendous amount of propaganda depicting it as otherwise (clean, organized, welcomes immigrants/refugees, innovative, etc) since that's (ad hominem) typically the first line of defense that I see them use whenever someone starts spewing truths about their country."
11739,"I too came on VTL, and my father, whom I told tails of how Changi is the best airport in the world, was thoroughly disappointed."
11740,"I know people who make racist jokes all the time, but there they are on insta preaching BLM like they own it."
11741,"Its because the very same people who preach it are equally at fault for it or are doing nothing active in their lives to curb racism, and that's not going to change because of a couple of inspirational insta or tweets about BLM."
11742,"I hate this discrimination as much as you, but instead of posting it on insta where i would reach an audience incapable of solving this issue, i will do my best to rid racism in my day to day life and advocate for it, because that would mean much more to the affected parties than my insta story with no weight can do."
11743,"And never say that people are powerless to make a change, racism is everywhere even in SG, and we all can do something to stop it, its just that there are people who choose to resign to not doing anything about it."
11744,It is not only those on expat packages who bring their families over.
11745,"I wonder how he got his nutrition, especially after the issue of migrant worker treatment came to light last year."
11746,I wonder how many of these foreign workers took their own lives and went unreported..
11747,I wonder how the racism apologists are going to spin this one.
11748,I wonder if the domestic worker is employed by someone on the condo committee.
11749,"I wonder if the law states that tenants must pay extra if they cook, if they use incense, if they have pets, if they have children, and must perform deep cleaning of the house before vacating or the tenants will be jailed, would that help make things more equal and prevent racism, sexism and etc."
11750,I wonder if this VTL means that Switzerland will recognize the Singapore vaccination certificate as is.
11751,I wonder if those with existing VTL ticket can still change their return flight to another day?
11752,I wonder if we do the foreign workers job how much bto price would skyrocket.
11753,"Aren't they afraid that the maid will snap, and say, poison their food?"
11754,"Just wanna feel better about yourself by bashing against expats, and all of them categorically?"
11755,According to the law maids are below dogs apparently.
11756,I wonder what this would mean for people who later on need to reschedule their flight or whose VTL flight was cancelled by the airlines for one reason or another… Does it mean they would have no choice but to try to come back via non-VTL flight?
11757,The maid will be deported and banned from entering sg?
11758,Why not interview the maid who went down?
11759,I wonder would this have happened if that situation with the dormitory workers dint surface lol
11760,The stories my mum has shared from what she’s seen at supermarkets and taxi stands makes me so disappointed that people my generation would be so openly racist
11761,I won’t be surprised if this is related to the rampant domestic worker abuse in Singapore.
11762,I work PT at a restaurant and sometimes I see families getting a separate table for their maid.
11763,The maid only gets some plain rice while the families feasts.
11764,"It's like treating your maid like your dog, or worse."
11765,"They yell, scold and even get into racist rants."
11766,Doubt you’ll be able to find a job as an expat as a fresh grad
11767,"And if any one wants to accuse me of being racist, im indian too, so kindly fuck off."
11768,"I once heard a person say ""Oh, the maid already ate at home""."
11769,"In fact, given how strict the government is on work passes nowadays, I would say entry level employment passes might not be so easy to obtain."
11770,What really annoys me is when expats look down on Singapore.
11771,I work with some expats.
11772,There is absolutely no racism in Toronto.
11773,I’m sorry but do we really need to pay an expatriate salary for IT support?
11774,"This post hits me hard because even as a Chinese guy, it wouldn't be racism hitting you in the balls, but sadism, clique-ish behavior from your colleagues to bosses and also just trigger-happy shouting and yelling for..... the sake of it."
11775,I would agree that it's actually far more sensible for expats and immigrants to make noise and hope that there are enough people to take up their cause for the system to be recognised as flawed so the government will change it.
11776,"I would agree with you, if you said racism is widespread."
11777,That's not the same as systemic racism.
11778,Systemic racism is much much harder to root out.
11779,"For an example of actual systemic racism, I refer you to the Jim Crow laws in the US."
11780,I did not say to make the dormitory operation to cough up cash now.
11781,"That’s what I’ve seen over the last 6-7 months at least when I see termination notices going out, not just to expats but also to locals."
11782,"The point is that expats being let go isn’t because of xenophobia, no matter how much people would like to try and paint it that way."
11783,"As for the last para, if you read some of the articles that are being posted, you would also think that expats are of the view every Singaporean is out to get them, when that’s patently untrue."
11784,I would be livid but I won't call them racist.
11785,"To me, what is really racism is when it is institutionalised (like malaysia) or blatantly ignored (repeated police brutality in the US), even justified by the law (rohingyas)."
11786,I would cite the [Wedding Toast Comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nxfb7z/celebrity_wedding_in_singapore_circa_2021/) as an example of reverse racism on this sub.
11787,But this is clearly a racist act.
11788,I would have been allowed to quarantine at home if I took a non-VTL flight (and a few of my friends did that.....they were not willing to spend 10K on flights for a family).
11789,I sprung for the VTL because I had to get back to work.
11790,The cost of having kids in Singapore as an expat is crazy expansive compared to almost all EU countries (I would almost say all but don’t know first hand :)) one year of mid level international school is roughly 40k and more if your child needs support.
11791,"Just because we don't interact with foreign workers, doesn't mean government is not responsible for them."
11792,"Recently, my cousin took his flat back from an expat from a particular country and the walls of the house was drawn by their kids and the expats refused to clean it."
11793,"I would like to add this [info](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/measures-to-contain-the-covid-19-outbreak-in-migrant-worker-dormitories) from 14 Dec 2020 saying how 98,289 dormitory workers tested S+ meaning they had the virus but were not tested C+ due to various reasons (old infection that was not detected due to asymptomatic case, low viral load, etc)   Adding this you will push the death rate even lower."
11794,"** Call me a racist if you want, but I did give them two chances and got burnt."
11795,"Not that racism doesn’t exist, I just feel that you are just echoing stuff you read on social media and passing it off to sound smart in discussions."
11796,"What were the assumptions (in terms of benefits) behind CECA ""itself""; and to what extent is it achieving its goals?"
11797,I would like to point out that it's the person that is racist and not the race.
11798,It does not mean that this racist person is a Chinese means that everyone is and vice versa.
11799,1) Are the PAP responsible for the high infection rates amongst dormitory workers?
11800,"2) If there are long-term healthcare requirements for anyone who suffers from covid-19, what will the outcome be for dormitory workers?"
11801,"With regards to foreign workers, I do agree that the government have to do more and they could easily increase birth rates with more grants and help through financial means to the people."
11802,when the main point should have been to hold these individuals accountable Everyone needs to play their part thats what they said and when some didnt and others pointed this out....they tryna make this about xenophobia.
11803,But buying a condo for 1M is not very appealing even as an expat.
11804,"I completely agree with you in that the US-brand of racism against black people should not be conflated with the conversations we have about racism here, or worldwide."
11805,"As [this Substack](https://tuition.substack.com/p/9-black-lives-matter-in-singapore) puts it, racism is a global structure that affects everyone!"
11806,I would say 48% WANTS maid to be paid way less than 600.
11807,I would say expats should also ditch SG in terms of tourism.
11808,You could go to KL or any other cities in SEA with migrant workers and test them and I bet a large sum of them have COVID.
11809,I would say that for a generation that has gone through worst hardships than these foreign workers.
11810,I would say that racism towards Indians in Singapore is less apparent than in the UK.
11811,"In Singapore, elitism is much more apparent than racism."
11812,Most of the dissatisfaction comes from the perceived number of Indians immigrants from India competing with the locals for jobs that earn above the median wage.
11813,"Most of these immigrants, together with dark-skinned migrant workers, are not perceived as elites in Singapore."
11814,"Even for maids and manual labor, I have seen some quitting for better opportunities and I applaud their courage."
11815,"Like for eg if someone says they won’t date Chinese guys at all because they are all alcoholics, gamblers, womanisers, then yes that person is racist."
11816,"I don't know about you, but for me there's a line that separates acceptable behavior from racist."
11817,"Over there, they are slamming the government for using their taxpayer dollars to give foreigners free vaccine and complaining about how the government treat foreign talents better than locals"
11818,"It actually sometimes feels like the opposite situation for Malays / Indians and how people are racist at them, with Malays it's all 'omg you all are poor and have tons of kids and do drugs and are useless and don't have proper jobs BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ACCEPTABLE AS PEOPLE' and with Indians it's more 'oh are you in banking or finance or something!!"
11819,I wouldn't call it nitpicking or racism luh.
11820,"What should the supervisor do, ignore their duties to correct the racist?"
11821,Pin the racist down on the floor and get the Malay nurse to forcibly conduct the vaccination?
11822,"If one of the other patients overheard the conversation and has time to engage the racist, sure."
11823,"But if the racist refuses to listen, there's nothing else you can do."
11824,I wouldn't mind VTLs so much if we had domestic restrictions similar to the places these tourists are coming from.
11825,I wouldn't want to do any procedure on anyone who has displayed racism to me.
11826,I wouldnt really call it racist.
11827,"Social impact: My dad has turned a lot more racist since starting this habit, and is influencing my mum."
11828,Theres some outright xenophobia and racism in some things that people say that you waste time and energy confronting that.
11829,"I wrote a post on this before, but basically a big chunk of our migrant workers (the largest group) are from Bangladesh, but the number of PMETs from Bangladesh in Singapore is very very small (not sure what CECA is but pretty sure there is no such agreement between Bangladesh & Singapore)."
11830,"One of the other groups of migrant workers are Indians, but they have a huge PMET population here."
11831,"I wrote about this here: http://spuddings.net/2012/10/08/everyday-racism/  In a way I think that some of the backlash was just about allowing people to feel good about themselves, and feel like they're so completely un-racist."
11832,"Although we don't talk about race, we're constantly reminded of racial lines and differences, and it's made us all a little bit racist, with many misconceptions, prejudices and subtle discrimination all over the place."
11833,"I wrote in to my MP and the MOH, discussing the arrival testing overload at the airport and the overall inefficiencies of the VTL system."
11834,"The response I got from the MOH is: ""For travel, ultimately, there should be not VTL countries or VTL flights, just vaccinated travellers, who need not serve SHN."
11835,"Do you think, given how the owners has already treated the maids, that sleeping outside was a decision made with the maids's well-being in mind?"
11836,"Interesting how she had a friend who was also rich enough to afford to rent out her place to migrant workers, and then leave it unoccupied for two years,"
11837,"Before going there, is it a very niche area where the expat can add significant value?"
11838,"Suddenly an expat comes and almost all the front line leadership to mid level leadership are taken by UK, AU & US."
11839,Is it because we made it much easier to get expats here?
11840,"There are maids from foreign countries but they're mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia, but they have to quarantine for 21 days."
11841,pretty sure it's not fun to live as a minority immigrant in another country.
11842,"It is comfortable amongst the relatively secular PAP elite - CMIOization in Singapore is decades in the future, Malay Islamic insurgence likewise waiting for the Iranian revolution."
11843,I'd say it's like a classism infused with racism.
11844,buying food for the maid and checking up on her more often.
11845,"I'd say that I'm lucky to have quite a lot of personal interactions with many expats from various countries, currently living in Singapore."
11846,"I'd strongly recommend [this piece](https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-grappling-isolation-migrant-workers-dorms-long-return-wider-community) that TODAY wrote, it was also posted on this sub  It's just painful to read this:  >With the migrant workers largely confined to their dormitories, those interviewed by TODAY said they have been going through the same mundane routine of heading straight to their work sites each morning and returning to their living quarters in the evening."
11847,"I cannot begin to imagine how mentally strong these migrant workers are: to leave their homes, work in a country that has historically paid little heed to their welfare, and now essentially 'locked up' and caught in an endless loop of being at work and in their dormitories."
11848,"lifts the current P2HA measures (IMO, an overreaction) for the general population, it will apply too for our migrant workers and without delay."
11849,"I too want to try and get comfortable with the local culture and adapt as much as possible, rather than living like an expat, but it has been hard."
11850,Not because I want to spend all my time with expats.. but because everyone else assumes I do.
11851,"I blame this more on the expats here than the locals, who in large part do keep to themselves."
11852,"I'd wager that they learn to be ""scum"" once they're here; several recently-arrived (<10 years or so) Indian immigrants of my acquaintance are similarly shocked/enraged."
11853,I'll agree that racism is less of an issue.
11854,"But on second thoughts, I'll agree with you, Singapore is probably not as bad as Europe in terms of racism."
11855,"The definition of racism is already based around the intention of the person acting, so how the recipient feels isn't part of the determining factor."
11856,And *feeling* like it was racism isn't in any way proof of racism.
11857,"Based on my own fundamental understanding and education, I perceive that there is a double standard in treatment of foreign workers, especially in a certain S.A.P."
11858,"school which I attend currently-   I am educated on how important and significant that the Samsui Women has in the early days in the construction of Singapore and how we should appreciate their efforts to building the Singapore of today, yet our current construction force are foreign workers who are predominantly Indian, yet I perceive that not only is there a lack of appreciation for such workers, but also an active discrimination in regards to their race (referring to them as Bangladeshis) and using them as a banner for mockery."
11859,>The maids of many families never get off days.
11860,"> Well, you paid for a small space for the maid to sleep."
11861,">I do not understand why many people continue to be racist towards them, and always shun them away like plague."
11862,I for one don't care whether they are a construction worker or a normal singaporean person and have NEVER seen any stereotype arrogant Singaporean deriding a foreign worker in any manner.
11863,>I find that we are no different from Qatar when it comes to the treatment of foreign workers in Singapore.
11864,"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/feb/26/qatar-foreign-workers-slave-conditions  SG has improved in the treatment of maids and foreign workers, in my opinion."
11865,"Of course, if you come from the point of ""we wouldn't know how employers are treating their maids in their own homes"", then we have no room for discussion because we would NEVER know."
11866,"Unless you're a social worker or go to a good sample size of houses to check out their maid's living quarters, I don't really think a person can claim to ""know"" what is going on in the industry."
11867,some articles below about better treatment of foreign workers with living conditions improving/wages increasing.
11868,">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/fun-and-games-part-of-the-package-at-workers-dorm  >http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/more-help-and-treats-for-foreign-workers  >http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/bosses-must-now-pay-filipino-maids-at-least-550-a-month  If you want to talk about ""slavery"", lets talk about National Service shall we."
11869,"Do maids get arrested if they say ""no""?"
11870,"Nearly all your arguments along the lines of ""THEY WORK SO HARD, WHY CAN'T THEY GET A DAY OFF, UNREPORTED TEKANS OR INJURIES, TERRIBLE LIVING CONDITIONS, LOW PAY"" are just as pertinent to National service  (maybe even more so) as the foreign worker problem."
11871,"Naturally, since it was my choice to integrate to Singapore, I do not have an expat package."
11872,I'll just say that if restrictions are too onerous the nation will suffer brain drain from both local-born talent and foreign talent.
11873,"In this case, there is a clear divide between people who think that the incident was racist, and those who do not."
11874,"Those who did not think that it was racist were met with comments like ""eh fuck you lah can listen to minority voices more"" ""you from SAP school isit"" ""next time you burn joss papers I go kick you see how""  I get that we will never understand how a minority would feel or perceive things."
11875,They're here to seek validation for their existing biases against minorities and immigrants.
11876,Appealing to their conscience is like politely asking a xenophobe to kindly refrain from spreading xenophobia please.
11877,People are not being xenophobic or racist for the sake of being xenophobic or racist.
11878,Is that racist?
11879,Are we going to stick with a defined meaning of racist or just chuck everything we dislike done by another race as racist?
11880,But how is this racist?
11881,"The justifications provided by NGOs have always been on the basis of emotional appeals, regarding how migrant workers have came from far away to work on our infrastructures and other essential services, and they argue that in itself means they deserve better housing."
11882,Can I really call this racism?
11883,I can say that the silhouette is close between raya and the wedding outfit but this is hardly racist.
11884,Should I call you racist here as well?
11885,But is the person racist on purpose?
11886,Is the person racist?!
11887,Am I racist to myself?
11888,"Most people treat their domestic workers with respect, and as a normal human."
11889,"I expect employers to treat their workers with respect and dignity befitting a human, and similarly, domestic workers should be treated the same way."
11890,"When I said you should call the police to report any maid abuse, you respond by saying ""So ultimately you are saying domestic workers do not need to be treated any better as they are now isn't it?"""
11891,"Unlike you, I treat coworkers and maids with respect and as a dignified human, while you ""treats them as nothing more than a second class worker""."
11892,She didn't say anything about how difficult it is to fire the maid.
11893,Rousing public hate towards her maid?
11894,"If she encounters a thief that isn't her maid, the solution is to call the police."
11895,"I'll try, I definitely met some friendly people here but also have experienced my fair share of casual racism."
11896,"(I've also checked the expat guide, gumtree, Facebook groups and so on)"
11897,"You mention the racism and prejudice in your local community, here in SG."
11898,I'm Australian but know Singapore pretty well... And even I saw this as fake/exaggerated and really frigging racist.
11899,However Mandarin is my mother tongue and that pushes me towards the Chinese side.
11900,"I wish the Chinese could educate their children on racism and thwart the stereotypes from breeding, I have met many people from the minorities that are really very nice and very helpful."
11901,"I'm Chinese, I'll gladly admit today that I definitely don't face as much racism as my minority friends."
11902,I also will continue to do my part to call out racist behaviors and not partake in any racist behaviors.
11903,"But, if I keep getting generalized as a racist person just because some racist person shares my ethnicity you'll lose me as an ally."
11904,I don't deal with racist incidents or have my nationality questioned based on the color of skin with nearly the same frequency.
11905,"Edit2: for future nomad expats who stumble upon this topic with the same question, the answer seems to be 30 to 89 days."
11906,"I'm Indian (I was born in India, I moved here when I was 6) and so many years of mixing around with locals has more or less desensitized me to the casual racism that can be seen on the daily."
11907,"What I find so different between Singapore and the US is that in the US, there is a large fraction of people who acknowledge that racism exists and are working hard to make things better."
11908,"In Singapore, no one is supposed to talk about racism."
11909,"Rather than acknowledging the problem and working hard towards solving it, the government comes up with 1) actively racist policies like race-based immigration quotas designed to preserve the racial majority (so much for ""meritocracy"") and 2) ineffective and lame policies like rotating the race of the president."
11910,"When racism is baked into the country from the top down, it becomes acceptable."
11911,"When you observe racism in Singapore but no one talks about it, you start to question your own observations ""Maybe they aren't racist and maybe I'm the weird one for thinking they're racist""."
11912,"I'm Indian and 29 this year, though I don't think racism right now is as bad as it used to be, let me share with you guys a short story of mine."
11913,"Back in the early 2000's when I was a kid, racism really affected me as I realised even when the bus was full, noone wanted to sit beside me."
11914,"Such passive racism really made me sad, and often I felt like I was some kind of disease."
11915,There was of course aggressive racism too that I faced in school.
11916,"I feel racism has come a long way, and comparing my story to the current times shows that we are improving."
11917,"To the OP and all redditers here, when I was young noone stood up for me when racism was prevalent, if you can, do help be vocal against racism."
11918,Growing up I just brushed these remarks off cuz I took them as compliments but looking back it's pretty damn racist.
11919,"Speaking of racist parents, I have this friend (Chinese) whose mother is ""racist towards Malays"" but was fine with me hanging out with him at his place."
11920,"No one is born racist, everything stems from parenting."
11921,"A lot of parents/grandparents from all races are racist, and we really can't change anything about that because they grew up with that ""stay away from apuneh"" or ""don't let the Malay steal your money"", etc mentality."
11922,I don't understand why these incidents with racists are getting more and more common now.
11923,"I can't speak for other European countries, but in Scandinavia there is a huge cultural stigma against maids."
11924,I'm OK with candidates not being good at mother tongue and don't need them to all come and show off their dialect during election but I'm more concerned with our entire next generation bad at mother tongue.
11925,"I'm very dark skinned and yes of course there is racism here, but there's also racism in every corner of the world as long as you're the minority."
11926,"With the pandemic came travel restrictions and remote work, and being stuck here for almost two years straight now has made me realize how important the ability to travel domestically is."
11927,"Whether or not Singapore should welcome foreigners, I think Singaporeans, collectively, have no right to be racist and xenophobic against legal foreign workers and immigrants, if collectively, they do nothing politically, at least as voters, to stop the immigration policies that allow the immigration they so hate."
11928,I'm White and went to Sydney ages ago and experienced racist shit from a lot of Asian women in particular at this event I was attending and they were in your face about it all casual like.
11929,"I want to say again that I'm definitely more excited than worried about this opportunity, and don't think of Singapore as a racist or xenophobic country."
11930,Hopefully it's a minority that are racist against us
11931,"I'm a German and definitely not earning ""expat pay""."
11932,"These two factors, I believe, contributes to why my acquaintances and friends would dare to spew full-blown racist rants in front of me."
11933,I used to have a colleague who would directly tell me degrading racist jokes pertaining to my race.
11934,"Do what you want as long as it's not blatantly racist like ""Malays are [insert degrading noun]""."
11935,"To them, I can only say stay strong and I stand with you against racism"
11936,"Because I moved back largely for family reasons, I can also empathise with those expats for whom repatriating made sense, but I'm not getting that from your post."
11937,No racism or bias.
11938,I miss the food and family however... i can totally understand why most expats would choose to leave Singapore.
11939,"Domestic help is not a thing, people don't have maids here and it would cost too much anyway."
11940,Your best bet is to live downtown (that's where all the expats live anyway) and use public transportation.
11941,"Since then it's been a combination of family and domestic helpers who've helped to keep him well and happy; however, recent circumstances have made this difficult, and my father is reluctant to remain his sole caretaker."

11945,These racist bastards deserve a taste of their own medicine
11946,"But not because I've been subjected to mild and casual racism intermittently in my life here, from a bunch of ignoramuses."
11947,I honestly don't see how such harmless curiosity can be construed as racism.
11948,No expat I know who is working here will have a problem making these criteria if the company has a good and capable HR.
11949,I'm a foreigner from USA living in SG and HATE being called an expat for this exact reason.
11950,"I'm a foreigner studying in SG, I have been granted mother tongue exemption by MOE."

11957,I'm a so-called foreign talent (from Europe) and relocated here some years ago.

12011,"cultural reasons, quality of life, easier to hire domestic maids...etc)."
12012,It seems to me that the best way to go about it is for me to apply for jobs in Singapore and somehow get an employment pass and later try to translate that over to Permanent Residency?
12013,I strongly disagree to the notion that it is considered racist as long as the minority say its  racist.
12014,"Because, then, anything can be racist and the minority begins to view the majority as racist just because we are part of the majority."
12015,Don't label everything as racist just cos it fits your narrative.
12016,I used to not speak Chinese to hide my accent too but I realised it may just be giving in to the xenophobia.
12017,"I still code switch when speaking with non-immigrant friends and NS buddies but as I grew older I realise that if people like us (who are in a much better position to engage in this conversation) don't push back, then who's gonna help push back on the xenophobia?"
12018,It's really on us to push back against the xenophobic rhetoric whenever possible.
12019,Most of us don't personally know a migrant worker so it's easy to completely ignore their situation because it isn't something deeply personal.
12020,We're a supposedly first world country and the way we're treating the migrant workers who have contributed so much to Singapore is fucking embarrassing.
12021,"I didn't witness any overt racism from students towards each other, though you could definitely sense that students of Indian and Malay descent were slightly more isolated."
12022,"In UK culture, dressing up as another culture is considered very sketchy and easily can be considered racist if not done with a lot of sensitivity."
12023,"The tension I observed mostly strongly is something others have mentioned here - racism towards SG nationalities is somewhat taboo, but racism towards foreign nationals, especially Filipinos and South Asians, is normalised."
12024,"In my opinion, they are one and the same - racism is racism wherever you call home."
12025,"I think there is a lot of denial in SG about ""acceptable racism"" and that it's ok as long as you don't do it against native SGers."
12026,"We seem to be the only ang mohs in the block, which I like - we live in Singapore because we absolutely love Singapore, not because we want to spend our time in a weird expat enclave."
12027,"I'm fully aware of that - people land here, see the readily available maid population and join in."
12028,"In the UK, you couldn't hire a maid without paying them minimum wage in any case."
12029,"Not sure whether you have a limit on hours (I believe the UK opted out of the EU working time directive), but if that is in force then there's a maximum number of hours a maid could work in a week anyway."
12030,"Some (very wealthy) people will hire an au pair (fancy word for maid - typically a student) but the conditions are vastly different to the conditions a maid has here - most would get their own room with a bed and privacy, minimum wage (probably more) and significantly fewer hours of work."
12031,"Most people don't ""need"" a maid, therefore the option isn't something the electorate clamour for."
12032,The demand for that section of maids is therefore less.
12033,"third interpretation  >Economic efficiency, wealth, and standards of living should be synonymous with the satisfaction of the people  * we should take economic efficiency as the ultimate indicator of satisfaction, thus even if people are against a policy for whatever other reasons (racism, xenophobia, tribalism etc."
12034,"&#x200B;  finally finally this is more of an extra point,  >How does that compare to Black people or immigrants?"
12035,Do you think immigrants and Black people are the equivalent of dogs?
12036,It was a huge racist bait so now we can see these racists for who they really are so they could be shamed publicly.
12037,I'm glad that someone has finally brought up FDW rights.
12038,There has been a lot of talk lately about migrant workers' rights (and rightly so) but very little about the mistreatment of FDWs.
12039,Now is the time to consider the inherent racism and sexism involved in the laws and (lack of) protections offered to these women.
12040,as more racist-related incident happened there's social media to keep people aware and cautious about being a clown.
12041,"I'm going to address your links in a bit but those are still better than this: https://www.visakanv.com/sg/examples-of-racism/  >“One evening, I drove to Little India and it was pitch dark but not because there was no light, but because there were too many Indians around.”   Imagine fucking elected official saying this on national TV."
12042,>https://www.dailysabah.com/world/islamophobia/switzerland-holds-islamophobic-referendum-on-banning-face-veils/   Not racist one bit.
12043,>https://namastesolotravel.com/2019/01/31/racism-in-switzerland-experience-brown-traveller/  This is absolutely unacceptable.
12044,>https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2019/07/25/swiss-hotel-issues-racist-info-sheet-for-indian-tourists-apologises.html  More cultural than racial.
12045,Heck I even found a link that goes into all the racism prevalent in Singapore:
12046,"There's nothing that surprising about seeing xenophobic and nativist posts on this sub because this sub isn't the ""liberal echo chamber"" people think it is."
12047,I'm going to point you to [this comment which brings up the 2011 example of a PAP minister who suggested creating better facilities for foreign workers](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ip9s9g/singapores_poorest_stay_in_lockdown_while_others/g4j80q8/).
12048,"His seat ent to Workers' Party in 2011 (who ""reminded Serangoon Gardens voters that they did not want a foreign worker dormitory to be built in their back yard."")"
12049,"Having been alive in 2011, I also remember that the government had been moving towards being a bit more sympathetic towards foreign workers - including suggesting that a [mandatory day off be given to foreign domestic helpers](https://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111021-306333.html)."
12050,Naturally [some Singaporeans](https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-06-23/one-day-maids-too-much-singapore) were [not happy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/08/singapore-domestic-workers-rights).
12051,In short: there is a subset of Singaporeans who will not care about the plight of foreign workers.
12052,They will resist any suggestions to improve the plight of the foreign workers.
12053,"I'm gonna say this, though I do agree how we treat maids isn't the best thing ever, we are no where close to slavery or anything quite."
12054,"First off they aren't forced against their will to work for us, they have options to quit or move, there at extensive interviews before hand so the maid knows what she is in for when it comes to taking care of the family and so on."
12055,Not being racist but the area op is describing seems to fit Bedok South.
12056,"I'm guessing it's more like previously, the only ones who would get posted out to work in another country are the higher level employees/expats."
12057,"However now it seems like more people are willing to leave their homes, move to new countries and find jobs by themselves, which means they don't get all the cushy expat benefits but also their job level may not be as high as previously because they're the ones who want to move not the company wants them to move."
12058,I can't imagine with all the visitors from around the world being stuffed into a few VTL flights in a short time span would work out quite well.
12059,It's very obvious he's a racist from early on.
12060,"And sadly, the same level of courage it takes to call out these casual racism by the victim is not needed by the perpetrators to spew in in your face."
12061,"I guess my only choice is to cut ties and put her in a nursing home, or find a maid to replace my care giving?"
12062,"However my mother has expressly rejected having a maid countless times, claiming she will abuse the maid."
12063,I was reading up on the training employment pass and one of the requirements was that the training be part of my program.
12064,I'm in favor of banning FDW.
12065,But this was a case of them paying me more because I was the only person they could find who could do the job... not because I was an expat.
12066,"I'm in the first year of a Human Geography bachelor, and I want to research the amount of conflict between 'foreign talent' and 'foreign workers' in Singapore, but I'm not sure how I should operationalize this."
12067,"I'm in the teaching industry and ""expat"" packages are very common here."
12068,"""domestic worker making an exchange = can't really make trouble for me"" vs ""guy in suit making an exchange = better say yes in case he wants to speak to my supervisor""."
12069,"I feel like the racism is too prevalent, I've travelled all over and I've never experience any explicit racism other than Singapore."
12070,"And if I was ever subjected to racism in the US,UK or Philippines I know I would have 10 locals to back me up."
12071,"But in Singapore somehow racism is understandable because of the ""situation""."
12072,"I feel like getting angrier to, I don't want to become negative living here, I'm an optimist all about world peace, that is my biggest worry, that I become racist too."
12073,"just saying, people will look at your skin colour and you will see hints of racism."
12074,(Ik sg is the same but this is just my experience rn but)  Uk is just a racist/sexist bunch.
12075,"And confronting people with the response of ""I'm not racist/sexist/-ist, I'm a nice guy, you're too sensitive"" makes me want to beat the living shit out of them although that would cause an expulsion bc wdyk, I'm just another moneybag for the university."
12076,"Wish our current government, gets off their high horses and acknowledge the subtle racism and work the many subtle problems before it spirals out of control."
12077,I'm not sure if it's just me since I already have some mental health issues but it feels like the general mood is more down this time round and we're starting to see even more issues like the discrimination against healthcare workers/increased racism etc.
12078,And also I do not agree racial preferences in dating are racism simply because race by itself implies a lot of cultural and religious characteristics.
12079,Crying racism and expecting people to change because idealism is not going to accomplish anything
12080,"It's not a small minority, Indians and PRCs make up a big chunk of immigrants here after all."
12081,I'm just thankful that the maid didn't take it out on the children.
12082,"These days, the kids are left alone with the maids, with the abuse it must be tempting to take it out on the employer's children..."
12083,I'm legit planning to take non VTL flight cause no PCR on arrival and I'm more than happy to stay at home for 7 days :P
12084,I'm less worried about the implication by some other posters that there will be riots (that's an unfair stereotype based off ONE incident) than about a spike in dormitory cases overwhelming our healthcare system and spilling over to wider Singaporean society.
12085,"Our control measures have been extraordinarily successful, but the failure to apply them to migrant worker dormitories from the beginning was a costly oversight that the government has to deal with."
12086,"I did, and I'm willing to say that Singapore needs to do much better with regards to LGBT rights and protections offered to migrant workers."
12087,"You, however, aren't even willing to face the exploitation of migrant workers in the US, and even worse, the implicitly allowed illegal immigration!"
12088,1 illegal immigrant is an illegal.
12089,"If your xenophobic ass wants to label everyone who disagrees with you as PRC, go ahead I guess, I have nothing to offer to that aside from copious amounts of irony."
12090,As far as I can see they all have no quarantine (just test before fly) except Thailand but just 1 night and have non VTL flights back.
12091,(Especially to wherever I go not just end up in some hated expat culture clique.)
12092,"She says the market is horrible right now and that I should sign a 3 year lease agreement with potential expat tenant and agree to his demands (approx $10000 worth of work including purchasing dryer and dining table and installing brand new air-con--note the place currently has working air-con, just old window units)."
12093,I'm more inclined to think it's less about xenophobia but more about general paranoia
12094,"The first reason is that our potential immigrants are mostly motivated by job seeking, as opposed to asylum-seeking, or seeking a different ""way of life"" (like what people seek when they emigrate to Taiwan, Australia) or other reasons."
12095,"On the other hand, immigrants from China and India are almost cookie-cutter (have a degree from NUS/NTU)."
12096,"In case I sound like I am bashing any party here, I'll admit that there are positives to the immigration policy as well as negatives."
12097,"The ""cold hard truth"" can be racist, like if somebody asked why African Americans were segregated in the Jim Crow south and then somebody responded with a rant about how they are thugs who must be controlled."
12098,I'm not Chinese and I absolutely don't find it 'racist'.
12099,The most racist thing to do for them would be to totally not give a fuck and have any sort of engagement efforts for the event.
12100,Saying I'm racist seems incorrect because I'm wilfully as ignorant about my own culture as compared to any other.
12101,I'm not a new citizen but I'm racist.
12102,There's alot of paralysis by analysis whereas the expats tend to make decisions and be confident about it.
12103,I'm not an expat but I work in an F&B outlet that happens to have a good share of expat customers.
12104,"I'm not an expat, I'm an immigrant."
12105,"I'm not an expat, but for finding a place, you could download the app Carousell and go to the Housing tab to find places."
12106,"based on convenience, such as being closer to your company)  I really suggest you do more research, perhaps you could use a website like https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/  I'm just an 18yo, so I hope this helps :)"
12107,I'm not an expert but technically you are not breaking any laws per se; since you have a return ticket back home you can show proof of nonimmigrant intent.
12108,I'm not and I think there is a difference between being simply insensitive to someone's feelings and racist.
12109,To be racist is to be biased and prejudiced because of someone's skin color.
12110,I can also see how it will come across as racist if I'm a malay nurse and my patient takes my offer up for a chinese nurse.
12111,"I see how it can look racist, but looking at how the exchange went down, I highly doubt that was the lady's intentions."
12112,But it still doesn't change the fact that it has nothing to do with CECA.
12113,It would've happened even if CECA didn't exist because it seems to me like a cultural thing where people from certain countries want to 'look after their own'.
12114,"Even migrant workers are more positive than you lot, posting  tiktok videos while in quarantine."
12115,"I don't think Indians or Malays should, ideally, be making racist remarks."
12116,Preference is not and cannot be racism.
12117,"I'm not defending racists btw, but I'm just curious."
12118,How many times has this sub reddit had a thread about racism that doesn't end up spiraling down into madness?
12119,"If you can disrespect a racist, why on earth should he respect what you have to say then?"
12120,"I'm not denying xenophobia exists in Canada or that immigrants don't face difficulties, just that the policy does not take ethnicity into account like Singapore while achieving results on par with Singapore."
12121,We also face problems of xenophobia and public push-back to immigration as you mentioned despite most of them being the same ethnicity.
12122,I'm not calling for open-borders just that the current aim of maintain a demographics balance is pointless discrimination that hurts Singapore by letting in less qualified immigrants soley because of their race.
12123,"Considering 1/5th of the population is made of foreign workers (expats, constructions, it doesn't matter) wouldn't be fair to reserve 1/5 of the doses for those considering the final purpose is to vaccinate the nation?"
12124,I'm not getting that impression from the OP since he says it's a crisis and more than 1/2 are foreign workers
12125,If yes then I agree with u it's racism.
12126,"As most here have suggested, it would be better to get a third party like MOM or a migrant worker help center to step in."
12127,I'm not going to deny that there is a racism problem here.
12128,"Neither should we be compared relative to europe as ""more racist"" because there are some ways europe is dealing with racism better but there are some ways europe is doing worse."
12129,"Then again, you can stick to the racist theme if that better fits the story."
12130,"I couldn't care less if it's racism or sexism, if it's discrimination or malicious then that cannot be left unchecked."
12131,"But if the case is still currently under investigation with only one side of the story released, why do people jumped straight to the conclusion that it's racism?"
12132,"I'm not offended by any of the terms, I just find it rather odd that a pejorative term gets labeled as racist in one place but is completely acceptable in another."
12133,Always seemed iffy to me that the govt segregates the foreign worker population to the far flung areas of SG.
12134,a 39 year old Singaporean expat would be prioritized as they are much more vulnerable than a 19 year old local citizen.
12135,"I'm not participating in the debate whether a maid in Singapore is a slave or not, but ""slaves don't get paid at all"" is just plain wrong."
12136,"South Africa was excellent in reporting the new variant within a week of its detection, but they were immediately responded with border closures and trade isolation."
12137,"However, what I do question is your implied assertion that not doing so, or not doing so sufficiently, is somehow racist."
12138,"It is good for one to broaden their understanding of other cultures, but not doing so doesn't imply racism."
12139,"I'm not quite sure that you are, because any time there's a mention of xenophobia I've seen a knee jerk reaction from you to defend yourself in this thread and you start name calling people as woke, etc, rather than have a discussion with anyone who tries to tell you that this practice is often rooted in xenophobia sensibilities."
12140,"I know it can be hard to actually examine whether it is xenophobic since everyone's natural tendency is to defend themselves when they feel like they are being attacked, but you need to calm down, and actually think about whether it is."
12141,"Anyway, I do think that there's a need for a more transparent system for giving PR/citizenship, but I don't think there's a need for a language test."
12142,The endearing Singlish that helps to identify people from Singapore and the food that we're so proud of wouldn't have happened if the British decided that immigrants needed to pass a language test and be able to speak English.
12143,I'm not really contributing much to the discussion but I just wanted to point out that you can be racist to your own race
12144,"I'm not saying racism in Singapore is worse than the US, that was not my point."
12145,"I'm not saying that it's fine, but to claim that a place is ""more racist"" even before you have actually been there, and then claiming multiple observations from a singular perspective, is extremely judgmental and a tad pretentious."
12146,"Racism exists in Singapore, but whether it is more racist than other places, I'm quite skeptical from my experiences."
12147,I'm not singaporean but I grew up with a maid at home.
12148,"He said ""this space up here above the machine can be used as the maids sleeping area"" I was horrified."
12149,"I'm not so sure, I think public opinion and the general attitude of the dormitories since covid has come to a point where employers can no longer treat foreign workers however they want."
12150,"I'm not supportive of racism, I'm just saying that it exists because people can think whatever they want"
12151,Perhaps a middle-ground would be hiring a maid?
12152,Or am I racist for saying there is difference in physiology?
12153,LKY is definitely racist because he has no evidence that Malays are genetically inferior.
12154,I understand why it is not politically correct and has been hijacked by racists and white supremacist.
12155,"But by putting fingers in our ears and say ""no there is no difference"" when there are good signs that there are and absolutely no good reasoning to assert there isn't any difference only serve to fuel ignorance and ironically racism."
12156,As for visa-  You will most likely come here on employment pass.
12157,Your employment pass can be gotten once you already have an offer for employment from a company/government and they will inform you of the procedures.
12158,I'm not sure being racist is 100% legal.
12159,"If every his victims are encouraged not to make a police report, then he will never be found out to be a habitual racist instead of a one-off incident which leads to more victims down the road."
12160,"I'm not sure how I feel about this situation because it's a she-say-they-say kind of situation, but can we just keep in mind that this doesn't discount other more clear-cut cases of racism that occur in Singapore."
12161,"It is a fact that the vast majority of people living in dorms where outbreaks are happening happen to be foreign workers, hence my use of the term ""foreign worker dorms""."
12162,I'm not sure how you jump to the conclusion that I am claiming it's not racist.
12163,"My personal view is that, contrary to your misguided assumption, it is racist to choose renters based on their race."
12164,"Also, considering that a rental arrangement is a long-term commitment for both parties, I think that it's extremely unwise for a renter to ""legally force"" a racist landlords to offer their property."
12165,"As such, it is actually GOOD that racist landlords are not hiding their prejudices behind some facades."
12166,Imagine signing a 2 year contract with a racist landlord who will find ways to kick you out on the filmiest excuse and confiscate your deposit.
12167,I'm not sure if racist but I would definitely say xenophobic.
12168,I'm not sure if that's possible as no new VTL tickets are being sold.
12169,"Singapore's situation, a heavily policed state that is *still dealing* with racism, provides an obvious outer limit on the effectiveness of top down regulation of racial issues."
12170,"We are one party state, where the party also controls all media, school curriculum, and so on, we have anti-racism laws, we can detain people without trial and we also have a state pushed campaign for racial harmony.... and we still have teenagers wanting to attack mosques."
12171,"What I mean by ""promoting animosity"" are those that use this case to condemn and label a whole group of people as racists."
12172,"In fact, I have even been to westlite dormitory at toh guan where it's currently a cluster."
12173,"Again, I reiterate my same points: there are rooms which are dirty but there are also rooms that are clean in that dormitory."
12174,"As a result, most dormitories cater these facilities for their occupants within the dormitory itself."
12175,In the dormitory itself not all workers work 8-5.
12176,"I'm not sure it'd be good to call it a VTL if there's an isolation period, but maybe a follow up ART test after a few days or something."
12177,"I'm in no way supportive of this culture, and you can be sure MOM knows about this issue just that there is no perfect solution to better protect local employees other than to make it more tedious for firm to hire expats"
12178,"It extends zero regulation over smaller dorms and other housing types (shophouses, HDB flats, private housing), which hold nearly half of all migrant workers."
12179,"That's not to excuse what a shambolic job Jo Teo has done because, even now, the migrant worker situation is still abysmal."
12180,"For young families, maids are usually needed when the parents are at work; if the parents are working retail/FnB during public holidays, then the maid needs to be around to look after the kids."
12181,"I will of course be in favor of an off-in-lieu, so the maid can have a day off when the parents have a day off as well."
12182,"I think the point about sharing space with a stranger really boils down to your perspective: are maids part of one's family, or merely working for a family?"
12183,"And I'm not talking about the VTL, but WPHL – Germany is also on a ""safer countries"" list there."
12184,I'm sorry to have made you feel uncomfortable by presenting a balanced and moderate response to a hysterical article making poor arguments about institutionalised racism in our country.
12185,"I'm not throwing out a race card because the discussion at had is about racism, is it not ?"
12186,"I'm not trying to be pugnacious here, like I love Singapore and I don't think Singaporeans are racist or anything."
12187,"My whole argument is that the resentment of expat workers is misplaced, that's all."
12188,"I've recently moved here, and I keep hearing about expats being paid more."
12189,"Now, expats being better off than locals is a pretty common concept, it's obviously the more educated/talented people from each country that tend to go abroad."
12190,"I'm not xenophobic, I just want all these foreigners out of the country!"
12191,I'm not xenophobic.
12192,I'm not xenophobic.
12193,I'm not xenophobic.
12194,There is just a lot more casual xenophobia going around both ways.
12195,I'm on a 7 day SHN now (with PCR test) because I took an empty non-VTL flight.
12196,Whereas the crowded and full VTLs are given pretty much almost free reign to go out and about...
12197,I would love to know if there are married couples here in a similar situation and how you go about teaching them your mother tongue.
12198,"And if it means we should pay more for construction and labour costs so that migrant workers get a more decent standard of living, then I think we should do it."
12199,"Once, I was with my grandma in the lift and her friend asked if I'm the Indonesian maid."
12200,I just fail to comprehend how a few cases of maid abuse implies we are fascist; we aren't even the worst offenders by a long margin
12201,I'm pleased for you that you're able to go home and the testing seems a bit less stupid than for the air VTLs.
12202,I will say however that if the government deems an ART test before departure sufficient for people coming in by bus from Malaysia then the requirement that people flying in (on VTL flights) take a PCR test on arrival in addition is completely inconsistent.
12203,"When ministers hashed out the land VTL they realised that $500 for testing, which is what the current VTL costs you both ways) would be unaffordable so they just watered it down."
12204,I'd love to think that opening this VTL lane with its one single ART test before arrival will be so glaringly obviously inconsistent that they'll make the rest of the travel testing policies more sane.
12205,"(If that's a term)   Singaporeans are quite racists, it is to no fault of their own since the government strongly supports race based laws specially housing regulations which are aimed at maintaining the countries' racial makeup."
12206,I've heard from other American expats that it is sometimes hard to date here because a lot people will only date within their own race.
12207,"That said the Expat community is quite strong, not as strong as Hong Kong but there are plenty of American and OTHER expats."
12208,I don't know why people are raising pitchforks and pushing the racism card when it is not their property at stake.
12209,I'm pretty sure she has spoken to more migrant workers than the average person in r/sg
12210,Isn't the migrant worker situation like the number 1 priority now?
12211,I'm putting your logic at work (racial preference is the very definition of racism) by saying sexual preference is the very definition of sexism.
12212,"If business, expats is the same isn't it?"
12213,You're quite clearly an expat.
12214,I don't think expats should import whatever cultural baggage they have to Singapore.
12215,"The system is not racist, I believe you just don't understand this is how things work in Singapore."
12216,The migrant workers are a major pillar of Singapore's growth and I thank them for their contribution.
12217,We honestly have to improve the way we treat our migrant/foreign workers.
12218,"I realized that in my 3 years here, I have never experienced blatant or even casual racism (I hope it'll continue to be this way), and people were genuinely respectful regardless of the color of your skin, even if the media portrayed America as an incredibly racist country."
12219,"At 17 one should have neither such rigid views nor harbour so much hatred and racism, trust me I've walked this earth a (few) more decades than you and in many more places."
12220,I'm referring to our foreign workers in other sectors.
12221,I'm referring to the 7 day ART testing on landing from VTL flights.
12222,"I'm sad that even after you identified yourself as a Malay, instead of listening to why you think this is racist, the other poster simply challenges your view."
12223,"I'm saying that while it has happened before, maid abuse is not a *common occurrence* as Asia Boss has made it out to be."
12224,I joined the Facebook group for FDW Employers but was so disgusted by the prevailing mentality there so I quickly left.
12225,"The amount of manpower and co-ordination for ""the government"" to get a bunch of policemen to patrol a shopping mall is tiny compared to the massive effort visiting and checking on every maid in Singapore."
12226,"Not sure if you've noticed, but we are rather preoccupied with 300,000 migrant workers now."
12227,Not to mention the paperwork involved in interviewing every single maid for signs of abuse.
12228,Do the police work for foreign maids now?
12229,Do MOM employees work for maids now?
12230,And your suggestion of getting the government to teach maids how to remit money is utterly moronic.
12231,"From supposedly liberal Redditors, to people on Facebook who can literally see this unfolding in front of them but choose to deny any evidence of racism; from people on HWZ, to people irl - it's gaslighting galore."
12232,"Yes, the ""C-CA"" backlash is uniquely racist in a way that the backlash against Malaysians and PRCs isn't."
12233,The CECA does not force Singapore to favour Indian workers over other workers.
12234,"Without the CECA the same people will be here doing the same job, giving Singaporeans the same discreminatory hiring practices."
12235,CECA is and always has been immaterial to this.
12236,"I'm sorry i know this is a sensitive topic, especially with all the recent racism cases."
12237,Exactly the same thing I've experienced when reporting racism.
12238,Just another elitist racist smart ass.
12239,People like him and the other racists on this thread amount to absolutely nothing irl.
12240,Now try telling me how clearly defined racism is.
12241,Why did the nurse even ask that question if she did not presume the lady was racist?
12242,"The racism aside, your first paragraph describes conduct by the instructor which was dangerous to you and to other road users."
12243,I grew up with racist parents (I grew up hearing things like if you don't behave ah pu neh neh will catch you - you can imagine why kids repeat what their parents say).
12244,"I went to a mixed race secondary school and thats when I learnt to get along with other races.. even in my first year of sec school, I said pretty racist stuff that I didn't realise was racist.. it was only through seeing my classmate's reaction that made me realise my response was wrong and hurt them."
12245,"That being said, I do think that things are getting better with the younger generation and its mainly a larger portion older generation that are racist."
12246,"Its really sad to see the adults enabling their kids to be racist, and I can imagine how horrible it feels to be in that situation myself."
12247,"I know there are racists in Norway, but not all Norwegians are racist."
12248,And the person expressing these racists thoughts is highly educated too.
12249,It's actually stereotyping and not racism.
12250,"Hence, the racism premise which you built upon is wrong."
12251,I'm sure there are some racists in Singapore.
12252,I myself have made some racist jokes when I was much younger and I'm guilty of it.
12253,I do agree that casual racism happens very often.
12254,"Whether racism comes from the majority or minority race, it's still racism."
12255,"I'm Chinese , I have experienced racism from minorities despite being from the majority , but minorities had it worse."
12256,"But as I've said, the Indian expats I met (and some of their husbands /wives too) aren't arrogant or self-entitled."
12257,Do you have any examples of online xenophobia?
12258,It's a clear case of racism/bigotry/generally-being-an-arsehole.
12259,When did the practice of meritocracy---directly or indirectly--- ever exculpate or encourage bigots and racists?
12260,Just because Singapore actively preaches meritocracy and suffers from racism does not mean the former is a cause of the other (and most certainly not a direct cause).
12261,"This sub often hates on expats for various bullshit reasons (stealing jobs, stealing girls are both quite childish), but I feel there is (positive, biased) racism targeted towards white people (can share stories if interested) and I hate every single instance of it."
12262,"I'm sort of baffled at the framing of this story; is this man supposed to be heroic for ""screaming at maid""?"
12263,"Is the domestic worker, the one who was actually at greatest risk of injury, so unimportant that a quote from her--using her own words to describe her own experience--was deemed irrelevant?"
12264,I'm still not sure how this is racist?
12265,I hope the maids receive some form of psychological support after this episode too..
12266,"I'm still waiting to hear someone go ""forsooth"", ""zounds"", ""by Jove that thunders"", or ""by my troth and maidenhead"", as well as whatever else they can lift from [Shakespeare](http://www.shakespeareswords.com/Swearing)."
12267,I'm sure a $15 a day migrant worker who is probably still paying off the huge ass debt he took on to get here and is currently fearing for his own life from the virus has a fantastic bargaining position to demand an apology from a minister.
12268,"I'm sure a majority aren't, there's just a vocal minority who inject racism into their views or fall for the most egregious rumours about China."
12269,"Did the immigrant population (Chinese, Indians and Eurasians) see themselves as a part of this island (ie a citizen/Singaporean) or were their allegiance still to their home country?"
12270,I'm sure he means the racist  commenters on the post itself.
12271,I'm sure most of us are not racist.
12272,I'm sure racism happens in rental markets worldwide to be honest.
12273,I'm sure some maids rather have their own room (bomb shelter) than share a room with a family member.
12274,I'm sure that the VTL was restricted to air travel because LHL kiam siap the 100k of airport tax.
12275,Some foreign workers are fickle.
12276,The same community of users who whine and bitch about covid restrictions are now mocking expats for doing the same...
12277,Except that the expats have the ability to actually relocate.
12278,They themselves are pretty fucking racist too.
12279,I'm tall so I've never gotten mistaken for the family maid but my sister is small sized so she's been mistaken multiple times in the past.
12280,">Or you know,.. maybe if the gov finally try to solve the racism issue, instead of denying that the problem existed, then we might be rid of issues like this?"
12281,I'm the racist fuck.
12282,"That is the reason why they extended this lockdown, without foreign workers Singapore can't function as they normally do."
12283,"If this was an Indian or Filipino person, I'm not very sure the term 'expat' would be used to describe them in the headline."
12284,Haven't seen my family in 2 years so I'm really hoping the VTL doesn't get deferred.
12285,"I'm travelling from NL to Singapore in 3 weeks' time but quite concerned that either the VTL will be stopped, or that Singapore will increase domestic restrictions making the trip a bit pointless."
12286,I'm travelling on VTL right now so this affects me.
12287,"You can be angry but I'm asking is racist, this word is even necessary."
12288,I'm trying to put an itinerary for December and it seems like SIA operates both VTL and non-VTL flights for the same countries.
12289,For a non-VTL flight the only additional requirement is an SHN at home for free and PCR on day 7.
12290,This additional quarantine requirement is not really an inconvenience for me and reduces the burden for finding specific VTL flights which are also insanely expensive.
12291,"U bo chup say nothing to gain, I got my own daiji and worries to settle, where got so boliao go convince my mother, then ur maid suffer lor."
12292,I'm usually not with the Govt but on this he is correct that racism has no place in Singapore.
12293,I'm waiting for an app that bypasses maid agencies
12294,I'm well aware that racism is still a thing because humans are tribal by nature.
12295,We have to be more aware of how our actions may come across as racist.
12296,"I'm white but am second generation born and raised in Singapore so I'm kind of local, but at the same time pass as an expat."
12297,"In my experience the expats I know live in their own world and often never actually bother to reach outside of it, all their friends, co-workers etc."
12298,Only place I have ever experienced racism is SG.
12299,"There is some subtle ""not part of the group"" racism in Japan, but the only time I have had actual racism is here."
12300,"Towards the end of the first decade of 2000, I sensed a dislike of white people in HK but never experienced anything I would call racist."
12301,Actual racism is a taxi not picking you up because white guy in town on Friday night - some guy telling me to go back where I come from because I asked him to move his car from a disabled space.
12302,"**  There was another post on this sub a few days ago where I was told that all Australians are racist, and that all white guys in asia are pedophiles."
12303,I am fully aware that racism is a problem in Australia.
12304,But not all Australian's are racists and nor are Singaporeans.
12305,"There are ill-educated racist dickheads in all countries - but uniquely in Asia, it seems to be acceptable to say racist things in Singapore."
12306,"But yea, a lot of our racism isn't overt, but I do think it has been getting better."
12307,"There's still lots of borderline racist 'jokes' in the younger generation, but I do think it's less sinister than the actual racist views of the past."
12308,"I would understand if a Chinese man is outraged at the racism they experience in places like the US or UK, but I hardly think a Singapore Chinese faces anywhere the same level of problems living here."
12309,"About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene."
12310,"A close friend of mine shared a couple interesting stories from one of these foreign worker sites, though."
12311,Indian and Bangladeshi workers are racist toward each other.
12312,"I'm wondering, does the survey give any definition of racism or does it just ask people if they think that racism occurs frequently."
12313,"The thing is, sometimes what we might consider to be not racist might actually be racist."
12314,"I mean, using the words ""Apuneneh"" or making comments about how it is surprising to see Malays in universities, is racist."
12315,Like they will probably see racism to be like vitriolic hatred of another race.
12316,"But when I tell them that it is not cool for them to do so, and it is racist, they get indignant and say that it is not racist but they are just having a laugh."
12317,"So yeah, maybe the issue is not so much whether people think racism occurs but rather what they see to be racist."
12318,"If they have time to be posting racist comments on social media and creating fake profiles, why are they not focusing all their time to either find or act on solutions to their own plight?"
12319,"My views are based on MY lived experience as an expat living in other countries -- some more developed than Singapore, others less so, and even ones where I'm the marginalized minority (or look like them)."
12320,I've always disliked the fact that our mother tongues are considered dialects.
12321,I've always found this so sad how both groups (angmoh expats and locals) don't really mix together...
12322,And let's not kid ourselves - Brexit is born of anti-immigration and racist sentiments.
12323,I've always wondered why is their racism always so specific?
12324,I've been approached before and am clearly not expat.
12325,"I've been browsing The Real Singapore page and my god, that site is really a cesspool of ignorant, naive, bigoted racist and xenophobic Singaporeans."
12326,People aren't born racist; they're taught.
12327,"As long as our ethnicity is on our ICs, we will continue to be as pathologically racist as pre-revolution South Africa or the USSR."
12328,I've been in Australia for a total of 6 years now and I've yet to experience any racism - at work or in public or in school.
12329,I've been in Singapore for a year working with a mixed crowd of locals and expats.
12330,"I might be more oblivious when it comes to the implicit racism (work relationships, customer service interactions), but I don't feel like I've been held back, or had unpleasant experiences because of my race."
12331,"Of course, people may very well be racist behind my back, but what am I supposed to do about that?"
12332,"I'm not going to make assumptions about a person being racist just because they ""fit the profile""."
12333,"Sometimes it feels like the people who complain the most about being on the receiving end of racism are the ones who go in fully expecting it, almost like they're looking for it."
12334,"The rising casual xenophobia and nationalism in a far right sense scares me a little, in addition to people criticising the US for comments and thought processes that quite a few in Singapore have in common."
12335,"I've tried to get outside the expat bubble as much as possible, although it's not always easy."
12336,I find when I tell expats I stay in hdb they give me a 'oh' kind of reaction.
12337,I understand social class comes into play and many expats are not well informed about hdbs but what do western expats thinks about hdbs?
12338,"I've not had any serious incidents where I'd call outright ""racism"" against me."
12339,Where you are also factors in a lot when it comes to racism.
12340,I've been mistaken for a maid before bc i have big age gap with my sister and i was so upset (i was in sec sch and shes a baby)
12341,How much do other expat professionals my age make?
12342,"Even before that, there have been considerably fewer policemen and ""ambassadors"" patrolling the more atas areas in Singapore where expats tend to live as compared to the heartlands."
12343,"For those who don't know, a Singaporean named Mr Zhao apparently decided to take things into his own hands by advising several foreigners (or ""expats"" if you want to be PC about it) along Robertson Quay to put on their mask properly."
12344,"I can see some of you jumping off your butts now protesting that ""Not all expats are like that""."
12345,"The expat community has little to no control over how the authorities, and by extension society, view them."
12346,"Disgusting response by the expats above aside, the question is why did Mr Zhao have to take things into his own hands in the first place?"
12347,"Whether the enforcers of CB are turning a blind eye to expats due to orders from above, or due to their own accord, it has become painfully clear that these ""expats"" are getting off easy."
12348,"Whether they think more highly of ""expats"", or if it's simply because they don't trust the locals enough to follow the law, it's sadly apparent that they aren't even trying to hide the bias."
12349,I have no doubt that this post is going to receive alot of backlash from the PC gang and maybe even a few expats trying to plead their case.
12350,"But, for those foreign workers who live in the dorms, ther Circuit Breaker is still not over."
12351,"I've been seeing loads of comments and posts on how the recent spike in cases is due to India, followed by the classic comment 'I'm not racist, but' and I'm tired of it."
12352,Yet everyone has of course jumped to conclusions (because they're definitely not racist /s).
12353,"Singapore needs foreign workers to do all the jobs that most Singaporean don't want to do, whether that be construction, healthcare or elderly care."
12354,"CLARIFICATION: The need for foreign workers is a separate issue, the point is that currently foreign workers are required."
12355,What I am trying to discuss here which is the underlying racism towards Indians.
12356,"Great summative comment from u/brahbrah_not_babara...  *No one likes to be called out on racism, or be reminded to examine their comments."
12357,"Sure, not every comment on here is racist, but there are far too many racist comments which are upvoted."
12358,And any comment that tries to call out the racism is then mocked and downvoted.
12359,"It's not smart or funny to preemptively mock the comments calling out racism, you're just too sensitive to actually look at the racism that exists on the sub."
12360,*  *The reason why the govt had to clarify that the decision to close borders to non citizens and PRs isn't a racist move is because way too many of us are.
12361,Is it pretty easy to get a maid to clean like twice a month?
12362,"(case number not specified)  #April 5  **Case 1,018**: Linked to Cochrane Lodge II (4 Apr) but moved to Cochrane Lodge I (5 Apr)  #April 4  **Case 1,106**: Linked to Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (3 Apr) but moved to Toh Guan Dormitory (4 Apr)"
12363,"As much as I disagree with her views, I doubt they're uncommon, and I can't really see people emphatising with foreign workers in a situation like this when having an 'us vs them' mentality is so much easier."
12364,"I want to say, many Singaporean advocate ~~slavery.~~ (hyperbole)  Whether knowingly or unknowingly, the working conditions for foreign workers here in Singapore is atrocious."
12365,The maids of many families never get off days.
12366,"Well, you paid for a small space for the maid to sleep."
12367,Recently there was an article about maids should have a full 24 hour day off.
12368,Foreign workers in dormitory have always been kept in a very bad conditions.
12369,"I do not understand why many people continue to be racist towards them, and always shun them away like plague."
12370,~~I find that we are no different from Qatar when it comes to the treatment of foreign workers in Singapore.
12371,Am I wrong to say that many Singaporeans ~~advocate slavery?~~ (Hyperbole) Authorities could have done more to improve working conditions for migrant workers.
12372,"I guess we're in an intermediate period--racism against whites is going out of fashion, but there hasn't been a new trend to replace it yet."
12373,So what do you think will be the next big thing in racism?
12374,"Wendy Low (from PSP) going ""new citizens are citizens too"" was promising, but also basically the *only* rhetoric remotely friendly to immigrants that the PSP put out."
12375,"I'm the child of immigrants, and I'm damn well not going to pull the ladder up behind me."
12376,"I think there's a fair amount of racism in Singapore, people just don't talk about it that much."
12377,I've experienced racism both in Singapore and here.
12378,"When racist hatred is exposed to the light of day, and it's seemingly normalized by the current leadership, that's problematic."
12379,I also don't think racism gets stronger if banished to the darkness.
12380,"If its head rears up, and it's okay for racism to exist, then I think it grows stronger, not weaker."
12381,I've had a Filipino domestic helper who was the absolute best.
12382,After we grew up she went to Europe (I think Spain) to continue her job as a domestic helper.
12383,He told me he'll never move to Australia because they're racist and he asked me why would I want to go there.
12384,But I was once told we would never know until we hire a maid ourselves.
12385,"I've heard that working with expats is a positive experience overall, because of (I'm generalising here) their outgoing and warm disposition, compared to locals."
12386,"The term expat, when used colloquially, implies ""foreigner with high income and upper-management position"", so I guess it's to be expected that locals often rate them highly in terms of work ethic and soft skills."
12387,"Compared to local parlance, expat-lingo tends to be exaggerated and full of what I've heard people term 'fluff'."
12388,"This is perhaps a cultural clash, because I think Singaporeans are, by nature, quite stingy with praise and bad at small talk in general, so expats (especially westerners) can come off as ""all talk, but no substance"" to some locals who are overly result-oriented."
12389,"I think it's natural that you hear more of the negative stuff about locals working with expats, because those are stories that *sell* - bad experiences always make for better conversation, and spread easily through word-of-mouth."
12390,Any other non-VTL destinations i should look into?
12391,"I've kinda given up arguing in this subreddit, because most people here seem to have completely forgotten that many of their grandparents/great-grandparents were probably immigrants, themselves."
12392,I've learned I am pretty much CMIO.
12393,CMIO is too simplistic and it was only in 2010 they acknowledged mixed race individuals by allowing double barreled race on the NRIC.
12394,"I've learnt that for job postings ""Chinese only"" is racist and reportable."
12395,Though even if postings are politically correct it doesn't mean that racism/sexism/all the other -ism doesn't exist in the evaluation process.
12396,"But the school fees here will kill you in the end, as an expat."
12397,"Used to be different back in the days when expats got packages, but now hardly anyone does, and it's a real killer."
12398,"Racism is widespread and endemic to Singapore, but it's a different kind of racism."
12399,"First, racism is legal, as evidenced by the recent Presidential candidate requirements or the housing board quotas."
12400,"I think those examples of legal racism, that is, differential treatment based on race, were done with good intentions in mind."
12401,"De facto racism policies like refusing to rent flats to Indians, or refusing to hire Indians, also exists."
12402,"These racist actions may technically be illegal, but in practice they are common, and I have not observed any actions to reduce this kind of racism, let alone even acknowledge it in official channels."
12403,"More subtle racism, like different treatment by shopkeepers or random aunties is also prevalent."
12404,What you are extremely unlikely to find is acute cases of violent racism.
12405,"That kind of violent racism is thankfully absent in Singapore, although in general Singapore has less public crime than most Western countries."
12406,"While it's true that most casual racism isn't very harmful on its own, it can occasionally affect employment or other important facets, even if it's not causing some sort of disastrous violence."
12407,"You can't blame racism for that young person's choices, not directly, but it definitely can have a negative impact."
12408,"Before people call me entitled expat, I came to Singapore to work and be able to enjoy SG as a travel hub."
12409,"You've got your fair share of racist and annoying pricks here and there, but most of them are nice  people."
12410,Most of us have that racist old grandparent in our family but these middle-aged people using these kind of phrase is quite disturbing
12411,"I've moved apartments several times already, and whenever landlords ask my nationality/ethnicity they almost always follow up by saying that they are not racist and that they are just concerned about strong food smells permeating the kitchen cabinets/walls."
12412,I've never considered Chinese as my mother tongue.
12413,I've never had a domestic helper (my mum is housewife) so I can't really chime in here.
12414,I've never had a maid/domestic helper and yet I don't have the said motivation either.
12415,I've never heard the 'we all look the same' racism levied against us.
12416,"And I don't want to get into any ""Singaporeans are racist"" arguments."
12417,I've noticed It's an unwritten rule that the maid/helper profession in Singapore is little more than being a slave to the employer.
12418,I've noticed maids pay about the same amount of attention to your children.
12419,"Of course, the reason is fairly simple - politics in most destination countries for Singaporean expats are usually a complete shitshow, and they don't want any of that drama in Singapore."
12420,I've only met 1 Brit expat in my course of work and I have trouble understanding him as he speaks with some regional British accent I think.
12421,"If you are allowed to hire foreign talents too easily, then companies will be less willing to train Singaporeans up or have enough incentive to create the ecosystem to transfer the expertise to local workers."
12422,"I read one thread where people were discussing changes to the PEP and one guy simply made a joke throwaway remark, a blatant joke about ""gaming the system"" and another website picked it up immediately and used it as an example, out of context, of how foreigners are trying to ""game the system""  In my personal opinion, the system is built in such a robust fashion given the high level of migration to and transient workers in Singapore, that it ensures without fail that a foreigner will firstly commit to and contribute to society in some way and then further commit and invest to have any permanency."
12423,"I've read the article and honestly, it's quite tiresome to read on the usual maids vs employers issue."
12424,I struggle to see how so many households require maids.
12425,I can bet a significant portion of the population can go without maids.
12426,"Even if this influenza is right and her maid is an absolute bitch, the way she's gone about is so awful it's hard to side with her."
12427,There's ranting and then there's what she did which was to reveal every sordid detail which her maid will be unable to respond to because this influenza controls the narrative.
12428,"I should remind you that without those ""populist"" opinions on unbridled immigration, the govn't and centrists like yourself would never have realized those sentiments reflects the legitimate issues with our immigration policy."
12429,"Of course, racism (at the individual and institutional level) is very much real and should be counteracted."
12430,"I've seen a lot of these blatant racism videos coming from Singapore, some of them were quite violent."
12431,"I've seen expat entitlement first hand in Australia, don't worry haha."
12432,I've seen many asking in group chats why we need to tighten our CB even though the spread is within the foreign worker community.
12433,The foreign worker is not the problem.
12434,All foreign workers are being tested en masse now which is why we have more confirmed cases among them.
12435,I've seen my share of maids from either extremes.
12436,"If it were up to me, all employers must go through a basic ethics examination before they are allowed to hire a maid."
12437,"I've seen so many people, manly expats, falling for the TV box scam at SimLim."
12438,"Let me explain why I feel this is not the case:  Globally, we see that these kind of jobs are increasingly filled with foreign workers, even if said jobs are paid well."
12439,S pass holders as well.
12440,"The laws here in SG actually benefits expats more, one example is that there is a minimum wage (last I checked) of $5000 for us folks."
12441,I've very rarely seen any expat with that level of salary.. and we are quite open around my friends.
12442,"I've worked in two companies with a mix of locals and expats and the most obvious difference is that lunch for expats is usually functional, quick and with packed lunch."
12443,"That said, when you're in a small office with a mix of expats and locals the differences are less obvious."
12444,We make a lot of racist jokes towards each other; like really a lot.
12445,"I guess whether a comment made is racist is defined by each individual; not everyone can take jokes, not everyone is joking when they make hurtful remarks."
12446,"I, for one, am definitely not racist."
12447,"I, for one, quite like my CECA IT colleague."

12451,Would the number of cases be much lower if it were Singaporean workers instead of migrant workers in the cramp up in the dormitories?
12452,"IMHO, most of the so called Asians(Chinese, Koreans, Japanese) are usually racist towards Indian looking folks(Bangla, Pakis..etc).. Its just the way it is."

12455,"IMO employer should be banned from hiring a domestic helper, and fined."
12456,IMO racism will continue to thrive..
12457,I think the message some people take away is I’m not suppose to be racist cause it hurts other people’s feelings..
12458,The message never seems to be that racism is wrong because it’s illogical and a tool that the ignorant use to deal with understanding a complex world.

12481,"FYI in the 1990s people used to look down on study mamas 陪读妈妈 and calll Chinese women immigrants who date old local men 乌鸦 or crows, which usually means they are mistresses or prostitutes."
12482,"Idk why everyone is suggesting studying govt policies related to immigrants and expatriates, lol."
12483,Some of the policies enacted may seem high-handed or even racist (eg HDB racial quota) but it helps keeps the status quo back in the era where racial boundaries were drawn very clearly.
12484,"I can see from the victim's perspective that if people don't take other people's culture seriously, then it signals a degree of ignorance that perpetuates racism."
12485,Maybe they feel they are at the butt of racist jokes  for too long?

12504,"I precisely mean that PA is being blunt by saying ""Sarah said that this incident is perpetuating the racist culture"", but OP defending it by saying ""it's just a repost by Sarah, doesn't mean that she's saying it"" is clearly just playing technicalities."

12537,If accusations of racism are really that serious (as PA alleges) then that same standard of seriousness should be applied to the PA's accusation that Sarah is accusing them of racism.
12538,"If you look at the quotes you have cited, the accusation of racism seems at best implied."

12673,"> By brining in some additional context, hopefully people would reconsider their absolutism wrt to racist views and not be too quick to condemn or call for the destruction of any LKY/Mahathir monuments  I've literally see no such calls, but sure I guess the scary SJW mob is a convenient scary effigy to indulge in."
12674,If we assume there is a fixed % of racist in all races (ie.
12675,"20%), that means there will be 15% of Chinese, 3% of Malays and 1.8% of Indians who are racist."
12676,"If you put all the Malay and Indian Racist tgt, that would be 4.8% of racist against Chinese."
12677,That is a **6.4% chance of Chinese facing racism.
12678,"**  If you put a Malay and Chinese racist tgt, that would be 18% racist against Indians."
12679,That is **200% chance of Indians facing racism.
12680,"**  If you put the Indians and Chinese racist tgt, that would be 16.8% of racist against Malays."
12681,That is **112% chance of Malays facing racism.
12682,"**  Yes, every race there is racist."
12683,Every person in Singapore can face racism.
12684,"But there are some who will face it more than the other, due to the super-majority demographic make up our our country  Question is: Who are the people who are likely to say, ""racism doesn't occur frequently"""
12685,"If we don’t want to live in a society where elderly cleaners clear our plates, are we ok with a society that transports migrant workers like cattle?"
12686,"If we made it harder to send experienced migrant workers home to replace them with cheap bodies, made it easier for them to find new employers, actively got rid of the employer mindset that ""seek help from MOM = troublemaker, cannot hire"", we could definitely have less migrant workers thanks to improved productivity."
12687,"We could have mandated proper MC lengths, minimum food quality for catered food, and better dorm standards, making it more costly to hire migrant workers so firms had an incentive to improve productivity and hire locals."
12688,"If we really wanted smart expats, then why do lousy degrees get 10 points in the new compass system?"
12689,The slightly xenophobic public would also have been happy with less overcrowding of migrant workers in the weekend.
12690,"If we want to eliminate racism, we got to stop blaming an entire race or group of people whenever some shitty thing happens."
12691,No excuse just because you put (racist) in parentheses.
12692,"In addition, these foreign workers and low-skilled jobs are going to have to compete in an even more competitive Singapore, where positive GDP growth might further increase our standards of living."
12693,"If what she said was true, such employers should be punished and blacklisted from hiring maids."
12694,But I have also heard of maids lying or not telling the full story for selfish reasons.
12695,"The fact that the lady, and u, assumed that just because they look filipino means they have gotten a Filipino education, is racist."
12696,"And the fact that u and the lady assumed it so, makes u guys racists."
12697,"If what you say is true, that it was intensely racist, violent, and suggested death, I think you need to escalate this."
12698,This incentive is diminished for our short term foreign workers who only stay in Singapore for a few years.
12699,"For other expats that can't leave at the moment, I also suggest leaving at the next possible moment, even if the Singapore government gets their act together."
12700,If you are here as an expat then you should have a repatriation clause in the lease.
12701,The current wave of attesting every incident to racism puts this group off and shuts down the avenues of education and communication.
12702,These days people are quick to label anything racist when they don't have their way.
12703,"If you arent willing to date any Indians at all, wouldnt you be just as racist?"
12704,"I don’t think non-bigoted minorities have to carry a card that says “I’m not a bigot!” around just to get people to listen to them - honestly, those people just sound like bigots themselves looking for an acceptable excuse to be racist by saying “look!"
12705,"I think the coronavirus was handled well though, that's why I think WaPo should either focus their article on the migrant worker situation entirely without bringing up the coronavirus, or write a different article about it and use this article to criticize our coronavirus management (which I'm certain WaPo can't because they don't have other arguments)."
12706,"But the moment you reject all Indians because you assume and think all of them have the same skin colour, that’s racist, because you are ascribing a certain attribute onto all Indians that may not apply homogenously."
12707,"maids), you will treat him/her with respect because degrading the image bearer is the same as degrading God Himself."
12708,"If you can't see that those who decry CECA is the cause of our issues with immigration and demand for data on the nationalities of our EP holders are at the very core racists, then our views differ on a very fundamental level and there really no point in discussing this further."
12709,"If you can’t stand the maid, just let her go, change a new one; why need to get yourself into such abusive employer-employee relationship  Really not worth it"
12710,"If you check the Mothership Facebook post a lot of people agree with her, while others think she treats the maid like property."
12711,If you do that then you erase the mechanism to identify systemic racism in the country while not actually doing anything to solve racism.
12712,"If there was no race identifier, then people like Beow Tan can simply claim that she is not racist because race *does not exist*."
12713,That is what is happening in France and it is one of the most racist countries towards Muslims in Europe.
12714,The actual first step is for everyone to acknowledge that racism has been a feature of Singapore society since the beginning of our formation and for people to be aware of the privilege and not dismiss concerns by minorities about racism (See brownface incident).
12715,"Then, and only then, can we have a grown up discussion about what to do about racism."
12716,*while pointing to random indian guy on the train/bus/public*  Growing up I had no idea how racist it was.
12717,"You see, although there is a possibility that the landlord is indeed a racist, but there is also the possibility there he isn't one because of the word ""preference""."
12718,"It's like if i like a girl and ask her to be my gf, and she reject me and tell me that she has a preference for Caucasians, I then right away call her a racist."
12719,"It's okay to have a preference, it's not okay to mistake preferences as racism unless there is evidence that the landlord mistreating a specific race."
12720,Having a preference or liking for a few of them doesn't mean he is racist towards any specific race.
12721,"Just like how democrats dismissed the alt-right as ""just a bunch of racists""."
12722,"If you don't want to risk wasting the 2k, fine then don't fucking hire a maid in the first place."
12723,"If you don't let someone from Hubei spit into your open mouth you're a racist, there I said it."
12724,"And now, you are allerging that singaporeans have normalized abusing maids, when it is clear that those are not norms and are newsworthy incident."
12725,"It makes me suspect that you are basing your comments on maid abuse articles you read online, which you go on to imagine is something rampant throughout singapore."
12726,"Most employers give Sunday off to their maids, you can go down to Orchard Road and actually talk to those maids to understand the reality, instead of focusing on outliers cases that are reported on the news and even taken to court."
12727,"But banning them from working is a slap in the face, and makes Singapore look rediculously xenophobic."
12728,"Meanwhile, companies in Singapore end up being less competitive because we have to pay more $$$ to attract the same foreign talents - cause their spouse can't work!"
12729,"So in the end, our tax-payer dollars are now effectively paying an únemployment benefit' to spouses of foreign expats - and to make matters worse, we're not even getting any goodwill!"
12730,"When these people return home, they tell colleagues how xenophobic Singapore is."
12731,"It's one thing to say most people have some element of bias, it's another to say most people are racist assholes like this guy."
12732,If you get offended just cos someone assumes you're from China maybe you're the racist one.

12737,"If Schools are not going to take action, for the reasons you have stated above, especially fearing backlash from parents, aren't our institutions perpetuating racism from young, by turning a blind eye?"
12738,Worksman shop from the foreign workers is trash.
12739,The foreign workers really had no concern if a tile is crooked or cut slanted or that the flooring is not flat enough that it contains stagnant water.
12740,"If you have seen VTL passengers arriving in the past recent months , you wouldn't call them elites but yes I get your drift lol."
12741,"If you just want cleaning services and you're OK with cooking sometimes and hawker dabao other times, your maid isn't going to be working 24/7 anyway."
12742,"In such a situation, I think actually you won't have enough housework for a maid to be cheaper than a part-time cleaner."
12743,"On top of that, some people (like me) consider live-in maids to be a disadvantage, because there's another person in your home."
12744,"If you look at recent definitions, xenophobia now covers not just foreigners, but other ingroups and outgroups."
12745,"If a people are so discriminatory against their own people and relatively similar 2nd gen immigrants who have grown up in Japan, speak Japanese, and look the same, I think the earlier poster's claim that xenophobia against foreigners in Japan isn't that bad is highly suspect, given his claim that you just need to look Japanese, speak Japanese, and fit in."
12746,"As for your claim that Japan is homogenous >Doudou Diène (Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights) concluded after an investigation and nine-day tour of Japan that racial discrimination and xenophobia in Japan primarily affects three groups: national minorities, descendants of former Japanese colonies, and foreigners from other Asian countries."
12747,"If you look at the expat forums, everyone 1 who goes, there are 2-4 trying to get into Singapore \*shrugs\*"
12748,Singapore struggles with racism too but we are not the US.
12749,"She reacted with shock and exclaimed, ""Dad, you are being racist!"
12750,Back then I was quite angry because I am not a racist.
12751,It's not because I'm racist.
12752,"If you make close friends here, try to be tolerant of our racist jokes."
12753,"As for expat ""package"" that depends on the specifics and your own negotiating power with the new company."
12754,"When it comes to casual, ingrained prejudice, as opposed to aggressive or violent racism Singapore is way worse than many other large, cosmopolitan first world cities (no point comparing us to Bumfuckville, Mississippi)."
12755,"If you prefer a Singaporean nurse that have served you before and did you a solid based on her performance, it is not racist to prefer that specific nurse compared to other nurses."
12756,"But when u generalize and assume that Singaporean nurses are better compared to foreign nurses(which is exactly what the lady did because she asked for a Singaporean nurse immediately), that is clearly racist."
12757,If you prefer to date someone your own race you are racist?
12758,"Then okay, I'm racist."
12759,"If you read the comments, you’ll realise that a lot of the instances of racism in Singapore stem from the illusion that Race is “real”."
12760,"However, the societal embrace of CMIO has also left us behind in the world in 2020."
12761,Many comments in this subreddit still suggest that such banter is “acceptable” or that everyday instances of micro-aggression experienced by minorities aren’t examples of “real racism”.
12762,"Mobilising public outrage against the majority through everyday instances of racism might help raise awareness of the issue but it doesn’t attempt to solve the problem that exists in how people, since colonial times, have been brought up to think."
12763,"If you really aren't racist, you wouldn't even notice what race the thief is"
12764,"If you really want to screen, nowadays so many perverts install spy cameras in their home toilets and boast about it online on Singaporean forums (you know which ones) that almost all maids are at risk of being filmed in toilets and sometimes it's even distributed online."
12765,They should teach maids to check for spy cameras.
12766,SG gonna rage at this for being racist lol.
12767,You are saying you are okay with this arrangement of racism existing simply because private property is involved
12768,"If you see race in every little thing, it just means that you are the racist."
12769,"If you see race in everything, it just means that you are the racist."
12770,"As for the maid issue that you brought up in a separate post, I think a big part of that lies in cultural differences."
12771,"If you take VTL flights, it should give you guaranteed return is it not?"
12772,"If you take a look at [the data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS?locations=SG&start=2005) (using another source since your link only goes back to 2011), it's quite clear that our unemployment rate has dropped since 2005, when CECA was signed."
12773,"Of course, it would be quite simplistic to attribute this solely to the effect of CECA, just as it was simplistic of you to blame last year's rise in unemployment on CECA."
12774,"And if you think only the 'rich' can afford to hire maids, then you're even more delusional."
12775,"Some people have no choice but to hire maids, because they have full time jobs and need someone to care for their children/parents."
12776,"If you think reddit is full of ""toxic nationalistic racists"", wait till you see the more popular social media like edmw, fb & twitter comments on news pages and groups."
12777,"Having said that, I say that he wasn't racist to imply that one shouldn't behave as if one was in the Philippines."
12778,"Also, xenophobia is not the same as racism."
12779,If you think there’s no racism against immigrant Indians here you’re sorely mistaken.
12780,Take a look through these threads - when they complain about the “odour” and “stench” and them being “pathological liars” do you think that’s economic anxiety or plain racism?
12781,"If you tighten the supply, the wages do go up accordingly, but can we possibly find enough manpower local if we are to maintain our current pace (keeping in mind that we had nearly half a million foreign workers before the pandemic, probably a good 10% of our native population)?"
12782,If you totally scrub clean all differences in race (usually done with force) there will not be racism.
12783,The privilege that these Singapore originated articles always refer to is not a by product of racism.
12784,"If you treat your own citizens as second class citizens, you will get xenophobia because everyone is competing for the same limited resources."
12785,"If you want a to avoid being labelled a racist, simply put:  ""Not ready for a non-Chinese tenant""  This statement has been cleared by the police to be non-racist, so it's safe."
12786,"If you want examples, all the points of contention with your stand on how domestic helpers are to be treated are there."
12787,"If you want to bring in large chunks of economically disadvantaged migrant workers, pay them shit wages to do respectless automaton labor, house and feed them worse than livestock in some cases, show them the reality of a world where their life is worth less than the value of a car in the courts and people cross the street to avoid them...  Are you sincerely *surprised* they'll look for meaning in backwater fundamentalist ideologies that sell self-worth and belonging to the disenfranchised?"
12788,Don't believe in the VTL?
12789,Fly non-VTL then.
12790,"Hence, VTL."
12791,That is the whole point of being an expat.
12792,"Which, in the case of Singapore happens to be English, no matter what your mother tongue is."
12793,"Also, it's more effective to get one individual to speak our most common language, rather than getting the entire population to to learn all the languages of out immigrants."
12794,"If you want to talk to an expat that is really new here (3 months) and first impressions/thoughts of the country, I'm game."
12795,"Next, trotting out the tired old cliche that most people here are descendants of once immigrants does not mean continual immigration is going to be welcomed in perpetuity."
12796,"Furthermore, empathy goes out the window the moment there is a perceived threat from these immigrants."
12797,I'm not saying immigrants don't deserve any but the current (popular?)
12798,"That, is the current roadblock towards acceptance and integration of these immigrants as we are often being seen as a stepping stone towards other greener pastures."
12799,Are you paying the maid a living wage that she can afford rent?
12800,"Based on this alone I would say yes, it would be illegal to do online gambling in Singapore even if you're an expat."
12801,It's more likely to be racist if it's another guy who gets up.
12802,"If you're a recent expat who's moved to Singapore within the past year, on a scale from 1-10, how at home do you feel?"
12803,I know expats who've lived here for 15 years still speak with their home accents and misuse 'lah' and 'leh' all the time; it's clear they don't assimilate.
12804,"If you're concerned about racism in the Singapore rental market, it's really not an issue for Europeans."
12805,Don't always get your maid do all these for you.
12806,A lot of children these days grow up expecting maid to do everything for them.
12807,"If you and your loved ones are unhappy about the maid, then go and change."
12808,"If you're flying from Germany to Sg on VTL, you can take either an ART test or PCR test at an official test centre in Germany."
12809,"If you're gleefully celebrating this news, please reflect that if expat salaries go down, it's very unlikely that local salaries are going up, hor."
12810,Have to keep up with VTL requirements as well as the destination country's requirements.
12811,Agreed with another commenter - ielts doesn't hold any value here unless you're applying for university and you're not from English speaking country.
12812,If you're renting out a full unit and decide not to let it out to people based on their ethnicity than yes that is racist.
12813,To charge a certain race more because of their ethnicity is also racist.
12814,"If you can't see anything wrong with that than yes, that makes you also a racist."
12815,"If you're not SC or PR, your HR needs to apply for re entry pass for you if non VTL."
12816,"If VTL, you can apply for VTP yourself."
12817,Since I'm not Malaysian we'll have to take the air  VTL.
12818,"If you're protected against racism as a minority, there are likely other privileges that are protecting you."
12819,"In fact, it might just be Malaysia and Indonesia that have a problem with their immigrant populations."
12820,"If you're saying that racism is an issue in those countries, then okay, you're absolutely right."
12821,"I don't see how that excuses racism in our own country, though."
12822,"Ever seen anyone ""calling out racist behaviors"" ending on a good note?"
12823,"We love white people, and bend over backwards to be friendly to western expats (as long as you're not ethnic Indian)  Racism is a problem in Singapore, but you'll be unaffected by it."
12824,"If you're white, Singapore definitely has a good expat community!"
12825,"If you, as an employer feel frightened by your maid, an employee, that alone should send signals."
12826,"Quietly do research and hire one, and let her know only when the new maid is ready to move in, otherwise she might take revenge by mixing urine with your food."
12827,"If your company were to hire a foreign worker to work from Singapore on an S pass or an employment pass (which is required for foreigners to work here), the foreign worker must earn at least 4k to be eligible for Employment pass or 2.5k for for S pass."
12828,"It's never a case of racism, it's always a case of money."
12829,If your mother tongue is Chinese you better start brushing it up.
12830,"Compare this with a domestic worker's salary, which starts at around S$500 per month depending on experience."
12831,"Rather than sending their elderly parents to live in an expensive nursing home (prices start at S$1,200 per month), many less-privileged Singaporeans opt for their parents to live with them instead, and have the domestic helper assist them with day-to-day living."
12832,"Instead of saying, ""Oh, my (privileged) parents were able to raise me without a domestic helper,"", do consider than many other Singaporean adults do not have the same financial options that your parents may have had."
12833,Nobody gives a shit so it will get worse till outward racially charged attacks happen and then everyone will act surprised and say Singapore isn’t racist.
12834,If you’re gonna compare transporting workers in lorries to working in nuclear reactors then there really isn’t a point in having this discussion is there?
12835,"Not sure whether crossing into Austria (or any other countries) actually counts as being outside of the VTL, but better safe than sorry."
12836,If you’re travelling from Singapore to one of those VTL countries do you need to get a test before boarding at changi?
12837,"Ignorance and racism are not mutually exclusive - some foreigners abroad that think that Singapore is part of China hold this notion out of ignorance, but it wouldn't be far off to call them racist for lumping all ethnic Chinese together regardless of nationality"
12838,Ignorance can breed racist attitudes.
12839,Ignorance is not racism?
12840,I'm feigning ignorance as an excuse for being racist.
12841,"If I go around saying n***er and my excuse was that I hear it everyday from songs, am I racist?"
12842,"On the other hand, if they choose to remain ignorant and double down on their racism and offensive behaviour like a certain influencer in Singapore, then they're just bigots."
12843,And you can be ignorant AND racist at the same time.
12844,Ignorance ≠ racism
12845,"If the employer is the kind to actively punish the maid just for asking, then what day they get off is going to be the least of their problems."
12846,"Because maids are all so pitiful and cannot stand up to anyone, and the boss is always a horrible human being, right?"
12847,Force employers to let the maid choose which day off?
12848,"What if as the employer, I need the maid to be in on a certain day cause that day I need go back office and my children are home?"
12849,>Imagine still thinking that any local employee is somehow disadvantaged compared to foreign workers.
12850,"A maid works from morning to night, because they have tasks morning to night."
12851,Edit: General consensus lambasted the video as racist
12852,"Il don't ubderstand the point of VTLs, designated flights, etc."

12860,"While being educated on BLM is indeed important for Singaporeans, I believe what is more important is that we try to draw links to curb racism in our shores, especially when it is still pretty prevalent even today."
12861,"We can have thousands of people posting it on insta, heck maybe even donating to the organisations, but if these people don't act on their words and curb racism within themselves and the people around them, all these posts are going to be just false positives that things are changing when it is not."
12862,It is going to be just another Police brutality protest that ends with the perpetrator in jail but no active actions towards solving the racism in the community that resulted in all of this in the first place.
12863,Why is racism still prevalent?
12864,"Isn't the whole world siding with BLM and isnt the whole world supporting its cause, then why is it that we still see racism today?"
12865,"That is why i am so angry, it is a very disrespect to BLM movement itself , it is a disgrace to see people preach about BLM when they themselves are profound racists."
12866,"I don't want these people to fight together with me for BLM, i want them to reflect upon this , and change themselves, i dont need them to donate to BLM or heck posts BLM posts, i want them to change their attitudes and heart and curb racism within themselves."
12867,"So if you are saying that one is racist, then the other must be too."

12872,But I have been told I look Eurasian so that could be it.. Its really sad to hear racism happening so casually.
12873,"But can I ask, if you are comfortable to share, do you feel that this is institutionalized racism?"
12874,or a by-product of institutionalized racism?

12890,Most of them told me I should take up Malay considering how similar the Malay language was with my mother tongue.
12891,"hence, immigrants."
12892,"For instance, immigrants can rent HDB flats from owners who may otherwise let go of their units on the resale market."
12893,"Singapore is, similar to the USA, an immigrant nation and for many years, has been very welcoming of foreigners."
12894,"Thus, this sudden xenophobia is an anomaly uncharacteristic of Singaporeans, a phenomenon manifested as a resistance towards the ills of excess foreign-importation."
12895,"By mass-importing foreign workers, the GDP will obviously increase, but judging from the angst of many Singaporeans, it doesn't seem to definitively benefit the majority of Singaporeans in an economic sense -> higher wages, greater affordability of stuff, ""good"" jobs."
12896,"Immigration and ""shrodinger's immigrant"" - where a foreigner is simultaneously taking benefits and also taking a Briton's job were hot topics in the UK."
12897,It's just easier to let the system falter and then try to blame the immigrants anyway.
12898,I say the problems of racism got much worse when the extremists got a place to hide
12899,Most expats either don't have the intent OR don't get approved for PR.
12900,"Immigration is the movement of people into a destination country which they are not natives of or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take-up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker."
12901,"Imo Malaysian Chinese can be very racist and entitled, ironically."
12902,"Imo racism is definitely bad, but talking bad about religion doesn't matter imo, it's literally a choice."
12903,"I decided to take the non-VTL flight which cost me $900 return in economy, as opposed to the around 3k you’re seeing right now."
12904,"If you have the luxury of being able to WFH during the qtine period, just take a non-VTL flight and WFH during the 7 day quarantine - that’s what I’m planning on doing."
12905,I recognise the the issue of expat bubbles in many industries including mine but that is unlikely to change given the government open policy.
12906,"Import foreign teachers, not foreign workers?"
12907,"If you think the current batch of uncles and aunties are bad, reminder that those people complaining 16 yrs ago were people whose prime were in the 70s where racism were rampant despite the ""efforts"" of the government."
12908,"In 2011, 16 maid employment agencies were fined for raising the wages of maids."
12909,"Mind you, it was not for increasing the agency fees but the increasing the wages of maids."
12910,Maybe the government should be helded more accountable for the poor conditions of foreign workers.
12911,"But I expect India-born immigrants to still be less than PRCs, Malaysians & Indonesians."
12912,"In 2013, Goverment minister Grace Fu acknowledged that Singapores immigration policy was calibrated to preserve ethenic balance by ensuring that citizens of various ethnicities were naturalized based on the proportion and birth race of their ethnic group in Singapore."
12913,People in favour of this balancing often points to Europe as an example of what happens when demographics are not taken into account when setting immigration policy.
12914,"Yet this change has had little political change as the country has remained broadly progressive with all major parties supporting immigration, in the last election the only anti-immigration party garnered just 2% of votes and immigrants votes are divided among all major parties."
12915,Being in favour of this is not nessircaly racist and there are merits to the argument that changing it is a pointless risk.
12916,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/grace-fu-proportion-of-malays-in-citizen-population-will-not-shrink  *Divided between anglophone and francophone immigrants is resolved by geographics separation that allows Quebec to maintain it's own immigration policy to prevent feelings of replacement which isn't applicable to singapore.
12917,"In 2013, the then-managing director of Microsoft Singapore Helene Auriol [said](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=search&k=Lack%20of%20global%20exposure,%20Gen%20Y%20staff%20among%20managers%27%20top%20concerns)  that “MNCs need to connect with the rest of the world … and it’s very  challenging to find strong (Singaporean) leaders with a real  international background.”  Speaking at the same human resources conference as Auriol,  the then Canon Singapore president and chief executive officer Kensaku  Konishi said that Singaporeans find it hard to adapt to new  environments: “They just complain that it’s different from Singapore.”  If it weren’t for expats coming to fill certain  international market knowledge gaps, the urgency for Singaporeans to  travel abroad would be much higher."
12918,"“The industry in Singapore thrives because expats are ready  to work here,” explained Rohit Bhattacharya, a 27-year-old who recently  moved to Singapore for a consulting job."
12919,"“As expats we not only bring talent, but we bring in a  good business into the country from where we were before.”  Beyond a personal level, international companies as a whole also contribute to the local economy."
12920,It seems that a lot of Singaporeans seem to think the expat world  still looks like the 1990s ….. it’s not like that anymore.”  Kym is referring to the ‘expat contracts’ that were a norm in  Singapore during the 90s and 2000s.
12921,"While  these packages are rare to find today, the perception of expats among  local Singaporeans remains that they come to the country on high  payrolls, with the intention to leave after a few years."
12922,"But [research shows](https://expatresearch.com/files/8615/0444/1557/McNulty_2016_IJMCS.pdf)  that more expats live in Singapore with fewer benefits now, often  without employment guarantees from MNCs, and with a much longer-term  intent to stay than ever before."
12923,"The integration of foreigners has increasingly improved over  the years, but expats who have moved to Singapore in recent months have  found it especially hard to do so."
12924,"“The government literally said we don’t care about foreigners  right now,” she says, “And then the people said they don’t care about  artists, so I felt like I don’t belong here … like I’ll always be a  stranger.”  “I can’t even clean the beach because I’m not Singaporean.”  “I support the government’s decision to help locals in this  time, but I hope that in doing so they don’t forget about expats who  have made this place their home.”"
12925,"And the weakness will be the uncaring attitude towards manual migrant workers whom are thrown away when it gets inconvenient, and treated as expendable."
12926,In HK there's an expat bubble.
12927,"In Singapore, just being here you're already inside the expat bubble."
12928,"True or not, this racist woman deserves to have the above happen to her."
12929,"EDIT: thinking some more after putting my ire aside, an unvaccinated racist is more dangerous than a vaccinated racist..."
12930,"In Indonesia, many household employ male domestic workers too."
12931,In SG it's the Chinese from China who are the target of racist comments.
12932,"In SG we refer to expats as ang moh DK, not indians."
12933,"In Singapore, it's illegal for a FDW *not* to live with their employers."
12934,"In Singapore, most expats live in condominums and most Singaporeans (your age) still live with their parents in HDBs"
12935,Edit: VTL = Very Troublesome Leh!
12936,"In a country with a super-majority that is topped up artificially thru preferential immigration policy, is a system considered broken only when majority are affected by a policy?"
12937,"The worry was that between a Chinese and a more qualified minority candidate, the majority Chinese population would rather vote for the Chinese candidate than the minority candidate because as we all know, racism still exist in Singapore."
12938,"Back in 2019, I got let go from a start up that let me go for racist reasons."
12939,This is not me being racist.
12940,"But people tend to call racism with intent 'racism', and racism without intent 'culturally/racially insensitive', the former having a stronger connotation."
12941,In addition to many great points raised about why this comic is just rubbish; it’s also interesting the introspection of racism is allowed when it’s about the majority ethnicity.
12942,"In addition to racism, and being chinese, I think the gong-beater is also an unpleasant human, nochill asshole, and assholery happens regardless of race and uncurable."
12943,"In always surprised at the way Singaporeans treat their maids and, actually, anyone who can't fight back (horror stories from Grab drivers, service staff etc.)"
12944,I can imagine alot of expats leaving just to keep their spouses happy and busy.
12945,Even if the tenant made a complaint they probably would not be comfortable having an openly racist landlord.
12946,In b4 Sjws say u can’t be racist to Chinese.. 😂
12947,In before CECA bring COVID and steal our jobs comment /s
12948,In before Vietbu come in /s  But I hope more VTL open and eventually VTL end because there is no need to
12949,In before people confusing nationalism with racism.
12950,Nobody wants to mention the fact the recent liberal immigration policy brings in the negatives as well as the positives.
12951,Calling out people being racist when rules are enforced is victim blaming.
12952,In before people start citing this OPINION piece as fact of how singaporean are xenophobic and that our economy will crash and burn.
12953,"Edit: in case some don’t realise, people being let go is not a function of xenophobia."
12954,"If expats earning a lot but not being able to contribute are being fired, that’s the company’s choice, not the choice of the Singaporean community."
12955,"In before:  ""it's not racism/discrimination, it's a preference""  ""maybe they needed people who speak Chinese""  ""it's natural for people to prefer those of the same race, if the employer was Malay/Indian they would have discriminated against Chinese as well so its fair""  ""if you're not happy then go look for a job with a Malay employer""  ""but malays statistically perform less well off in terms of education, you can't fault the employer for not wanting to take the risk""  ""maybe the can't cater to Indian/Malay Muslims because there's no halal food available at work"""
12956,"In case you can't read the heading, racism."
12957,"Sure, you might be too far gone to realise that you're racist, but that doesn't mean that it cannot be a good reminder for anyone else to be CIVIL in their day to day life."
12958,And r/sg has tons of racist comments.
12959,It's just that anyone calling out the racism is routinely downvoted because we're too sensitive to actually examine our behaviour.
12960,But feel free to continue to live in your dreamland where everything is bright and cheery and legitimate grievances must automatically be xenophobic.
12961,Several CEOs were sacked by him..but going so low to attack your domestic helper..seems too much.
12962,In fact them asking whether she's comfy about kissing an Indian is them checking how racist she is.
12963,"And if the production folks were truly racist, they wouldn't consider adding that bit into the script."
12964,And no the majority voted for Brexit so don’t make sure the assumption that most of the UK is not xenophobic or racist.
12965,"She only got out when the helper next door's employers were out, that helper heard the first helper being screamed at and things hitting the wall (after presumably being thrown at her), and called the MOM help line for FDWs (1-800-339-5505 or 6339-5505)."
12966,I don’t understand why US illegal immigrants should be given citizenship just because they’ve been there for a long time
12967,In general I have experienced 'happy racism' like you described all my life.
12968,This was not a 'Happy racism' incident.
12969,"Usually I'll just let them talk for a while and once they get to know me better I'll really gently let it drop that I am Indian, and that I'm uncomfortable with their racist statements."
12970,"I've also encountered a bunch of what I'll call 'indoctrinated racism', such as the statement that Malays should be excluded from the army because their loyalty to Singapore is in question."
12971,"In general, if your skin/ face doesn't look like from south asian country, you won't experience racism here."
12972,"In light of Racial Harmony day recently, and the various conversations about racism, assimilation, cultural awareness etc, I thought I should pen down my thoughts and experience of the burial ceremony of a Malay Muslim in Singapore."
12973,It's like apologising for your racist parent after they melt down in public.
12974,I've travelled widely and yes explicit racism is uncommon.
12975,"Women ""leave"" their maiden homes and ""marry into"" their husbands' families."
12976,"But to be fair, the locals did tend to make fun of their accent, without consequence....again, racist/bigoted beginnings and normalization in school - in this conflict, then the differences between local tamil/chinese/malay/others are ignored, because now the whole class can pick on the one stuck up kid with a funny accent from india."
12977,"* In Secondary school, the North indians (expats) still had the reputation for being stuck up prudes who looked down on the local tamil-speaking population."
12978,"Most of the North Indian expats spoke Hindi/Punjabi, so they didn't have to take Tamil at school, and got to take French/German, etc...so that again gave them the notion of being ever so much better than the lowly locals."
12979,"* Then there were things that just stem from being wealthy, and probably spoilt (so not much to do with ethnicity here) - compared to most locals at my school, the expats were FILTHY rich - one girl I went to school had her wedding ceremony in Singapore, complete with Bollywood style horse-drawn carriage, multiple ceremonies, parents owned most of The Sovereign (not sure if that condo is still around)."
12980,"Once in class, we were asked where we bought shoes - most local students said ""Bata"" or other local sports shops....and the one expat kid said ""Marks and Spencers....""  talking about plain white school shoes here."
12981,"Local indians couldn't give half a shit about the caste system, but it still lingers amongst the indian expats."
12982,"In my experience, Malaysians are more warmly welcomed than any expats of any other citizenship."
12983,In my mind:   “I have not come across a single migrant worker who demanded an apology”   <coffin dance meme>
12984,"You cannot undertake the impossible quest of changing everyone mind in your lifetime, but you can touch the life of some and build a connection with them, and that's where fulfillment is in life, non in condo, car and country club - those normally are very sad people anyhow, let them be ignorant or racist if it needs to be ..."
12985,"The HOD has made remarks such as ""we recognize we need foreign talent to grow"", followed by ""we are no longer confined by the quota"", the first line is fine, to which I agree to some extent, but as a Singaporean, the second remark is extremely disrespectful."
12986,"Don't get me wrong, there are good ones, but the majority of them are terrible, I am all for foreign talent helping Singapore grow, but I fail to see how these people are called talents at all, their resumes are full of exaggeration and lies and they never perform to what is written in their resumes, they talk a lot and make excuses for themselves and for each other."
12987,"In my opinion, the average expat quality has long dropped and far cry from the past."
12988,I am talking about expats from western countries in case people are thinking about countries like nearby Asia.
12989,These average expat also command salaries of 7 k and above.
12990,"But based on basic maths, indeed average SG is no where measurable against average expats, however these roles were never meant for the average folks."
12991,"I’m a minority myself and I have experienced casual racism here, although nothing ever compared to what’s happening there and I will continue to share the injustice that is happening."
12992,"In my original post, the point was giving them more space per room in a realistic scenario, which should be done by the way, *would not have prevented a dormitory cluster."
12993,*  Your point here is army dorm is more livable compared to fw dormitory.
12994,We reduce 1/5 men from every room that's really cramped and expand the dormitory.
12995,"If they are using covid as an argument for better living conditions, no, it would not have prevented dormitory clusters on the whole."
12996,This was a compromise I left open in my original argument that no one took up because they were too busy trying to pin the entire FW dormitory outbreak on the corporations.
12997,Do they not enforce this ban / ticket riders because 90% of them are white expats?
12998,Saying this as an expat who's tired of near misses.
12999,"In my short times in Australia I’ve never experienced any sort of racism, being an ethnically ambiguous person myself."
13000,But I’ve experienced quite a bit of racism here in my “home” country.
13001,"Rather, the dissatisfaction with CECA is a symptom of a larger problem related to disillusionment and class issues."
13002,CECA and foreigners are an easy target to lash out against when there is deep rooted dissatisfaction with one's position in life and when there is perceived inequity.
13003,"If the government is smart, the REAL challenge is not to convince people about the merits and myths of CECA, it is to diagnose the underlying root causes of dissatisfaction and fix the social contract which binds society."
13004,"If they get detracted and think that it is purely ""xenophobia"" or ""racism"" and attempt to solve it by branding people against CECA as that, then we will only see a more divided society."
13005,What majority of expats really want is travel around the region.
13006,"In other Singapore racism news, you are still legally allowed to discriminate against housing and employment applicants based on race."
13007,"In other news, maid agencies in Singapore stop recruiting from Indonesia and double their recruitment from Philippines and Myanmar"
13008,"In other words, it's not so much on reforming and reeducation of racist opinions as much as just beat them into submission/drive them out of sight."
13009,"In response to a Stomp query, a spokesman for MOM said: ""Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, foreign domestic workers (FDWs) should be deployed to perform only domestic chores."
13010,"""MOM has looked into the incident, and has advised the FDW employer and the FDW accordingly."""
13011,In short just a bit of nothingness in the article...talking about the sovereign lady and the incidents which they didnt take appropriate action and got called out for it...some altercation/racism incidents which DID NOT happen in singapore.
13012,Just tryna gain some points on how against racism/discrimination pap is and bunch of nothing really.
13013,"In short, the VTL allows you to avoid SHN but at the risk of having to stay in Germany for at least 21 days more if you test positive pre-departure."
13014,"In singapore, I felt many employers have this mindset of wanting to have a strict control of their maid."
13015,"As they have put in huge investment in hiring a maid and retaining them to a point of wanting to isolate the maid from the sociality to prevent them from getting ""bad influence""."
13016,I have a friend who was unhappy when their maid make new friend with other maid around the neighbourhood and was considering withholding their passport from them.
13017,An expats life here is just more expensive.
13018,"So if you want an expat, you'll need to factor those things in."
13019,You can't change who a person like/love just by screaming at them repeatedly that they are racist.
13020,"As for measurable metrics for racism, there are very few available but one would imagine they follow a similar trajectory."
13021,And the person you are replying to is right in stating there would be some pretty stiff economic consequences for driving away a lot of immigrants from Singapore.
13022,Not very sure what Singaporeans receive in benefits compared to expats because I've never not been a Singaporean!
13023,"If anyone is dumb and weak-willed enough to be a racist bigot just from the hate-filled rant of one person, well there are bigger problems at hand right?"
13024,"In that case, this reasoning should be applicable to all racists and we should sympathize with them instead."
13025,"Those immigrants were usually the able people in China, usually with decent job."
13026,In the Internet age I don’t really see the point of the expat system’s existence.
13027,"My fiancé is currently living in Singapore, and she worries about racism when she settles here."
13028,"If a lawyer can show that the the pool of rejected and accepted tenants by say a property agency wildly deviated from the racial balance of prospective tenants in Singapore, then the burden of proof fall on the property agency to demonstrate that this imbalance does not arise from racism and that they did everything they could to mitigate the racial imbalance."
13029,"While the police and government there are shielded from a lot of civil litigation and thus can be pretty racist, the private sector in the US has had a lot of the racism stamped out by this practice and is much better.--Especially compared to a lot of the rest of the world."
13030,Thats the same as me saying that xenophobia/tensions have actually decreased amongst singaporeans cause when we were masks we cant see properly cause my spectacles fog up and cant see colour.
13031,"Sure, there are other contexts where xenophobia can be discussed in the wider definition, but this thread is not one of them."
13032,"If we really want to discuss xenophobia across all in and out groups, then we would also be discussing issues of racism in Singapore between majority Chinese and minority groups, we can discuss LGBT issues in Singapore, we can discuss how we treat the poor, as well."
13033,In the current status the VTL is a huge amount of work.
13034,A friend was at raffles marina bay for testing and waited 2 hours as a VTL.
13035,"These kind of soft factors might *(or might not)* have long term ramifications that are hard to evaluate now, but the simple fact that this bad press started coming out has worried PM Lee enough to mention the FT article in his most recent speech; incidentally in the same speech he mentioned the failures of some Japanese closed/xenophobic mindset in global business."
13036,"And in the case of casual racism, in the end people who do this are still treating an entire race like a joke."
13037,"In the end, it's likely the homesickness that's driving expats to leave, more every other restriction combined."
13038,"While all of them are stifling, it's the restrictions to travel, and the emotional toll it imposes on expats being separated from their families, that are hitting hardest."
13039,So she cld still be racist as the victim was an indian.
13040,"In the same vein, if you think it's stupid then deal with the xenophobia ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  It happens everywhere all over the world where the government is unable to prioritize their citizens over foreigners: Australia, UK, US, Singapore."
13041,I'm only helping you put into perspective why some locals are xenophobic from a local perspective.
13042,"There's racism in Singapore for sure, but our police officers don't go around shooting minorities out for a evening jog."
13043,"Not to belittle the racism faced by minorities in Singapore, but being able to complain about racist *remarks* is a privilege that many African-Americans, especially those who have lost family members to police shootings, would love to have."
13044,"Like you've also mentioned, many of the racist remarks faced by Black people in Singapore stem from ignorance rather than malice."
13045,In this case I wouldn't assume the daughter had racist intent.
13046,Later people say racist.
13047,"In this midst of the novel coronavirus spreading around the world, there seems to be a certain narrative around some commenters in this sub and even from the health minister himself, that somehow Singaporeans are revealing their xenophobic tendencies when reacting to the outbreak."
13048,It is not xenophobic to suggest that Singapore should consider a travel ban on China or other more drastic quarantine measures.
13049,"We can do a cost-benefit analysis another day, but we cannot deny this is one of the drawbacks an open immigration policy will incur."
13050,It is not racist to condemn people who partake and endorse the culture of eating 野味.
13051,"So please, the next time before you start making xenophobic claims, remember that just because you’re healthy and strong and can likely resist the virus, does not mean you can invalidate the concerns of those who have a weaker immune system, painting all their concerns, worries, suggestions in the same brush as xenophobia and overreactions, because these are the people who have a genuine cause for concern."
13052,"While it is almost never publicised in the news, racism is prevalent in Singapore."
13053,It is sad in so many cases where foreign workers are abused and taken advantage of simply for being from another country and having cultural differences.
13054,We should all be thankful to foreign workers for their hard work and treat them with the same respect you would to your own friends and family.
13055,I am glad that the government is putting in their best efforts to support foreign workers through this difficult time.
13056,"In today’s ST article, ”A questioning of inequities: The legacy of Covid-19”, Ho Kwon Ping suggested to “reduce the absolute numbers while changing the mix of foreign workers from low-cost, low-skill to higher-cost, higher-skill.”      He went on to say that it would not be possible if “native-born Singaporeans do not want o undertake high-skilled, high-paid vocational careers, unlike their counterparts in developed countries such as Germany and Australia.”  What are some examples of these high-skilled, high-paid vocational careers in Singapore and what’s the best pathway to it."
13057,Right now I still have every intention of traveling but depends on what SG government decides with VTL changes or new quarantine rules and how worth it it will be to go the UK if it’s going into lockdown.
13058,"My new foreign domestic worker (FDW) from Philippines, arrived on 01May."
13059,"Additional 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated facilities (SDF)  Your FDW who entered Singapore from 24 Apr 2021 must  Serve an additional 7-day SHN at the SDF Take another COVID-19 swab test at the SDF before her 7-day SHN is over  A bill for additional 7 days and test will be emailed to the person who submitted the entry application within a month of the FDW’s arrival in Singapore."""
13060,"Not being understood by ""the locals"" is a common complaint of British expats."
13061,In what way do you think you are racist?
13062,In which case it would appear that the flight differentiated measures are basically to discourage SCs /PRs  from travelling since they would not have to apply for VTP but wld be subject to quarantine if they are not on a VTL flight.
13063,In which countries can the spouse of a foreign worker work?
13064,"In which world does she think this is not racist, hmmmmmmm???"
13065,"All that does is slowly turn people into actual racists because it forces them into a lose-lose: Silently endure the negative effects, or get labelled a racist."
13066,"Sweeping truthful negative racial stereotypes under the carpet because ""that's a racist stereotype"" does more harm than good even though it may feel like the right thing to say and do."
13067,"In your original comment you said that the immigrant is the entitled one, if he is coming here and expecting to be hired over a local person."
13068,"If both are equally qualified, why prioritise the local guy over the immigrant?"
13069,"The fundamental reason, I believe is plain old racism and intolerance."
13070,But racism against minorities has been around much longer than that.
13071,"In your pathetic attempt to shoehorn your latent racism, you don’t seem to process that OP may have a professional capacity to make his statements  https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/asn59x/why_do_maid_employers_have_this_much_control_over/egvvf57"
13072,"Inb4 ""minority race cannot be racist!"""
13073,"Inb4 it is okay because japanese people not brown ppl, so it’s ok to be racist towards them  Brown ppl/blacks can be victims of racism, but not everyone else"
13074,Inb4 minorities cannot be racist.
13075,Inb4 the xenophobic comments
13076,Incentives aren't a prerequisite for racism.
13077,Incidental racism
13078,"Incompetence isn’t malice, but racism can be unintentional."
13079,"I don’t think framing this incident as racist is necessarily helpful, because of the way we usually think of racism, but it’s not wrong."
13080,Increased sensitivity due to increased racism
13081,"Mind you, the maid in question was only 24 years old living in a shitty household."
13082,"Just goes to show you how shitty a situation many domestic workers have to face every day - the gross underpay, the overwork, the physical/verbal abuse, the unfair justice system."
13083,I doubt many of the people hating on expats for not integrating are thoroughly integrated with e.g.
13084,"Look, I really feel for the mixed-race couple who got verbally abused by the racist poly lecturer, and the racist gong woman crossed the line by mocking another's religion."
13085,"But this PA incident is not racism, but a function of PA's incompetence."
13086,"By indulging in identity politics and milking the incident for something that isn't racism, Sarah B has in fact alienated segments of the population."
13087,"Indeed, this thread reeks of populism and thinly veiled xenophobia."
13088,"Indeed, would be extra sad if they are the same who cried foul to ""Stop Asian Hate"" when racism-related acts against Asian Americans happened in the US/Europe countries."
13089,The comparison is obviously used in context of “*the other region might actually have less racism compared to what you’re used to*” instead of the blame-shifting that whataboutism is all about.
13090,Neither is my point to TS to suggest that having a language test is wrong or right.
13091,So if you bin all the expats out of Singapore that are willing to splurge on these things then all those businesses owned and operated by Singaporeans are going to go with them.
13092,People here seem to think if we kick out every expat they'll just be replaced by Singaporeans.
13093,"Without this incident it would have been brushed off as “why minorities so sensitive” and “this is not racism, it is just cultural insensitivity”."
13094,Indentured servitude and an inability to empathise with maids as humans with their own want and needs.
13095,"Recently, because of the large influx and their visual presence the visceral racism against them has gone up especially in online spaces like FB and edmw where these discussion about issues like immigration and jobs going to foreign workers (or talents) are moving dangerously towards the right."
13096,"For Singapore to stay competitive in these industries, the influx of foreign workers is here to stay."
13097,"To pit the presence of foreign workers in Singapore as a zero sum game where by a foreigner is earning at the loss of a Singaporean, is a fallacy."
13098,Obvious racism.
13099,It’s a bit sad that you associate something so wonderful with being derogatory just because some racist assholes use “curry muncher” as an insult.
13100,Don’t let the racists win.
13101,Its the expat Indians bringing their class divide and preference for hiring their own countrymen which led to tensions in the community.
13102,If you have a business park with 90% visible Indian expats what would Singaporeans think?
13103,Next time a Chinese person says a racist thing to me imma just call them out.
13104,The only racism I've experienced coming from Singaporeans is in Counter Strike servers.
13105,1) I personally have not faced any racism at the school and I have friends with the local Singaporeans in my class.
13106,But I think latent racism is there.
13107,"Have experienced individual instances of racism, but never was it systemic or institutionalised."
13108,"Two RL examples: A quite racist chappie/chappette who freely uses casual slurs like “keleng” or ""munjen” (as inappropriate), but would listen to medical advice given by a cardiologist/nephrologist/etc from said race."
13109,Indians and racism
13110,The last iteration of CECA had clauses that allow for work permits for certain industry relaxed.
13111,How is that racist?
13112,"Indians generally have stronger smell and use scented products, which racist people find smelly."
13113,"Individuals in position of authority or power can do racist things, no doubt, but they cant do it openly as if its legal if its not in the laws."
13114,Many countries with racist laws can and the result is very horrible.
13115,Indo or pinoy maids?
13116,"Yes bring a lot of benefits to job opportunities but I don't think it is for everyone by making it compulsory, especially when many still struggle with their mother tongue."
13117,Indonesia also set minimum salary for maids to $550  Filipino maid minimum salary is $650  Myanmar maids are paid less than both.
13118,Still won't stop unscrupulous employers from deducting the FDW levy ($265/month) from the maid's salary anyway.
13119,Perhaps there's a VTL to Bali/Batam/Bintan in the works?
13120,Indonesian domestic workers will find it harder to find jobs overseas
13121,Indonesian: 2 kg of any non english speaking maid.
13122,Innate racism is called tribalism.
13123,"Not only jail time, but they should be banned from hiring FDWs too!"
13124,How is this not racist.
13125,Otherwise you can take pictures / videos of the maid / neighbor letting their dog poop in front of your house and call NEA.
13126,"Locally, I do wonder if more people WFH contributes to the expats feeling that they are no longer welcome, as colleagues do not physically see each other nowadays?"
13127,"Instead of cancelling the racist in schools and workplaces, this makchik go cancel a monthly waged employee cos of waffles?"
13128,Instead of removing VTLs they talk of expanding the programme.
13129,I worked a lot with indonesian foreign domestic worker and most of them are on good hand with their employers.
13130,"Instead of trying to appease the people with data, the G merely accused us of being racist, turning the fire back on us."
13131,"Institutionalised racism exists, in the form of employment opportunities and some may argue, our certain government bodies, aka SAF (?)."
13132,"I don't think institutionalised racism is as big of a problem than in other countries, im thinking Malaysia and the US off the top of my head."
13133,Insult Chinese maybe its not racism charge.
13134,Intent is not necessary for racism.
13135,"InterNations is a community for expats, and I signed up for it many years when I was new to Singapore."
13136,Interested to find out in what ways are we racist to one another.
13137,"I want to be clear, I’m not fear-mongering or trying to be racist/uneducated/unfair."
13138,The focus of the xenophobic anger now is on Indian nationals and purely as an economic issue (not a social one)
13139,"No mandarin as lingua franca, no penalty for someone cussing on Chinese, too many non-Chinese in the top (not representative)  Malay - Gov is Chinese pro, and all rules are anti-Malay like no hair rays meetups, no home baking   Indians - Majority can make stereotyping or xenophobic calls or continuously prove that they are not from India because of different skin colour, they are neither majority or get any special rights  Others - SG only takes care of CMI and not Others."
13140,But one thing common for all CMIO - It's all PAP fault.
13141,It’s no question that Singaporeans lack certain skills and attitudes that expats can bring to fill the gap.
13142,The expats that chose to leave behind their homes and come here are obviously the ones who most likely can adapt to new environments.
13143,"Whereas the Singaporeans who have similar attributes are not likely to be in Singapore anymore, and have similarly chosen the expat route in other countries."
13144,"Interesting story, sister once tutored the kid of Pakistani expats who requested for “Chinese female tutors only”..."
13145,Just because he was a higher ranking army officer he is immune to repercussions for such overt racism?
13146,"I heard, not sure if true, that it is cheaper to hire a maid than to pay for a nursing home?"
13147,"Interesting, I'm an expat in Wellington!"
13148,I think it is important to recognise and call out racism.
13149,"But, it is equally important to be careful about not overextending its definition and suggest other issues as racist."
13150,"I believe it is unfair to those being wrongfully suggested as racist, and it may even hurt the cause to eliminate racial discrimination."
13151,I am getting a call a week from headhunters looking to kick an expat out and replace him with a local or local+ to save costs.
13152,"I based my assumption on the observation that many of the same racist/ xenophobic commenters are also the ones who start threads on breaking local news/ rumors, and I think it would be very unlikely that people with such 'on-the-ground' information are not in Singapore."
13153,There’s a Facebook group slammed full of expats who are stuck outside too.
13154,"As you rightly said about Singaporean Chinese, most are polite (may be rigid) and don't show racist attitudes."
13155,"May be that's why, u didn't get racist attitudes."
13156,So were you given a choice for your mother tongue?
13157,International schools and the placement process of foreigners in local schools are designed to breed xenophobia and prevent true integration.
13158,Accommodation: it’s going to be hard as an expat unless you’re willing to dish out a bit more cash.
13159,":)  Singaporeans are not supposed to be overtly xenophobic, but the rate of immigrant influx is too fast in the past 6 years or so."
13160,"I dont think it is right to call that resulting feeling, xenophobia."
13161,Introduced due to racism and maintained by a certain religious group.
13162,"Investments will divert towards other countries as well, but yeah that's a different story, nothing to do with any perceived xenophobia, just what's optimum business strategy."
13163,"Tbf the xenophobic line was a very small part of his long post, and as I said in my main response on this topic, even most expats in my experience to do not think ""SG first"" hiring policies are xenophobic in any way."
13164,"Some behaviour like the viral LinkedIn profiles post is definitely xenophobic no offence, but not the SG first prioritization"
13165,"Ironic that this subreddit is acting like they haven’t been xenophobic themselves in the past, Im pretty sure there’s people lurking here that would’ve liked those comments or worst still added on to it."
13166,"Ironic they claim we are racist then turn around and yell that asians are all racist, thus being racist themselves"
13167,I’m sorry but you cannot tell locals (who are subject to the full cost of living locally) that they must suck it up and compete with foreign workers (who can return to home countries with lower cost of living).
13168,"In fact, access to foreign workers is regulated by the G. Having said that, competing with them is high asymmetrical since they don’t have to live, breed and settle here."
13169,"Many are fond of the CCP they, cheer when they do authoritarian things and they are keen consumers of extremist revanchist chinese ethno-nationalist racist ideas.--yet they are intensely bigoted to our PRC new citizens."
13170,"The despise of liberal democracy and pluralism, the worship of authority and an obsession with government displays of strength also breeds contempt fear and suspicion of immigrants."
13171,"Before immigrants, it was the commies, the poor, the weak or the different."
13172,"There is a profound, condescending racism and sexism on the far left."
13173,"If those expats are not deported, the authorities can also be labelled as racists for revoking the work passes of brown foreign workers and not the EPs of white foreign workers."
13174,Edit: white foreign workers.
13175,"Ironically, blaming this entirely on 'white supremacy' is just as xenophobic..."
13176,"Try raising an issue about racial privilege, and invariably someone will say ""aren't you being racist to Chinese people""."
13177,"Irony being these black people from United States are grateful for living in an Asian country with locals that’s not racist at all towards them, but yet Asian people living in the United States mostly encounter racism attacks, be it verbal or even extremely physical… from blacks."
13178,Is Singapore a fairly racist place?
13179,"I'm half-Chinese/half-White, so I'd doubt that I'd be a victim of racism (maybe), but what about other people, like Indians, or Malaysians, black people, or white people?"
13180,"Singapore seems like an interesting place, but I'd much rather not visit if it's a racist cesspool."
13181,"Quarantine at dormitory or at home doesn't work, that's the hard-learned lesson when Wuhan was in lock-down."
13182,"Training, pass IPPT, RT, defaulters parade, fines, passing shooting, travel restrictions and documentation when they give you last minute call up."
13183,Is a sense of superiority and condescension over others racism?
13184,Is anyone else really bloody worried about the foreign worker dorms?
13185,Is calling someone yellow racist too?
13186,"Is casual racism or systemic racism, racism?"
13187,"Since there's no intent, there's no racism?"
13188,"Should I go around calling chinese ching chong, and claim that I'm not racist cause I got no intent to be racist?"
13189,Is it a mandatory 'mother tongue' or a mandatory 'official second language'?
13190,I seriously womder if a person from Russia gets ro learn Russian as a 'mother tongue'.
13191,"Sorry I'm ignorant and incompetent, not racist."
13192,"Most maids have phones paid for by their employers, so strictly speaking it's a company phone."
13193,Is it actually possible to fully weed out racism tho?
13194,Is it common for people to get their maids to wash their cars everyday?
13195,"I thought the maids job is to clean the household, which doesnt include the vehicles, thats what the car wash, or self serve car wash center is for."
13196,"Is it conflict between foreign talent and foreign workers, or conflict between one/both groups and locals?"
13197,"You could talk about the Little India incident last year, or online xenophobia, or how pressure in the last elections have made it more difficult for foreign talent to get work passes, etc."
13198,Is it difficult for Singaporeans to be an expat overseas?
13199,"With the education background you received in Singapore, I'm pretty sure many Western nations welcome Singaporean expats."
13200,this is by far a much much smaller issue that the injustice maids here are subject to.
13201,Is it fair that immigrants are allowed to roam freely when Singaporean born otters are confined to ~~Tekong~~ the zoo?
13202,"Yet, have not heard much consequence given to companies handling these foreign workers especially with the dorm mess from the beginning of COVID and then recent deaths from lorry accidents."
13203,Why can't they fine and force these foreign worker employers to fork out the money for safety of their own employers?
13204,I get the humanitarian cost of the gov having to step in and using taxpayer money to help the foreign workers but the employers must be held liable and bled dry first before having the tax payers settle their mess.
13205,Is it legal for an employer to stop a maid from going to JB on her day off?
13206,Is it legal for employers to demand FDW passports in the first place?
13207,Is it normal for the husband to have feelings for the domestic helper?
13208,Is it normal in singapore for maids to wash elderly people?
13209,Downvote me you racist fucks
13210,I also see plenty of maids stealing from their employers so busy socializing and browsing on their damned phones during their official work hours.
13211,Is it possible that you can't explain it properly because you don't actually have a reasonable argument that the thing is racist?
13212,"Is it possible to pre-book flight and ""change"" it into a VTL flight?"
13213,Anyone know of how to book a VTL Flight?
13214,Is it racism if he stated based on his observation and statistics?
13215,Is it racism if they are the same race?
13216,Is it racist to call white people ang mohs?
13217,Is it racist to not like the smell of curry?
13218,Is it racist to say that the country is not ready for a non chinese PM?
13219,Is it racist to have a reserved race presidency?
13220,Other ministries are involved and migrant workers would fall under our beloved Jo Teo's portfolio.
13221,"It's not even a case of ""we need these workers"" as the recent community cases are Indian PMET who are somehow freely flying back and forth, not the migrant workers who we need for construction work."
13222,Is it really because Singapore is trying to limit the number of foreign worker?
13223,Is it really too much to ask the person who hired the maid to provide that assistance (probably to a member of their own family) for one day a week?
13224,"*edit - I was curious so I went to dig it up again - [here](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/cop2010/census_2010_release2/indicators.pdf)  - saying that malays have lower education, income is not racism, it's a fact."
13225,"Maybe a bit difficult to prosecute, but it’s worth at least reporting to prove a trend in this racist’s behaviour if it every escalated further."
13226,Would any other country with migrant workers like us do the same?
13227,"Now, do I think maids rights should be protected?"
13228,"I'm generally against the death penalty but even then I feel like the sad part of this story is the senseless death of the young maid, not the execution of her murderer."
13229,Is prosecuting netizens for making racist remarks online going to make them not racist?
13230,"My reading of this is thru are questioning the loss of jobs to CECA, not immigration."
13231,"Is racism illegal, or racial discrimination illegal?"
13232,And does Singapore do any better with its approach to migrant workers?
13233,There are so many foreign workers and foreign domestic workers being exploited in Singapore every day.
13234,Mediacorp even managed to cement this ridiculous caricature of the Filipino domestic worker through its Leticia character on the Noose.
13235,Is racism solely defined by acts only?
13236,"Do you not see how cultural insensitivity from a top-down level is dangerous for our society precisely due to the amount of racist attitudes it breeds and has brought out into the open, with all sorts of people now gatekeeping what racism is, including yourself?"
13237,"Sure, if you want to be pedantic about it, the PA did not do anything that can be considered strictly racist."
13238,"So yes, the PA is not “racist”."
13239,But this incident has showed that the PA are many things that are worse than being “racist”.
13240,"So it is not a stretch to suggest that perhaps some of the comments and actions made by the PA (a government stat board) thus far come as a result of racial prejudices, or of systemic racial ignorance, and are incubators for racist attitudes and acts for society as a whole."
13241,"There are so many authentic Indian restaurants in Australia that serve thosai, thanks to the large number of Indian immigrants there."
13242,Is she still allowed to hire a maid?
13243,Is she using her experience in Australia as an example of racism in Asia?
13244,"In the post you were responding to, you challenged the notion that Singapore would become a transmission hub(I argued with the lack of travel restrictions, Singapore will inevitably become a transmission hub and urged immediate travel restrictions) and reaffirmed the decisions made by the government at the time."
13245,"You are implying the travel restrictions have had little or close to impact on limiting the spread, constantly arguing that ""other methods"" suffice."
13246,"So yes, please tell us more, about how intolerant and racist Singapore is."
13247,Legit question - does this count as systemic racism?
13248,Redditors' speculation appeared even before the government's intervention in imposing the travel restriction.
13249,Redditors' speculation appeared even before the government's intervention in imposing the travel restriction.
13250,Is the maid nuts  The last part there also nowhere to stand she still try to cross over
13251,Is the recently recovered part only applicable to VTL flights or for all flights into Singapore?
13252,Had COVID in December....meant to travel on a non VTL flight tomorrow morning and that would save me 10 days SHN!
13253,Is there a non- racist way of asking why go we only see bangladedhi men and not women?
13254,The country that has real racial issues that we are importing influence from is the US where they have had institutionalized racism against blacks and continue to have racial issues all the way since the founding fathers.
13255,"Not saying there aren't any racists, but it's not systemic, it's not general and it's not critical."
13256,Is there such a thing as Singapore-born and raised domestic helpers or are they all brought in from other countries?
13257,"The non-racist landlords aren't going to rent to ""Indians only"", they are going to rent to everyone."
13258,Just relabel all grievances as incidents of racism in hopes that we get heard?
13259,Because I've heard this type of justification from my privileged friends as well when I asked them why their family treats their domestic helper like that.
13260,"To me, it doesn't seem like a healthy way of thinking.. Are people in Singapore generally fine with this racist way of conducting business?"
13261,Every minor slight would be attributed to racism
13262,But some of points that article write about is a bit stupid and make it as if the government and general populace hated foreign worker populace.
13263,Do you really think Singapore can claim they are racially unbiased or not racist towards Indians?
13264,Is your maid a pinay?
13265,"Isn't all workpass holders locked up in country, except those whose Govt negotiated VTL.."
13266,Isn't separating Local community cases and dorm cases some kind of racism as well?
13267,I do not think maids here are treated like that.
13268,"Hmm.. besides the reports in the newspapers of maids being mistreated, there are a lot of cases where lots of maids in Singapore who have a good working relationship with their employers in Singapore (with or without days off)."
13269,There are certain maids with days off and certain maids without.
13270,"For example, I too can say that reading some of the comments on the thread that OP has linked along with comments on EDMW and some of the house rental advertisements, Singaporeans are extremely racist especially if I am an Indian and have not done anything I am accused of doing and yet, this is what I have experienced."
13271,Isn't that the very definition of racism?
13272,Isn't the Malay woman racist for making it a race thing?
13273,Isn't it kind of racist to restrict to Nepalese?
13274,Isn't the whole argument against Chinese required rooted in racism and discrimanation?
13275,"Also, expat package includes rent, school fees and whatnot right?"
13276,"From my experience, ""expat package"" isn't as common anymore so we tend to remember outliers."
13277,Isn't your mother tongue English if you can't speak mandarin.
13278,"Singaporean Chinese were from immigrants who used to be in southern China, speaking languages that are mutually unintelligible which are totally different from mandarin which is derived Beijing Dialect."
13279,Isnt that's xenophobic rather than racism?
13280,"Stop this senseless mass immigration, it seems like almost anyone can get an employment pass these days."
13281,Issit racist Chinese eat rice?
13282,"If you do eat rice, do you think it's racist?"
13283,"If you don't eat rice considering the percentage of Chinese who do eat rice, do you still think it's racist?"
13284,There are people who experience racism and there are people who look for racism.
13285,hence our reliance on foreign workers
13286,Low-key Discrimination/racism runs rampant here lets hope a movement can start to fix it.
13287,Overt racism is extremely rare.
13288,Edit : There is a 'Training Employment Pass' (TEP) as well as a temporary employment pass.
13289,It IS maid abuse and you could do the maid a favour by reporting the abuse.
13290,"Unless it’s the first situation, racism almost certainly had a hand in this."
13291,And foreign workers are right at the bottom of the heap.
13292,Anything that will lead to increased cost of living (such as improved conditions for foreign workers) is a vote loser because the average Singaporean doesn’t care about anything except their own interests.
13293,"It boggles my mind because being ""insensitive to race"" is being racist!"
13294,"Certainly to an American, the kind of non-PC jokes and stereotyping that goes on all the time around here count as racism."
13295,"Singapore doesn't have so much ""hard racism"" (as in stuff that leads to violence or illegal stuff), but there sure is a ton of ""soft racism""."
13296,"I'm not pretending i can cure racism, and i have many problems of my own that just add obstacles like not being an effective communicator or go overboard and get stuck into an immature cesspit of a thread, etc but I at least attempt to try and help by raising the matter just like you did."
13297,Either because she is a foreigner or because she is a maid.
13298,"I bet you that while they were carrying out the abuse they were patting themselves on the back for giving this maid such a ""high"" salary."
13299,"Even when people go overseas to work for mid-term, there are people forming groups within their own nationality or cities or even township to stay in the same sharehouse/apartments, it's more to minimize cultural/communicative friction with housemates over being racist."
13300,I am sure there are many racists landlords who does it because of race.
13301,"But generally, racism here definitely is on the milder side compared to other countries"
13302,"It depends if they are paid ""expat"" packages or more in line with local pay rates."
13303,"Also, there is a huge difference between western ""expats"" and asian ""expats""."
13304,It depends on if there was actually a racist act committed.
13305,It depends on the 'type' of migrant worker they are.
13306,I recall one of the Town Council's mentioning their migrant workers stay in flats or something.
13307,"This doesn't mean there's no racism or people saying ""go back to your home"", but the government in general takes care of your safety."
13308,"There's not much recourse in the former - you have to put it up to a higher authority (assuming your friend works in an MNC), or catch the person in question in the act saying racist shit (if you know he's definitely not that kind to be racist for just once, and people aren't usually just 'temporarily racist')."
13309,If you don't want to be with other races because of some racial stereotype then you racist ah.
13310,"Our national language doesn't change, and doesn't need to change, because English is one of the official languages (alongside other mother tongue languages) used for standardized communication."
13311,It does matter if you transit in a non-VTL country and stay in the VTL country less than 14 days…
13312,"Singapore is a small country that wants to play a Global Role, and can only play it with a good team work of foreign talents and local people."
13313,"Helping students choosing the right path it is also a very important thing, and it will drive a rebalance local/expat in certain roles (IT for example)."
13314,Same as blocking off lawns where maids used to hang out on their day off
13315,"We're then faced with the question: is it racism if your issue is with the smell and not the race, just that due to their preferred diet, Indians are the ones mostly carrying that smell around?"
13316,"If it's actually a fact, should we still label it as a racist thing?"
13317,"It does, but many commenters seem to agree with me that the outside world is far less racist than the xenophobes fear it to be (despite the obvious selection bias in this thread)."
13318,"With regards to foreign workers, the biggest issue is the poor enforcement of policies by MOM."
13319,"The lack of proper safety nets for wronged foreign workers is a rights issue IMO, and writing to your MP or providing feedback to MOM would provide the PAP with much needed impetus to dutifully address these issues."
13320,"It doesn't look good for millenials, and even foreigners who work here treat maids like shit."
13321,"It doesn't matter where you go, there will always be xenophobic or racist ""natives"" who will gladly rip into foreigners based on actual or perceived threats."
13322,I am from India and we have a massive problem of racism against North East Indians (who have an East Asian look).
13323,"If a racist Indian national comes to Singapore, the person becomes a minority in Singapore, but is still a racist."
13324,And CMIO plays a critical role in enabling this policy because it puts people into neat little boxes.
13325,"It failed anyway; young Singaporeans barely know their mother tongue and thus for this they have a huge inferiority complex for their own culture, as evidence by this post."
13326,"It feels like local students are increasingly struggling with being bilingual, let alone multi-lingual, so I don’t think they *should* have to learn another language on top of English and their respective mother tongues."
13327,"Plenty of cases where employers abuse maids, but sometimes it is the other way too."
13328,"It happened on the train, was headed towards orchard and some Indians boarded the train, these guys seems to be tourists from North India (Light brown skin, well dressed) but this guy, looked at them with disgust and said to his wife in Mandarin, ""Hen Zang (Very dirty)"" I cannot think of anything more racist than his comment and expression."
13329,It happens alot on /Singapore and on comments pointing out racism.
13330,"My guess, a certain race or group that doesn't believe racism exists in Singapore."
13331,"But it happens over and over again for as long as Singapore has been a nation (and more) and then you start to question if it really isn't ""I don't really care about your culture or your people"" - aka racial prejudice aka racism."
13332,"As long as there is a dominant race, there will be xenophobia, racism and prejudice."
13333,It hit me how fucking sad the state of affairs is in regards to racism when I was on the MRT back home with my two Singaporean Indian friends from my ITE days.
13334,"Later found out from one of them that they don't dare to sit down because they fear that the person sitting next to them will stand up and move to another seat, despite them not having the stereotypical scent that racists like to attach to people of Indian ethnicity."
13335,The amount of subtle racism that you guys face on a daily basis is fucking disgusting.
13336,Sadly we don't live in that reality - the xenophobia you see here is probably already more toned down compared to the rest of SG.
13337,It horrifies me that such racists are just prevalent everywhere :(
13338,"Pretty sure if Singaporeans working in a MNC have to relocate to another country as expats, their total package will also be jacked to proportionally."
13339,"It is 'racist', in the sense of believing that different races have different inclinations and proclivities."
13340,It’s clear this article refers to the bulk of the Chinese Singaporeans when referring to “mother tongues”.
13341,"It does not refer to minority of Mandarin natives and other ethnic groups, those whose mother tongues aren’t being erased."
13342,"It is a different type of racism, more like a ""look at that exotic person!"""
13343,kind of racism.
13344,But it's not because Singaporeans are inherently less racist; it's simply because black people in Singapore are not associated with low SES and crime.
13345,"Most are expected to be well-paid expats or law-abiding US military personnel, maybe the occasional soccer player."
13346,It is a right as a maid...
13347,I think employers should rethink about hiring maids.
13348,"Your domestic helper can manage household chores during working hours and if there are medical needs, that should be covered by a visiting nurse."
13349,It is against policy to issue employment passes for jobs that can be done by Singaporeans who are willing to do it.
13350,These riots are going to add incredible fuel to the large number of racists and xenophobes in this country.
13351,Most people will just chalk it down to this being the way of those dirty foreign workers.
13352,I just hope people see the reasons behind this rather than use it as an excuse for more racism.
13353,I am hopeful but I have a sinking feeling people are just going to be racist as we've seen for much more minor matters.
13354,Indians are also racist against Indians.
13355,"They employer may not have hit the maid, but she wasn't treating the maid as a proper human being either."
13356,Is it so difficult to give the maid some compassion?
13357,"She wants a foreign maid, she has to be prepared that sometimes, they can't speak English yet."
13358,"Also, if the agent lied saying the maid CAN speak English and the employer finds out that its not true, she can always send the maid back to the agency."
13359,I'm sure she can spare substantial meals for her maid.
13360,"The maid has already been threatened and treated like shit, do you think she would dare to ask for more food?"
13361,"You have rightly identified that being angry about it and putting up a fight against racism is pointless and a waste of energy (If anyone don't believe me, just go search around and see how many ""racism debates/call outs"" go anywhere or worse, ends up escalating into a shouting or physical match), you transcend racism by not being a racist yourself, refusing to engage with racists and doing what you said above and setting an example for anyone who wishes to follow, not moral kidnapping or virtue signalling."
13362,"It is easier to throw around sound bites like ""SAP school = institutionalised racism like the bumiputra policy!!!"""
13363,than to actually read the fine print of what both entail respectively  You want to know what is institutionalised racism?
13364,The bumiputra policy IS institutionalised racism.
13365,"It is easy to label them 'xenophobic', but from most of the analysis of UK politics, the central problem in the UK (similar to SG pre-2011 GE) is that for many decades, the popular perception was that the government sitting in London sat on their laurels and didn't do anything substantial to improve conditions in many parts of rural England - especially after Thatcher did her thing."
13366,It is employer's responsibility in Singapore to ensure foreign workers have proper residence.
13367,"Either way, it isn't as bad as being racist."
13368,"The problem here isn't that the bully was obviously indian, it was that the only indian in the entire book was a bully, and was referred to with various racist caricature, such as curly/oily hair and bad smell."
13369,It is high time maid agencies take some responsibilities for maids they recommend to potential employers.
13370,"http://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-pass-general/can-an-employer-keep-a-workers-passport  Employers of maids must also be allowed one day per week to do whatever they like, outside the house."
13371,"If this maid isn't allowed a full day to roam the shopping malls, with her passport in hand, then her employers are criminals."
13372,It is implied racism.
13373,We have no respect for foreign workers; forgetting so quickly that they do the jobs that we can't or won't do.
13374,"And yet, we forget that it's not the foreign workers who started any of this."
13375,Asians are no better when it comes to racism or xenophobia.
13376,They 'played it so safe' that non-VTL lanes are less cumbersome than VTL lanes lol.
13377,Do you think coming from non-VTL lanes will help stop the spread?
13378,Fear is among the many reasons underlying racist behaviour and one such fear is really the west's fear that its hegemonic place in the world might eventually be usurped.
13379,"&#x200B;  You can't justify blatant racism, inhumanity and a lack of compassion to another human being just because of circumstances or socioeconomic background."
13380,"It is kind of hilarious to be honest - comments discuss how racist chinese families are, by making gross generalisations and racist remarks about chinese families."
13381,It is me or are most Chinese and Indian expats arrogant and snobs thinking that they are superior to us locals in every single way
13382,LKY himself is racist and he has his funny idea on eugenics.
13383,The fact that more Singaporean Indians have been victims of racial attacks than Indian expats also support this point.
13384,As an expat I know is hard but I definetely ubderstand that if you have no job you must leave.
13385,"For a country of 6 million population with high per capita income, expats from developed countries expected vaccination to be faster as well."
13386,But vaccination is slow as well compared to their countries (for most Western expats).
13387,You cannot deny that latent xenophobia and racism [is showing itself](https://imgur.com/gallery/UINvmVl).
13388,"We don't have to invalidate anyone's concerns, but at the same time, we don't need to let racism go viral too."
13389,"When Police asks the maid for an ID but she does not have one, she will first go for her and then for you if you have bad luck."
13390,I also know that maids even ask the employers to keep their documents.
13391,It is not racism to not like the smell of a dish.
13392,But what the original comment mentions is racism.
13393,"It is not racist, they just discriminate against people they consider undesirable people that are poor or from developing country"
13394,It is patronising to Malays that they can’t win a presidential election without an “advantage” to help them   Likewise the way GRC system is set can be considered racist as LKY figured that minorities can’t be elected and need special help to help them get representation /s
13395,It is possible for expats to be not be white.
13396,You can see in this very thread plenty of examples of casual racism that can get out of hand.
13397,"It is precisely because very little evidence is showed to justify this lack of meritocracy, besides anecdote of fake degrees, that it comes off as weird xenophobia instead of a real problem."
13398,It is probably going to be difficult to ensure that all maids have 24 hours off.
13399,"(My company pays $2000/month for expat interns, and this is without accommodation or tickets.)"
13400,But to call it racism loses the nuances.
13401,It is racism if you always reject people of a particular race regardless of whatever other good qualities they have.
13402,"If you write on your tinder profile ""no Chinese men, white men only"" I think plenty of people will see that as racism."
13403,It is racism.
13404,Chinese people are both perpetrators and victims of racism.
13405,It is racism.
13406,Textbook racism.
13407,"It is racist because the lady ""spoke perfect English"" yet couldn't string together ""can I have a Chinese nurse?"""
13408,It is racist for landlords to put people into stereotypical bins based on their skin colour alone.
13409,"Pre-filtering by 'Chinese only' or 'No Indians, sorry' on the ads is such blatant racism and should not be acceptable."
13410,It is racist if the employer makes it a rule.
13411,It is racist just to make race-based conclusions from data
13412,It is racist to make a negative assumption about another person based on their race.
13413,"If a property owner refuses to rent to a specific race because of negative assumptions based on that race, its literally racist."
13414,"In the aftermath of the Little India riots, there was a lot of public outcry over how the migrant workers were an unpredictable risk if left to go around unchecked in the city."
13415,They wouldn't make this a racist issue.
13416,"Plus, local uni requires you to have passed mother tongue."
13417,There are only three daily VTL flights for all of USA.
13418,My son will start school and there is no way I can pay expat tuition fees in international schools and getting a seat in a local school for foreigners is next to impossible.
13419,What they didn't account for is expats leaving and the population dropping due to which tax revenue fell to an extent where the government had to come up with additional tricks to recuperate their costs.
13420,Under what conditions will you stop engaging a domestic helper?
13421,Just out of perspective being an expat our company has employed and is looking to employ more locals in 2020 as we are expanding.
13422,It is simply institutionalized racism at its core but using fears of ' crazy muslims ' as the perfect excuse for this whole mess.
13423,"If you think your maid is paid a living wage in Singapore with your food and lodging, will you allow her to have a boyfriend stay in and start a family in your house?"
13424,"It is, but when most people have a racist mindset stemming from upbringing you tend to think otherwise."
13425,"But there is a cost to determined regulations and enforcement, and that cost is passed down to the consumers, be it in housing, or cleaning costs, or whatever services that migrant workers perform for us."
13426,"You don't have to look far to see this - when the migrant workers caught the Covid-19, the calls of 'deport them' and 'not our problem, why take care of them' and 'walau they get free <hotel stay, cash, SIM card, whatever> '."
13427,"But you can't jail everybody for every racist act, particularly if there is no proof."
13428,I don't think anyone has said that no expat will be hired at all.
13429,"Yes, things have become difficult for expats trying to get a job in Singapore or those in Singapore trying to change jobs but it isn't the end of the road for them."
13430,"And the end of the long chain of Con, there is some migrant worker getting paid peanuts to do enormous amounts of saikang."
13431,If you feel that I'm being racist like the other poster feel free to think whatever you want.
13432,"Name-calling and racism are two very different things, which should be kept different."
13433,"It isnt SJW, if the racism can actually cause harm, jokes are ok, but a lost child is not a joke"
13434,"It kind of worries me how casual you went on (almost glorifying) this special sort of ""xenophobia."""
13435,I guess what I'm trying to say is that the increasingly casual racism against them and the unfair generalization of these people as a single entity is ridiculously appalling.
13436,You might want to visit **the canonical page** instead: **[https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/next-generation-foreign-workers’-dormitory](https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/next-generation-foreign-workers’-dormitory)**  *****   ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/ehrq3z/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot)^( | )[^(Summon me with u/AmputatorBot)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/cchly3/you_can_now_summon_amputatorbot/)
13437,It matters when talking about xenophobic and racist.
13438,It may also be a class issue in the sense that maybe the maid didn't now how to return the cheese?
13439,"The author went to the customer service counter, but maybe the maid just went to someone working on a cash register or stacking the shelves and said to them she wants to return it and they (not being responsible for handling such matters) told her to get lost."
13440,OTOH it could be a policy (official or unofficial) that they don't accept returns from maids.
13441,It may be true but it’s also common decency if you got maid that clean and help with housework at least treat them nice if you want to treat someone like crap to fill a plastic bad with air and punch it till it pop
13442,"It may be xenophobic to complain about there being too many foreigners when they are 4–5% of the population, but not when they are 40–50%."
13443,It may not be Chinese privilege but it's definitely racism and/or xenophobia in most cases.
13444,"It may not be a good photo for any number of reasons, but how is it racist?"
13445,"I know a maid who wasted all money on dating banglas and I know another who saved every cent, so there is the whole spektra."
13446,This is angmoh expat privilege what.
13447,"It means she's stupid, racist and elitist."
13448,It's just a racist filter.
13449,Singaporeans are pretty defensive about their racism so this sub reddit isn't the best place to ask these questions.
13450,It might be a foreign worker quota.
13451,It might have been uncomfortable for the vaccinator to have to vaccinate someone so blatantly racist against them.
13452,"But yeah, I think the supervisor should have at least consulted the employee -- otherwise it gives the impression that racists can just get their way."
13453,It might not be xenophobic but it is completely idiotic.
13454,"Blaming western ideas for racism, when we know that racism has always existed in some form here, is the most surreal reach I've read to date."
13455,"Internet, Electricity, gas and water is basically the same price (if you can sleep at night without an airconditioner)  Someone already mentioned singapore expat forums, that was my first place to start' and i recommend it."
13456,"Personal experience: when I was a child, my parents would leave my brother and I at my grandparents' place while they went to work, and they also dropped the maid there to take care of us and walk us home from the kindergarten."
13457,"At some point, my grandmother started asking the maid to do housework, etc."
13458,The maid was hired to cover 1 household and the family living in it.
13459,It was immoral and illegal to ask her to work as a maid for 2 households.
13460,From then on the maid didn't go to by grandparents' place.
13461,"> And if say all 5 persons are foreign workers, living in 5 different dormitories, staying in 5 separate rooms, wouldn't everyone in those rooms have to be potentially quarantine?"
13462,So one room in a dormitory etc.
13463,It seem to have nothing to do with racism - she just hated you for whatever reasons she had
13464,"It seems from the reports that: they have a cap of 2,900 tests or so, a fixed criteria and now a focus on foreign workers."
13465,Minority foreign workers are cheap.
13466,"It seems like most people on this sub are xenophobic enough that they don't even think it's a good idea, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
13467,It seems like some uncles are overly racist perhaps due to upbringing.
13468,I noticed that my grandmother is also rather racist.
13469,Society has no place for blatant racists like this.
13470,"It seems like there has been a sharp up-take regarding complaints about immigration in Singapore, particularly against PMET immigrants who are perceived to be privileged in regards to promotion and hiring over locals."
13471,Leaving aside whether it's a factual or not( My Father who is a first-generation immigrant thinks it's correct and that local anger against immigrants is justified) It's a good launching point for a political campaign.
13472,"It seems like they are giving people who meet the VTL ""fully vaccinated"" guidelines 30 days of temporary status for purposes of Trace Together."
13473,It seems like they are trying to keep the foreign workers inside the dormitories by providing them with facilities in the dorm so they are less inclined to go out.
13474,"It's always been in your history to be a religious school as you wish, and if this school is considered a very good school but has some emphasis on the religious aspect, would you call it racist because people who aren't of that religion can't get into that elite school?"
13475,We don't have a domestic helper now as our children are all grown up but we must have had about 10 over the years.
13476,"the elder, frontline workers or caretakers) > high risk migrant workers > everyone else."
13477,"Honestly, people complaining about vaccinating our migrant workers first, so that they can actually have some semblance of normalcy, are just self-centered."
13478,Which is somewhat puzzling because I have some really close expat friends.
13479,It sucks because there’s a lot of poaching of maids from what i hear.
13480,"But first, you must prove to your employer that this co-worker is also violently racist at work."
13481,It takes a special person to see a story of a maid being an abusive person and somehow spinning it to being about maids being mistreated.
13482,"Racism, ageism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, it's all the same."
13483,It takes tremendous amount  of HR work to bring these CECA people into the company.
13484,So it is better to cover up and hopefully the next CECA is not as bad- but the shit happens again .
13485,It took a 10 year campaign before the MOM included a 1 weekly day off in all domestic helpers contracts.
13486,It took so long to clear migrant worker dorms because tests also had to be used to discharge patients.
13487,"Then he got labelled racist and that’s where the conversation ended, because the official didn’t want to discuss anything further with a racist."
13488,"Basically he is saying that Singapore's economy cannot be solely reliant on locals, and we should consider foreign talents as a permanent addition."
13489,"I am not xenophobic, and am in fact quite pro-immigration and pro-globalization."
13490,It was already 8.30pm and yet it was still the maid who had to do the feeding?
13491,"If you bother to read between the lines, you can form some logic to understand the actions the maid took."
13492,I doubt this was a special one off case where the maid had to help out and she formulated the plan to drug the baby.
13493,"It was common in ancient China but by the late Qing dynasty anti-homosexuality had become the norm, which is about the time Chinese immigrants arrived in Singapore."
13494,"It was definitely a good move to have us learn both English and our mother tongue in school, since English is the global language of business."
13495,It was initially mentioned as  'wuhan virus' - [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-what-can-you-do-health-advisory-12324632](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-what-can-you-do-health-advisory-12324632)  but it was subsequently deemed racist.
13496,Interesting how no expert says it's racist to call them UK / Africa / India variants.
13497,"That was probably the fifth racist incident I got while being in the suburbs, so I kinda get used to it and can feel the vibe when its racially driven."
13498,So which part did it even imply racism?
13499,But apparently they just want to prove to her that they are actually “not racist”.
13500,"It wasn't really a competition about who is more racist, but a question regarding racism in Singapore.. And all racism is bad, so whether or not europe or SG is more racist, it should all be long gone.."
13501,"If Singapore managed a zero case situation due to closing borders entirely for a whole,  there will be people complaining that the economy is suffering, people complaining about difficulty in getting domestic workers, construction companies complaining about not getting workers from overseas etc."
13502,This is something the government needs to balance: satisfying possibly xenophobic reactions and also ensuring that Singapore can still attract talents that might not be able to speak English well.
13503,It will be if people keep propagating the racism agenda.
13504,Slowly everything will become *racist*.
13505,It will be terrible if she anyhow attribute it to racism just because she dint get the waffles.
13506,It would be better if WLB is a thing such that maids are no longer necessary but the gov wouldn't do that.
13507,"If so, integration would barely be a problem, and we may see less xenophobia even."
13508,Same for VTL travel — host country still require under 12s to quarantine ???
13509,"They keep saying they'll do better, yet change often doesn't come (see Amy Khor's promised review of migrant worker transport in May) or gets whittled down (we somehow went from 11 promised purpose build dorms by 2021/2022 to them reneging and saying they'll only build 2 in the next 2-3 years)."
13510,"Many immigrants are humanitarian and low skilled, and don't contribute much in an economic sense."
13511,It wows me how a term (namely foreign talent) use by the government is being so taken out of context.
13512,"It'll be quite hard to make any significant changes for the foreign workers though, low wages, poor living conditions will exist as long as our country remains capitalist."
13513,"It'll take sustained levels of racism to change it, but i really do not see why Chinese culture is elevated over Indian or Malay culture such that additional funding is devoted to teaching calligraphy or Chinese opera over Batik or Indian dance."
13514,"It's 2020, with all the anti-racism protests going on around the world I believe it's a sign for the human species to tackle this long overdue problem in order to evolve as a civilization."
13515,Some might not even register or acknowledge when racism is happening right in front of their eyes due to their upbringing and privileges.
13516,"And there's a preference for young, fresh maids who are ""more innocent"" unlike trained, highly-experienced maids who ""know Singapore so well, sure got boyfriend""."
13517,"It's Bloomberg, its target readership in Asia is bank/finance execs who are mostly expats in HK/SG."
13518,"These people don't deserve the right to comment on issues such as foreign talents taking over more of our OTC or service jobs, simply because they're the main cause why Singaporeans are not willing to work in the industry."
13519,"As I [noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g5t1yk/racism_in_singapore/fo9oc4w/) in my reply:  > Reminder #27,984 of the rule that reminds us ""never engage in attempted thought when you can barely press the keys in intended sequence""."
13520,"The other POV being that if we compare to the 2012 study, perceived racism has actually increased."
13521,"""Oh, all these racists and bigots are just uneducated/low-class/old/conservative (all the common talking points), no need to mind, they will die off in a few decades""."
13522,"It lets people brush it off as a small issue and not see it as something bigger - that pretty much everyone can be racist in some way, and no amount of education, class, or money will change things on the individual level."
13523,"IT jobs have been oursourced/taken over by foreign talent, and law is still the law."
13524,.. from one appreciative and thankful expat.
13525,But giving in allows people to get away with this kind of racism.
13526,"As u/LifeTopic has no experience of Singapore, u/Cubyface used their experience in UK to illustrate that racism is present here, but not as bad as in UK."
13527,"It's a lot of money, time, effort, not to mention opportunity cost for the maid when she could have been earning money for her family back home over the last 4 years."
13528,This is xenophobic.
13529,"Although the population this affects is 99.9% Chinese nationals, it is neither racist nor xenophobic."
13530,The rest are just racists.
13531,It's a mechanism that makes 'all of Asia' roles from Singapore impossible for expatriates.
13532,Which is ironically the expats that bring the jobs to Singapore.
13533,It's a misconception that CECA is responsible for this.
13534,CECA is there specifically for intra-company transfers.
13535,Then that company can use CECA to post personnel here (note that the company must be Indian to take advantage of CECA).
13536,The vast majority of Indian nationals in Singapore are there on an employment pass.
13537,CECA has nothing to do with this.
13538,The good: The PAP government has shown that it's not completely deaf to voter sentiment and took steps to make employment of foreign workers more costly to employers.
13539,The bad: The foreign worker levy covers all kinds of work - blue collar and white collar work alike.
13540,The resentment about so-called foreign talent was mainly focused on white collar workers from the Philippines or China who are steadily replacing Singaporeans at the entry level and middle management as they expect lower wages.
13541,"Whereas most foreign talent do not get promoted beyond middle management, the problem was clearly making things tough for locals as many can't get their feet through the door to begin with."
13542,"Singaporeans wanted to curb the inflow of white collar foreign workers, but at the same time blue collar foreign workers are getting more costly and it's making the cost of business increasingly onerous."
13543,at the bottom of the new foreign worker policy that says:  *See lah!
13544,"Malaysians work permit holders and those in the ""services category"" (e.g."
13545,"The actual migrant workers receive some atas/hipster baked goods that they don't particularly appreciate, and ""festive cards"" i.e."
13546,It's a play on words that's blatantly racist.
13547,"It's a polite term for ""ang mor gau"", which translates as ""red-headed foreign devil""; Singaporean polite society demands that, if they make the tiniest change to avoid undeniably-obvious racism, that we should treat them as if they have completely eradicated racism."
13548,Most lower-income households have to share rooms and there won't be an extra room for a FDW.
13549,These are also people who have the most acute needs for a maid since few can afford having one partner not working.
13550,It's a racist term.
13551,It's a rebuttal to ops statement that only chavs are racist.
13552,It's a result of the govt regulation that employers are fined when maids get pregnant.
13553,Then no reason for maid employers to get fined.
13554,"Some people say the Chinese immigrants here are ""dregs"" but they forget that to emigrate requires a lot of drive and ambition, so immigrants are certainly not ""dregs"", even if they came over and worked as a coolie maybe they had a higher job back in China before, or some education already."
13555,It's a step in the right direction to acknowledge that this kind of racism exists instead of sweeping it under the carpet and acting like everything is just fine and dandy.
13556,"Not to mention that having a domestic helper has been ingrained in here, since it was a status symbol in our relatively recent colonial past (amongst both foreigners and local elites)."
13557,But you're the racist/discriminatory landlord.
13558,"One of my expat friends was straight up told by her manager that ""you're paid an expat salary, so you better deliver more than you are doing right now""."
13559,"It's a vicious cycle, the legality of the maid industry to a certain degree also permits our shitty work culture."
13560,"It's a weekday morning, why the maids so free?"
13561,"It's a win-win for everyone, McDonalds gets their goodwill, foreign workers get their chicken"
13562,The xinke ie first generation immigrants probably saw Singapore/Malaya as a place to soujourn.
13563,"The point of a foreign worker levy is to make hiring foreign workers more costly, not exactly to earn tax revenue."
13564,It's actually disgusting to see how some people treat their helpers/maids.
13565,It's against the law for employer to claim covid costs from their domestic helper.
13566,"You already know they are locking these people in just to appease the racist/xenophobic among us who have already mentally linked ""dark skin = disease carriers"" from the dorm cases last year."
13567,It's all fun and games until the expats pack up their offices and thus the jobs for locals too.
13568,"So to learn that some Chinese people don't touch beef, you need to put beef on their plates and get called racist?"
13569,It's also comical considering how you have more Western PRs and expats from different countries living here now and mingling with our local culture and blending in.
13570,Sg doesn't have that kind of xenophobic crimes you see in other places.
13571,"It's also the possibility of borders closing, as seen with the migrant workers situation with India."
13572,"It's always ironic to see a Singaporean, most likely a descendants of immigrants, telling another immigrant to ""go back to your country""."
13573,* https://www.expat.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=600587 * https://www.expat.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=770085 * https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewtopic.php?t=102243  P.s.
13574,I've never known Singaporeans to be this *outspokenl*y racist.
13575,"It's because MOM will fine the employer if the maid runs away (used to be the case, might have changed)."
13576,"It's because expats have kids, family and pretty much everything else locals do."
13577,It's been ages since Singapore has really 'relied' on foreign talent.
13578,It's because the government treat employers like parents and fine the employer 5k if their maid got pregnant.
13579,So basically giving the employer the parental role of ensuring their maid don't have sex that makes them act like parents.
13580,"It's been 2 years and I've been hearing about expats running away for at least a year and a half, wondering when the great repatriation will have an actual impact on us."
13581,The best is the #nomaidsundays when their maids have the day off and some are proud that they've accomplished a cold storage trip by themselves.
13582,It's both lar but racism and the need to protect white prestige driving the colonial authorities to do something about this
13583,"It's both sexist and racist, what's so hard to understand lmao, Singapore is fundamentally a conservative country."
13584,It's casual racism.
13585,"If the racist person then says something like ""don't be so sensitive, it's good to have small eyes because you don't need sunglasses as much"", would that placate you?"
13586,Do I need to apply for an employment pass or a visa before I leave ?
13587,"It probably started out in good faith, then got bastardised to be racist."
13588,"If the family featured happened to be of Chinese ethnicity, would the netizens have reacted in such a xenophobic and racist way?"
13589,But must also make sure their children are not taught to be racists too.
13590,"If we could prove a consistent pattern between employer-FDW sexual relations and false rape allegations, the law is absolutely warranted."
13591,I feel that a big part of your issue with the recent case is about the false rape charge possibly triggered by the power dynamics between an employer and an FDW.
13592,"I would contend that your proposal should apply to any employer-employee interaction, and not just FDW."
13593,It's easy to say that but subconscious and systemic racism still exist and still affect minorities disproportionately.
13594,"And if you're advocating us just to care less about racists and racism, I encourage you to read the MLK quote below where he talks about his frustration with the white moderate:  ""I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
13595,"We complain about our SME bosses and get stressed out by the WFH eroding work-life boundaries.... That is the life that many FDWs have to put up with, for years."
13596,The aspirations that we have are not that much different from what FDWs have.
13597,"People blacking out their Facebook pictures, next month they'll be back to saying their racists comments."
13598,"MOM currently practices some sort of face to face check in with domestic workers, but it seems to be selective."
13599,"[https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/employers-guide/fdw-interview](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/employers-guide/fdw-interview)  >During the interview, your FDW will be asked employment related questions, such as:   >   >How well is she adapting to her work environment?"
13600,"One MOM FAQ mentioned that there were 240,000 FDWs employed in SG in 2017."
13601,"Now if you're more likely to place that trust in certain ethnicities/nationalities than others, based on your 'personal views' that are not established by any studies or published facts, that's racism/xenophobia."
13602,"Not even showing the house to people based solely on their ethnicity or nationality is just racism/xenophobia, there's absolutely no 2 ways about it."
13603,Singaporeans will complain if they feel that too many South Asian or PRC foreign workers are living next to them.
13604,Triggers the xenophobia more.
13605,To equate everyone from a certain culture or country of subscribing to the same values is racist and xenophobic.
13606,It's for foodpanda.. and there's no reason for domestic workers to have to use different lifts either
13607,It's for those expats who don't mind spending $9 on organic broccoli.
13608,"It's funny because most Singaporeans are descendents of similar ""foreign workers""."
13609,It's funny how a country built on the backs of immigrants are complaining about foreigners.
13610,Can anyone explain to me how this doesn't reflect casual racism?
13611,How many friends are really aware if their friends are offended by racist jokes or mild racial insensitivity?
13612,It's pretty much your right to tell a racist joke vs people taking offense.
13613,Contrast this to the way our government (ab)uses _mother tongue_.
13614,"I would wager that the latter group is probably becoming the majority, and so it's not technically right to call Mandarin our ""mother tongue"" anymore, at least if you want to abide by the technical meaning of the term."
13615,"As another commenter has noted, it's one thing to be not racist, but one can go further and become _anti_ racist."
13616,"On Instagram I follow [minorityvoices](https://instagram.com/minorityvoices?utm_medium=copy_link) which highlight what I've written above, and is a great starting point for finding out more on how you can contribute to anti-racism in Singapore."
13617,It's hard to change a racist's mindset and make them understand la.
13618,What I mean is the closet racists should keep their comments to themselves and not display it publicly since its the Internet age.
13619,"For all we know, the racist could be a loving father or filial son."
13620,"FDW visa auction would be very, very bad."
13621,Dual income families largely rely on FDWs to look after children and the elderly.
13622,"There aren't local equivalents of FDWs that need to be protected, and FDWs are blocked from becoming permanent residents, so why have a quota?"
13623,"Imo, calling it racism would imply some sort of intent."
13624,"It's important to treat domestic helpers kindly but if you keep increasing their salaries, a lot of middle-class Singaporeans won't be able to afford to pay them, and then how will mothers continue contributing to the workforce?"
13625,The maid was employed to mainly take care of the infant.
13626,It's indeed abuse to not provide (sufficient) food for one's domestic worker.
13627,"Previously for the maids looking after my grandmother at the hospital, my uncles and aunties will always provide them with money for food or Kopitiam card to use."
13628,My auntie's new maid was hungry and asked if she could eat the curry puff.
13629,"Previously she asked the maid to eat, but the maid assumed she had to eat all 3 curry puffs, so took a long time to finish up and return."
13630,> without worsening the situation for the maid as well?
13631,You might want to check with the NGO which are helping domestic workers.
13632,Some posters are de-humanising maids without realising it.
13633,Day-care and maids aren't good fixes for the well-being of children.
13634,"It's interesting that there are a number of married couple maid abusers, it's like they share a penchant for sadism."
13635,It's ironic that it was COVID policies that gave a push for foreigners to leave https://www.npr.org/2022/02/20/1081557870/hong-kong-expat-exodus-covid-restrictions
13636,Gonna get down voted but what I said is what minorities in sg get when speaking about racism.
13637,"It's not illegal to think about stealing, or fantasise about murdering someone, or have racist thoughts."
13638,"And talking about the criminal penalties of racist acts *does* reduce racist behaviour, via deterrence."
13639,Those should removed and if needed codified in the law better so the maid can reap additional benefits.
13640,It sounds to me like they probably are over stretching their own finances to have a maid if they cannot afford heaters on their showers.
13641,"It's like he's never heard of Hardwarezone - among countless other things like racist rental ads, random harassment and the garden variety casual racism people experience daily."
13642,It's literally not racism.
13643,"Just because racism might have played a role in the referendum, does not mean it's a main factor in the GE."
13644,"It's mainly her fear i guess, she says the old patient will scold her whenever she sees the maid eating."
13645,"But i was more shocked and sad that the maid declined food even when the old patient was not around (though after i explained, she accepted it)."
13646,Let us define new citizens as citizens who were naturalized in the last ten years in the open door immigration policy that began in the early 2000's.
13647,"The law is basically forcing you to keep it quiet, the same way you cannot just write a fb post about how Malays are evil in Singapore, which is illegal, but you are free to continue to be racist towards Malays in your mind, but need to keep it to yourself."
13648,It's more of a 'get out don't take our jobs' kind of thing rather than racism.
13649,So we can't really ask other countries to lift the travel restrictions.
13650,It's more than just foreign talent.
13651,"However local companies argue about achieving the diversity quota during the hiring process, the CECA pact alone would still explain the lopsided distribution of Indian nationals within the IT sector."
13652,It's no secret that we do have a lot of people here who regard our foreign workers as subhumans.
13653,It's no surprise that a post talking about racism/xenophobia with a thumbnail of a kid that isn't specifically Chinese-Singaporean then goes on to attract racism/xenophobia in the comments... 🙄  The bigoted ignorance is saddening
13654,It's no surprise these are the same people that scold and beat their maids like dogs when they make mistakes
13655,It's nonsense usually repeated by minority-race racists to excuse their actions.
13656,"It's not ""racism""."
13657,But it's not racism.
13658,Let's not lump these kinds of thing towards the true racism that's happening in Singapore.
13659,After school care + a home nurse that comes by once every few days would cost more than getting a domestic helper.
13660,"Despite the name, people dont see domestic helpers as helpers."
13661,"I think we aren't ready as a society to have domestic helpers, but our economy kinda pushes people in that direction."
13662,Everyone is re-imposing testing and/ or travel restrictions.
13663,It's quite evident that you've not been on the receiving end of any racism or bullying before - you only feel hurt when you choose to feel this way?
13664,"If you are white you are expat, if brown, yellow or black you are migrant worker."
13665,Singapore has not done right by the expats.
13666,"I agree, but mainly for the Bangladeshi expats."
13667,If we don't want to be exposed to covid then no one in society - foreign worker or soldiers - should be living in conditions that could trigger an infection cluster.
13668,"You get expats which earns a ton of money and lives very comfy lives, and you get the poor construction workers who works for a dime."
13669,"If the expats complained about not having comfy homes, you can be sure the administration will be bending over."
13670,"**AMDK** = Aiya only a few mass shootings per year, not every AMDK is racist, let me go back to watching hollywood and netflix TV series please \*yawn\*  **Sinkie** = omg worst racist country in the world, I expected to be treated by VIP but got ignored like an average invisible person here!"
13671,So you can take it that any *outright* show of racism is literally illegal.
13672,"It's called having a grip of reality and that even though it's extremely politically incorrect to put a label on foreign workers, it is 100% justifiable to."
13673,"The general sort of men that maids would date, can belong to very different socioeconomic backgrounds."
13674,"Maybe if you trust migrant workers so much, go rent an apartment in the hostels that are heavily populated by PRC/Bangladeshi workers, and leave your door open , as though you are staying in a HDB apartment in Marine parade, with a nice Macbook left on your desk with expensive watches lying around."
13675,Abusing the maid vs allowing a maid to have relationships are totally different things.
13676,Now there will be maids without job.
13677,It's not even xenophobia.
13678,No Singaporean is ever going to want to be an expat there.
13679,"It's not hatred of Asians, but falsely assuming positive qualities based on race is still racism."
13680,But it's not the fault of any organisation that many Singaporeans are fucking racist.
13681,I've seen a family eat in a restaurant while their maid sat outside on the floor.
13682,Similarly it's not illegal to give preferential treatment to those whom you like as long it's not related to racism and discrimination.
13683,It's not just FDWs treated this way.
13684,PM Lee only managed to achieve the levels of economic growth seen in Singapore since 2004 because he brought in a lot of foreign workers to avoid Japan's demographic-induced stagnation (which Abe just managed to turn the last decade).
13685,It's not just western expats.
13686,Hopefully life goes back to normal soon and expats will be flocking back.
13687,I suspect foreign workers are more productive because they are fit 25 year old dudes.
13688,It is racist.
13689,Stop making excuses about how yeah its racist but racism is easier for you.
13690,"It's not necessarily racist by itself, but it's certainly a behavioural predisposition that lends itself to both overt racism, and the tendency to condone racism."
13691,"It's not on Reddit, but try Facebook groups, and especially https://forum.singaporeexpats.com and the large amount of expat history available on Google."
13692,"The Asian racism is even worse on our own race and countrymen with perceived minor differences  like skin fairness, it's just appalling."
13693,It's not racism as the person shouting appears to be an Indian.
13694,It's not racism if the client is not ready for a non Chinese tenant is it?
13695,It's not racism.
13696,It's not racism.
13697,"It's not racist, majority of the countries in the world require people to either learn their national language or be proficient in English to be able to even get PR status."
13698,It's not so much about race and racism as it is about religion and the judiciary.
13699,"A racist who is systemically disenfranchising minority races is bad, and so a racist who uses a racial term casually is just as bad, because both are racists."
13700,"If they disagree, then they are just as racist/misogynist/fascist as you are."
13701,My mom's friend married his best mate's maid and is currently living in Singapore.
13702,It's not the first time that idiots treat maids like shit and it's not going to be the last.
13703,"Did you know that before 2012, each work permit holder from Bangladesh/India/Myanmar etc (basically the non-Malaysian, non-PRC pool) could only work for a maximum of 6 years?"
13704,How is this less racist than other discriminatory statements?
13705,It's not xenophobic to mistrust Chinese health data.
13706,We don't hate expats.
13707,"It's ok to not know, but not knowing and just acting out on your own preconceived belief ala the 2 housing agents will just brand you as racist."
13708,"As a fellow former sydneysider who has been living here for some years now, the best thing I did was get involved in sports - ideally where there are more locals than expats!"
13709,The expat bubble is too easy (and expensive).
13710,You'll still need to do a PCR 48 hours before boarding the VTL flight back (SG requirement).
13711,"It's paid by the migrant workers themselves, not taxpayer or employers."
13712,From the article:  > Providers are also to deliver healthcare in a manner that keeps migrant workers' out-of-pocket expenses low.
13713,Now the father is complicit in his antics in this case with the maid.
13714,You can't blame minorities for not applying to a school that doesn't teach their mother tongue.
13715,I'm a 2gen PRC immigrant who speaks Chinese at home with PRC parents.
13716,"I comment in Chinese in a Chinese language subreddit so you can look at my comment history if you still want to shit on my ""watered-down mother tongue""."
13717,If forced to guess I would probably say less than 10% of non-immigrant Hwachong grads are at that level.
13718,"The benefits of having a whole school that only teaches only Chinese as a second language is evidently marginal, while the existence of SAP remains as a constant reminder to minority Singaporeans that there are elite institutions that they can never hope to enter purely because they have the wrong mother tongue."
13719,"The worse part is, the racists don't even know that they are being racists."
13720,It's pretty easy to fall into the trap of believing your countrymen aren't racists when you aren't a racial minority.
13721,"I fundamentally believe that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of a free country, but that is entirely irrelevant to how racist a society is."
13722,Your little essay pissed me off because it is ignorant of the reality of racism in Singapore and the social progress it has yet to achieve.
13723,"I do think that even that is not _that_ likely, though, since most of the people who care enough to protest would be expats who aren't allowed to join protests at Hong Lim."
13724,"And then at the end, I don't mean you, only the racist ones."
13725,"It's quite evident, both online and in private conversations and overhearing racist comments from locals here."
13726,It's racism against Chinese people.
13727,https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o7kd7l/woke_rsgs_lack_of_interest_against_racism_towards/
13728,It's racist because it should not matter.
13729,It's racist in this context.
13730,It's racist to assume that any particular race will cause more wear and tear that's my fucking point.
13731,You are only thinking about yourself and justifying your racism with profit
13732,"It's racist to comment on it in such a way as to imply that ""all normal people"" can't stand the smell."
13733,"It's racist for you as a landlord to refuse to rent to Indians/Bangladeshis because you worry that they might cook curry and you don't like that, *even if you're not there at the time."
13734,"If you look at your comment history and can't find anything racist or xenophobic, then no amount of pointing out will have any effect."
13735,">	LKY is either racist or not  I would argue that applying the context of Mahathir echoing his criticism, he was not being racist."
13736,Are we expecting Singaporeans or foreign workers to become more impervious to the virus in time?
13737,"It's ridiculous, cos we pay these FDWs peanuts compared to what a elderly care trained nurse should be paid."
13738,It's sad how locals seem to hate expats and vice versa.
13739,It's sad that I have heard my own mother say some ignorant racist stuff about Indians.
13740,I know it's not much but I hope in my own family we'll teach each other not to be racist.
13741,It's simplistic to view the situation as racist.
13742,"The point is, each landlord has their unique and justifiable considerations and the true is that it may have nothing to do with being racist at all."
13743,"The government tries so much to change this with all their maid orientation classes and everything, and all the fines and jailtime for those who abuse maids, hell even the TV ads basically telling us that maids are not robots,  but it's the insane superiority complex *some* Singaporeans have against foreigners that result in this."
13744,It's slavery yo  Stop using maids   Let the downvotes begin
13745,"It's so absurd that the landlord gets to keep the $500 deposit, disgusting person for abusing a loophole like that against migrant workers to boot."
13746,We don't need racist ideologues to be the banner we stand behind at all.
13747,"I believe this is being utilised to the max for now with the active testing of dormitory-clusters, as well as recovering patients to discharge them."
13748,What's even more remarkable that the same racist rhetoric is still being applied 55 years later.
13749,"It's stereotyping, not racist since it's kind of a positive message (Indians are immune to CoV, lol)."
13750,"I'm not taking a direct stand on the current CECA discussions and attitudes towards foreigners (more accurately, ""foreign talent"")."
13751,"If we think that anyone who disagrees with anti-CECA automatically is a PAP supporter and cannot see how out of touch their rhetoric can be, it's needless polarising."
13752,"If it boils down to ""in group"" and ""out group"", us versus them mentality that drives this xenophobia, I don't wish to identify myself within a group of asshats."
13753,"Are you racist for saying Spanish Flu, Marburg Virus, etc..."
13754,This is why /u/malaysianlah or any other racists should exercise caution when commenting online.
13755,"I've had interactions with racists, here and elsewhere, who have made it crystal clear that the *only* thing stopping them putting their attitudes into physical force is fear of the authorities."
13756,It's the company culture that causes this issue rather than expat vs local problem.
13757,When has foreign talent ever helped Singapore?
13758,"It's the idea that to understand racism and how to solve it, you need to look at the cultural, social and legislative systems that enforce racism or racial superiority"
13759,The government can sign 50 CECAs I don't really care.
13760,"For Indian expats, Malay and Indian professionals have more nuanced views on how they fit in here."
13761,But they also shouldn't be surprised when they're called racist.
13762,"If the landlord doesn't care about being labelled racist, more power to them."
13763,"So it was the same typical deal in those racist days that we'd poke fun at his skin for a bit (I don't really remember, but I am very certain some slurs were dropped even as a joke), but for the most part people treated him as a Chinese because ""he's one of us"" or whatever."
13764,"They don't get to vote (migrant workers in Singapore), or their votes are meaningless (Hong Kongers)."
13765,"I'm confused as to why in this day and age, young people who have access to the internet, are still so goddamn racist."
13766,"Having travelled and worked abroad for a couple of years (less details in case I get doxxed), Singapore is one of the least racist countries you can be in."
13767,"One known fact is on sundays, our foreign workers go hang out at the Geylang/Paya Lebar vicinity and many have partners who work as domestic helpers in our homes, who also go to that area on sundays."
13768,"Could you imagine if it wasn't imposed and this went out of control, spreading not only to our domestic helpers, but further spreading to any elderly that they may be taking care of?"
13769,I think forcing people to date other races they find unattractive by calling them racist for not dating them is kinda ridiculous.
13770,Surveying the helpers and migrant workers will likely yield predictable results.
13771,The CECA description is here:  http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta_ceca.asp?hl=6  And the list of 127 occupations can be found here:  http://www.fta.gov.sg/ceca/annex%209a%20-%20list%20of%20professionals.pdf  You can make up your mind on whether there are Singaporeans who can do the jobs listed.
13772,"When my wife and I had a child, the number one question we got was, ""When are you going to get a maid?"""
13773,"And those ones that tend to only mingle with Asian people..., are the ones that usually come back home with stories of racism."
13774,"As much as I can, I let others know when they've made a racist comment, but I feel ashamed to say that sometimes I agree with the sentiment."
13775,I disagree with FDWs aiding gender equality though.
13776,> Can you imagine a Singapore without FDWs?
13777,It's unlikely that you'll face racism because you're Indian.
13778,"Nonetheless, there's a significant chance you'll face xenophobia because you're foreign."
13779,It's very difficult to move to Singapore as an expat - your employer needs to prove that your skillset is unique enough that a local hire can't do this job.
13780,"This means that expats who arrive in Singapore are top contributors to their companies, i.e."
13781,"The intent for zero racism, world peace and what not is glorious sounding, but it cannot really come true unless it’s an intent held by the majority, which unfortunately will never be the case."
13782,"You can’t have zero racism, zero terrorism, zero abuse etc just because you think it's ""the right way to be""."
13783,"To take the example of racism here, if you get hung up on your ideals too much, you are going to eventually meet people who will question you on things like ""why is racism wrong?"
13784,""", ""the minority also racist towards the majority, what about that?"
13785,"However, just because you can't will over the masses doesn't mean you can't will over yourself, Don't be a racist/abuser yourself, be the change you want to see in this world, stand true to your ideals irrespective of situation, help out the victim of racism etc etc, feel free to call out racism but to expect a ""utopia"" where everyone is nice and accepting of each other is simply not realistic, not in the past, not now and certainly not in the future as well."
13786,It's what I have been told when calling out racism.
13787,Then they proceed to think nothing is wrong here thus there's no racism.
13788,"Ergo it is now a ""racist"" incident even though it does not fit the dictionary definition of discrimination by race."
13789,Its a widespread practice so I would term it as systemic racism.
13790,But its when it is used with subtle (and often not so subtle) implications where it gets bigoted and xenophobic.
13791,Chinese and Malay families don’t normally hire Indian domestic workers.
13792,"Many Japanese and Indian expats do this all the time, for example."
13793,"lol   Whataboutism would be ""hey, look they are racist too!!"""
13794,Its crazy how internalized racism against minorities are that they think its okay to generalise and stereotype minorities in a negative light.
13795,"Everytime a racist trends online, all these ignorant people comes in droves and comment some of the most ignorant and uneducated shit without realising they're part of the problem."
13796,"For now its just racist comments, what if they turn violent?"
13797,What if you are watch a racist physically assaulting someone.
13798,Its easier to bond the expat with the company (if you leave in 2 years you owe 5k).
13799,They also have a lot of migrant workers living in dorms.
13800,Its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators (DO) though.
13801,"Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others."
13802,"Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price?"
13803,"Its like they took every homophobe, racist, conspiracy nut and imbecile in SG and threw them in one news site."
13804,Its not an acceptable mistake to forget about a huge subset of our foreign expats.
13805,The amount of mental gymnastics a Chinese person would go through to claim there is no racism in Singapore is beyond me
13806,Its not even just expats.
13807,Its not just about being racist tbh.
13808,"Its also about it being reductionist imo  Like... You want CMIO representation so badly you characterise representation as caricatures of the different races, reducing them to just those points?"
13809,Im not mad at it nor do I think that they were trying to be overtly racist.
13810,Its not just that； the VTLs are pretty much a floodgate to begin with.
13811,"Its not racism, its unintended racism?"
13812,"The worse people are those who literally address their helpers as ""maid""."
13813,"They forget that their ""maids"" are also living human beings with names."
13814,Its not technically news if migrant workers think the food is bad.
13815,"There are plenty of Singaporeans who are Indians, the racism that you may have heard of is mostly aimed towards the low-level Bangladeshi workers who tend to have poor hygiene (due to their jobs, mostly in construction or public cleaning) and their lack of English (uneducated for the most part)."
13816,"Its not the pinnacle of journalism and its just your typical ""Western expat"" POV."
13817,Its one of several reasons most nations in the developed world require some level oof foreign talent but more acute for Singapore because of size.
13818,You cannot have perfect planning to fill your local needs using traditional workforce development - the world changes too fast for that and foreign talent is always going to be the most effective option to support dynamic scaling as a result.
13819,"Adding the stress due to lockdown and possibly Anthony missing his ""clubbing"" just might have amplified his subtle racism which was in head to being physical and violent."
13820,Some of my friends/relatives treat their maids like crap because they think they are entitled to it because they pay their salary.
13821,All you have to do is recognize that they had this racist view for the past... maybe 20 to 60 years and prove to them that they have been wrong for that amount of time.
13822,"Its the Landlords that are racists, can the Gov do anything against them?"
13823,The racism is directed towards people of dark/brown skin (Indians/Pakistani/possibly Arabs) and not non chinese.
13824,Dont hear the same backlash against them  Funny that you say all indian nationals + 1 expat.
13825,The indian nationals cant be expats?
13826,"Its true, there is still racism in Singapore."
13827,"""No migrant worker demanded an apology""."
13828,"Its usually don't rent to Indian citizens, Singaporean Indians is ok   Ps some people don't rent to PRC'S too  Personally I don't really bother with racist remarks, even when some redditors message me with such remarks...."
13829,Just that it's not the aggressive in-your-face kind of racism here.
13830,Itsrainingraincoats helps migrant workers and isn’t linked to any church.
13831,They bring migrant workers to the Flyer using the donated vouchers
13832,It’ll be good if the police can make her undergo a psychiatric test to see if she’s really mentally unsound If she’s not should charge her for racism related offences.
13833,"In that case, we are also saying it’s okay to be racist, as long as it brings about convenience to our lives."
13834,It’s a chav thing but they might also be racist chavs.
13835,Assigning a trait (negative or otherwise) to all people of a particular race is racist.
13836,"Like I said to someone else in this thread, racist is racist."
13837,What you are arguing now is whether or not it is morally ok to be racist.
13838,It’s a fallacy that VTL flights are safer than non-VTL.
13839,"As at 30 Dec 2021, 75% of the imported cases arrived on VTL (check MOH to validate if you wish)."
13840,Also short term visitors are not allowed to enter SG on non VTL.
13841,Most of the passengers taking non VTL are SG citizens/ PRs as pass holders need to get their HR to apply for their re entry.
13842,So the probability of an unvaxxed passenger on a non VTL is close to zero.
13843,The racism is mainly between the asians.
13844,"It’s a home for a portion of immigrants, probably a minority."
13845,A tick in the right box is not xenophobic or racist hence neither should the populous.
13846,"As I said in a earlier post, don’t confuse xenophobia with nosophobia."
13847,Blatant racism and violence should be frowned upon in this day in age.
13848,"Our northern neighbours take a total opposite approach and do everything for the rakyat and bumiputra, that other races label the government as racist."
13849,It’s a problem if you assume expat = rich.
13850,"Take the same expat and drop them back into their homeland and they’ll land somewhere in the upper middle class (generalizing of course and a 1pc exists everywhere)   These guys aren’t rich, they just have some money."
13851,Don’t the FDWs need annual medical?
13852,The maid can spend as much time as she desires with her boyfriend during the time-off from work.
13853,It’s about time Singapore started talking about our deep-rooted racism issues a bit more openly.
13854,Hate these kind of dumb racist posts.
13855,"Am I allowed to call it my country, all of the racist pieces of shit?"
13856,It’s all fun and games until you realize that every Chinese Singaporean is an immigrant too
13857,"It’s also why we rely on expat housing placement agencies to rent apartments abroad for work, not every local wants to rent to a foreigner."
13858,"Whenever discussing migrant worker, then we contrast it with Dubai."
13859,"I don’t think this will change anytime soon, we’re too reliant on expatriates for our economy, but the closest we can get is trying to build alternative visions of “Singaporean-ness”."
13860,"They will only accept it’s racism if an agent actually comes out and says “no Indians allowed”, when obviously an agent with common sense would not want to state that explicitly in writing in 2021."
13861,"(Actually, they probably wouldn’t accept it’s racism even then, but would instead fall back on the “people can do what they want with their property” and “actually there’s a reason for the stereotype” cards.)"
13862,"It’s as if the prima deli staff woke up thinking: “Chinese are getting their waffles snatched by others”  I agree, like most instances, nothing racist other than the races of people involved."
13863,It’s astonishing how this word is thrown around by low-income immigrants.
13864,I’ve heard foreign exchange students refer to themselves as expats ... it’s mind boggling.
13865,#expatlife
13866,"It’s definitely an attitude change, not just about SG, but all expat assignments."
13867,So this is one structural thing that keeps expats paid higher than locals - we can’t put our kids in the schools and therefore need to negotiate even our local packages accordingly.
13868,I do find the expat bellyaching to be .. let’s just say a bit much.
13869,"Yes it sucks and the game changed, but as an expat we’re not owed anything by our host country."
13870,As an expat we get a lot of perks but the downside is lack of control / privilege of citizenship.
13871,Plus racist comments - enough said
13872,"Plenty of bosses treat their migrant workers like that also, like children."
13873,"Nobody is going to compensate for the damages for harbouring illegal immigrants, illegal subletting and over-population of the unit, or renovation expenses for the damages to the unit."
13874,It’s easier to condemn racist acts when you know there’s no fear of backlash.
13875,"It’s starting to induce a lot of anxiety and panic attacks in me when you’re too poor to go for a VTL trip (and the flights are all fully booked too), can’t meet friends often (2 pax rule) and can’t out without scanning the almost entirely redundant trace together now."
13876,Stop making your maids do work in unsafe situations.
13877,Expect initial VTL to be NSW and Victoria only.
13878,It’s interesting to see people talking about acceptance and then immediately say racist slurs.
13879,"Whatever your agenda is, the last point you say will be racist shit."
13880,It’s interesting to see the story being angled in a way that it focuses on how the employers are at a loss since their maid did not want to work with them.
13881,I came off reading the headline thinking it was a maid who couldn’t cope with working as a maid and so wanted to leave.
13882,Turns out the maid was made to work long hours.
13883,It’s like saying “A (race) man saved a kitten.”   Is there a need to mention foreign worker?
13884,It does not only apply to FDWs but all WP holders.
13885,Singapore exploits both maids and construction workers— don’t have to sugar coat it to make anyone feel better.
13886,"It’s not a problem of vaccine availability for our migrant workers, but rather them refusing it."
13887,It’s not about FB and racist hiding behind the screen.
13888,Control FB is not eliminating racism.
13889,You are confirming to me that some of the people here crying foul about racism are just as ignorant about culture and history as the folks at PA who put up the standee in the first place.
13890,It’s whether the reporting is helping that expat family’s case or not.
13891,"As of now, the infection rate of the migrant worker dorms and general population are exactly the same at zero."
13892,"It has everything to do with money, Indonesia is one of our trading partners which means opening VTL with these countries will enable more economic activities between both countries."
13893,"Vaccination rates is part of the consideration, secondary to economic activities  Rmb US pressured us into opening VTL with them?"
13894,"It’s not as simple as that, but it does sound like the maid had her own set of frustrations and ended up taking it out on the poor dog."
13895,Racial assumption is the biggest source of racism.
13896,The space is preplanned by property developer and yes smaller 😅 I agree w the bucket though and just wonder if it’s a temp solution offered by the family ( one pail and no heater in maid bathroom)   Ii.
13897,This was something demanded by Singaporeans after months of insisting the gold standard and they are world class despite numerous complaints from employers and NGOs on their failures at the migrant worker dorms.
13898,You just cannot be racist with regards to business practices.
13899,It’s not just “expats vs everyone else”.
13900,"The term “immigrant” is used these days to denote every foreign worker, regardless of one’s plans (long-term vs short-term)."
13901,I can be posted to the UK for a year or two and I’d still be labelled as an immigrant and not a migrant despite not having plans to settle down for the long haul.
13902,It’s not like housing and food are provided like some glamorous expat package where they have an expense account for Waku Ghin and a bungalow in sentosa cove.
13903,"It’s not only maids , all the workers who stay in dormitories too and   NSFs"
13904,"It’s not racist, but nowadays any issue to do with race + triggered feelings = racism"
13905,"It’s not so much about maids having sex, but the associated risks that comes with them having sex."
13906,There are cases where maids brought their partners to the employers’ home to have sex while their employers are out (free and convenient).
13907,"Our law forbade maids or Low income foreign workers to get pregnant and give birth locally, so they will have to be deported."
13908,"Racist people have always been racist, they just hid it well until the virus emboldened them to come out of the woodworks and speak their minds."
13909,"It’s not uncommon but it’s not right in my opinion, just as it’s not right for able people to employ maids."
13910,The Leo dormitory at kaki Bukit .
13911,I’ll just wait until they use the VTL approach for all travel and it will be easier.
13912,"But anyways, I was just curious since there a many Muslim immigrants in Singapore of Southeast Asian background."
13913,A person who claims that “all the foreign workers would have sex with the maids” is definitely racist to me.
13914,Foreign workers and maids are not allowed to have sex?
13915,"It’s probably easier to deport foreign workers who tend to be working in low-income jobs and have no stakes in the country, compared to trying to do the same with richer expats who likely have property and may even have settled down in the country with Singaporean spouses."
13916,"Revoking his work pass is as easy as escorting him to his dormitory, getting him to pack what little possessions he has, then shipping him back home."
13917,And there is a long line of foreign workers queuing up to take his place.
13918,1/ Context 1: Many racist spectacles recently.
13919,It is better that these things go viral to force people to discuss about it more and for people who are racists to realise how ridiculous their thinking is.
13920,"I think both have an element of ethnic comparison that, if not dealt with well, can result in racism."
13921,"It is not the roles of migrant workers in dorm to do rubbish disposal, etc because clearly they are the occupants and not paid to do that job."
13922,Notably in WW2 the Americans were called out when they brought their racist practices to British pubs
13923,"It’s sad when people cannot distinguish the truly shitty expats who silo themselves among their own and really treat Singapore and it’s people as expendable and a stepping stone to other things, versus more well-meaning expats who make the effort to make a life here and integrate themselves into society here."
13924,"This ”expats taking our jobs and treating us like shit” situation here is definitely infuriating and doesn’t come from nowhere, but can we be more discerning about the people we lash out against?"
13925,Seems strange you only have empathy for the person in power and being racist
13926,Just look at the Filipino/Indonesian maids working in sg.
13927,And those little maid rooms we build in our condo looks like little jailhouse.
13928,Does ranting about the disintegrating relationship between you and your maid on social media help mend it in any way?
13929,It’s so upsetting to see fellow Singaporeans acting nastily to the foreign workers in Singapore.
13930,"Sure, we don’t express our racism by means of force or violence but the way we treat foreign workers are inexcusable."
13931,"When Covid started, there were implicit acts of racism towards Mainland Chinese."
13932,"With the dormitory situation now, we have Singaporeans talking down to these workers."
13933,It’s still racist policy even if the company has a commercial reason for not hiring particular races or for paying them less.
13934,It’s surprising but when I mentioned to people that a loanshark ask me to pay my maid’s debt and I refused to.
13935,It’s the same with maids too.
13936,It’s very annoying i tried To post this but required to censor the racists’ names
13937,It’s very difficult to make sense of such results because of the big grey area of casual racism.
13938,"People living in a less racist society could report more frequent encounters of racist events because they are more aware and count all those daily micro aggressions like people talking in Chinese at work in the presence of non-Chinese colleagues, irregular nasi padang pricing, assuming certain people are maids etc."
13939,A second post was about the Clarke Quay bunch of expats that were caught on camera but for a period of time there was no news that they had been charged.
13940,"As far as I know, no reference has actually come out to say she is a racist in real life."
13941,Esp for the elderly like their grandmother who’s coming on the trip too because they’re the ones in the news particularly getting attacked by young racists.
13942,"I’d fuckin’ love to hear a “mental illness” victim card being used here, cmon any bigoted asswipes wanna come up with other excuses to justify the actions of said racist?"
13943,I’d like to see Australia gives citizenship to fruit pickers and india opens up to foreign investors and not being so racist and defensive.
13944,"However, I do have my own line of what is considered racism or not, and the existence of a believe in the superiority of one race over another is what I usually look out for to term something racist."
13945,"Theres a distinction I’ll make even between jokes about skin color: “Room too dark only can see your teeth!” vs “You never bath ah, skin so dirty.” Second joke will be the one that is racist in my opinion."
13946,"There is a racist element in the united states, in fact many factions, though overall still making up a minority of the population."
13947,- racists against black people - racist against asians - racist against brown people - and a growing popularity of racism against white people  Not sure where the radicalization is coming from.
13948,Its racist to want equal treatment?
13949,I hope that your mind will be opened by foreign workers you deem “good enough” and that you’ll learn to not judge by race or where people come from.
13950,If the cousin is like that then I also “prefer” not to recommend tutors to racist people lor
13951,The only racist incident we encountered was during a bus ride.
13952,"I’m First Nations from Canada and face a lot Of racism from Indian immigrants, Is it normal for Indians to be racist but also victims?"
13953,I’m a 37m expat looking for folks to jam with.
13954,"I’m a bit radical in this, but I think we need much tougher punishments for people who think that it’s fine to act out their racism in public, they need to be taught otherwise."
13955,In US foreign workers still pay for social securities and Medicare which they don’t benefit from.
13956,"I work for an MNC with people from all over the world, no racism issues so far, at least that I know."
13957,"But when I see the government making these comments, people being hateful, not supportive and totally making generalisations of ‘expats’ whilst expecting the government to fix their problems.. it’s very frustrating and disheartening.."
13958,"If you think “casual racism” is bad, this is mandated government orders that had been going on for 50years and only recently starts to get better."
13959,"I read through threads here about how racism in Singapore is overstated, that everyone is dating everyone, and it’s true that my experience is limited to one week."
13960,It is racist plain and simple.
13961,"Problem is, as an expat, I sometimes don’t know what’s a local favorite and what’s a different Asian country’s favorite that’s been imported."
13962,So locals and long term expats: what’re you favorite local treats/snacks?
13963,I’m an expat and most of us look for fully furnished rentals.
13964,"We’ve also had positive racism (I mean it’s still shit), in that someone was told I was her husband and they get excited and happy she married a white guy."
13965,"We can remove PRC from the discussion because that is more xenophobia shown than racism, I’ll admit."
13966,You must be a PRC as you’re used to having a firewall that blocks foreigners from commenting in your forums and your xenophobia against Americans
13967,I’m currently studying in Brisbane and I agree with you on the level of racism.
13968,I know if my suspicions are true then it’s “just racism” but I can’t even now work on my school assignments I have to do anymore without panicking and having anxiety attacks that I’m just the wrong race to think I can ever succeed in life and I should just give up on my dreams now and make space for the ones worthy of it.
13969,They said that the government is still deciding on whether this VTL is closed or not and will get back to us in the afternoon.
13970,"If the spouses are really foreign talents, they should be able to obtain work permits on their own merit rather than taking the DP loophole."
13971,"Also, does this mean that since people avoid going to Singapore for tech jobs, that chances of getting hired there would be higher for a prospective expat like me (compared to other sectors)?"
13972,It was from a Latvian immigrant who casually referenced me being an American and I remember immediately noticing it and having it stick with me even years later.
13973,I’m not even going via VTL anyway because my job is remote.
13974,I do think the FDW fiasco messed up plans and extended Phase 1 way more than originally intended and caused more economic loss than ideal.
13975,"Racism is racism, even if it’s unintentional or subconscious."
13976,"Even as we try our best to educate people who unknowingly say/do racist things, we shouldn’t hesitate to be honest abt the fact that they are racist."
13977,I’m in sec 2 and believed (until now) that racism towards Indians is normal.
13978,I’m literally doing this next year because of the anti expat policies being brought in.
13979,"As much as the foreign workers are housed in less than ideal conditions that many of us wouldn’t want to live in given a choice, they made the choice to come to Singapore to earn money."
13980,I’m not a scholar but it seems to me that Critical Race Theory is essentially like fighting racism with even more racism.
13981,"It is hypocritical, divisive and racist."
13982,Then Caucasians were also targetted with their lavish expat packages.
13983,"I’m not as informed as I should be on this subject, but I just happened to wonder why is it in other countries, if you move there to work on a workers visa, you’re seen as an immigrant worker but generally your quality of life is the same as anyone else’s minus the extra financial burdens and inability to participate in that country’s politics."
13984,"But foreign workers from India, Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar etc., when they come here, they’re branded differently, like they’re a lower caste of people, living in dormitories and having residents actively shunning and shooing them away from public places."
13985,So guess one person does care about the maids :)
13986,It’s racist because she would easily get PR if she were Chinese ethnicity.
13987,"I’m not exaggerating when I say every expat I know here who doesn’t have kids, and a large percentage of those who do, are considering leaving permanently."
13988,"I’m not sure if the Govt realises how close to breaking point most expats are, but if we get to autumn and the UK, US, EU etc."
13989,"are completely back to normal, and SG is still not allowing travel, and enforcing draconian restrictions, the majority of expats will leave."
13990,"When I say landlords are racist, I am not just basing it on their behaviour and actions, but rather more on their thinking behind their behaviour and actions."
13991,"If that is not racist to you, then I’m not sure what is."
13992,"Yes maybe, but it’s still an extremely racist reason to reject all Indians because of their smell, when not even all Indians smell the same."
13993,"I’m not particularly pro or anti CECA, but if I had to guess it’s the prevalence of Indian foreign talent in major industries in singapore, disproportionately in management and more so than any other foreign talent."
13994,My point is that the foreign workers have a choice to be here.
13995,I’m saying it does matter whether a hypothetical racist person acting out is mentally ill or not.
13996,I’m not claiming that all mentally ill people are racist nor that all racist people are mentally ill.
13997,This guy is racist.
13998,Knows he is racist.
13999,"https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nu6v14/what_is_sexism_in_singapore/  Even in this sub, many don’t think being racist is racist."
14000,It’s not racism pointing that out.
14001,"Since we can see racism prevalent in multiple spheres of activity like schooling, work and housing, racism is pretty systemic, no?"
14002,I’m not sure having a Chinese shop owner bark ‘what you want?’ Is racist - I’m white and they bark the same thing at me.
14003,I’m not sure if foreign domestic worker are same as normal employee in this instance.
14004,Singapore laws place full responsibility for FDWs on the employer.
14005,So it’s not as if the employer can allow the FDW to go stay with her boyfriend at will.
14006,"The employer is responsible to ensure that the FDW is working at the place they are registered at, aka their home."
14007,"If not, the employer is responsible to make sure that the work permit for the FDW is cancelled and that repatriation is arranged by the employer fully paid for the FDW to return back to the home country."
14008,The FDW can inform the employer that she does not wish to work anymore as a maid.
14009,The maid is not allowed to stay in Singapore without a valid work permit.
14010,"And in this respect, all foreign workers too."
14011,"So even if it is not a maid, but a foreign worker who “run away” and does not report for work nor traceable at their registered residential address (all foreign workers have to register with MOM with their residential address before work permit is issued), the employer must lodge a police case to track down the worker."
14012,This is to prevent illegal immigrants from overstaying in Singapore without a proper permit/visa.
14013,In my aunt case of her maid running away to be with her boyfriend.
14014,"I’m not sure what the balance is of expats vs Americans, but there’s a massive expat population in Singapore and if they all fuck off then there will be a lot of grumpy Singaporean landlords with over priced condos and no one to rent them to."
14015,"I’m not sure what their role is now but apparently in the past, when Chinese immigrants made their way from China, their first point of contact would usually be the associations."
14016,I understand the plight of people who scrap together but that is everywhere and irrespective of being expat or not.
14017,"Whether or not the racism is intentional, it still hurts."
14018,"Yes, you can forgive a person once they’ve learned how to not be racist."
14019,And I am not one to advocate for totally shunning people who unconsciously or unintentionally make racist remarks.
14020,Where I draw the line is ignoring the racism in the first place.
14021,"I’m not calling for a crucifixion, mind you, just asking for people to be willing to acknowledge that they may have said/done racist things and actively apologise, not immediately default to defending themselves."
14022,I’m not the one who generalise all foreign workers refuse to integrate in Singapore...  I’m speechless.
14023,"The point of my meme is simply trying to show the hypocrisy of many people here, who would come all out to condemn racism when a racist incident occur in the streets, while simultaneously ignoring the other forms of casual and systemic racism that exist which makes like difficult for minorities as well, especially when it concerns their own pocket and profitability, like in the case of rental discrimination."
14024,Some say a lot of racist jokes towards Indians behind their backs.
14025,Some light skinned expats also join in.
14026,I’m fine with offensive jokes between friends but saying racist jokes towards X when X is not around is not friendly banter and it’s not humor.
14027,"I have no emotional connection to the language, I consider Cantonese my mother tongue."
14028,"I was also probably a really weird kid so classmates and friends would make racist jokes all the time, can’t really remember specifically but I always just laughed along because I’d rather be included than ostracised."
14029,I’m glad it stopped completely in jc and the close friends I made in secondary sort of outgrew racist jokes(mostly HAHA) so it’s all good now I suppose.
14030,"I’ve said from the very start, it is not the decision on who to rent that solely decides if you are sexist/racist/ageists, but more so the thinking behind such a decision."
14031,"But if you’re insinuating that the staff were maliciously racist, I’m not gonna rule that out, seeing as racist incidents have been on a surge lately."
14032,It is true and I agree that the maids should be treated better than soldiers in this case but it has not reach the inhumane level in terms of living conditions at least.
14033,"If expats are leaving (like what’s happening now), it is probable that things are going to shit."
14034,I think (any expat out here care to correct or elaborate?)
14035,Chinese people really have no right to decide what’s racist and what isn’t and I really hope people like you sharing your experiences will help change minds.
14036,I wish I could apologise  to my Indian classmates for all the racist things I said in my primary school & secondary school.
14037,I’m sorry  But I don’t get the problem with this situation   I see this PA issue as a copyright issue not a racism issue
14038,I’m sorry but that is exactly what stereotypes and xenophobia sounds like.
14039,Making racist remarks and disturbing the racial harmony is actually a crime in Singapore
14040,"Grievances against immigration and immigrants are valid if your livelihood has suffered as a consequence of open-door policies, but... the missing kid is a school-going Singaporean."
14041,"Its a fact, some Chinese people are racist."
14042,"Is it safe, any racism etc And is finding a job there difficult considering how much more outspoken westerners are?"
14043,"I’m trying to apply for VTL from US to Singapore (in the eservices website) but after I successfully upload my QR code and hit save, it says it sent an OTP to my mobile phone for verification but I never received anything."
14044,Did they limit the possible vaccine centres serving FDWs to a select few?
14045,"If you think so, you are racist."
14046,I’m very upset that some Singaporean’s do not even treat their helpers/maids like a human being.
14047,"The scary thing is that if it continues, the maid may have a lot of pent up anger and will start doing strange things."
14048,There’s even a Vidsee video about it which garnered a million views on YouTube  Here’s the [short film](https://youtu.be/etkamb0ymrE)   One reason I think this happens is because of people showing their superiority to maids.
14049,"I’m white, but the blatant racism towards Indians when apartment hunting is fucking absurd and complete bullshit."
14050,"You’ll always see the same voices screaming about how singapore needs to be completely open otherwise all expats will leave and Singapore will regress, etc."
14051,"Although I’ve firsthand experience racism during the trip, I’m not aware that simple Chinese greetings are as derogatory as say “Ching Chong Ching Chong”."
14052,Some Chinese Singaporeans (and sometimes other light skinned expats) would make racist jokes towards Indians behind their backs.
14053,"You can view them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ntfy6b/k_shanmugams_thoughts_on_a_recent_incident_of_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ntkmw5/well_i_didnt_expect_this_after_working_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  What I’ve noticed is this, many Singaporeans often like to take the moral high ground when it comes to race, decrying discrimination and racism only when it does not have any discernible impact on them."
14054,"As is the case of the recent viral video which Shanmugam commented, many people came forward to condemn the man who confronted a couple purely on the basis of their race, and most people also agreed that the man was indeed racist."
14055,"Australia often gets a bad rap for racism, but I honestly think it’s sometimes a bit worse here."
14056,"Speaking personally, I’d never experienced racism at all until I came here."
14057,I’ve heard from my grandma’s maid that other people give their maids leftover food.
14058,I’ve known people with less salary than you but had employment pass.
14059,There are many maid employment agencies.
14060,"But they are usually domestic workers, meaning they live with you and take care of Housekeeping / meals."
14061,"Having a temp-maid is possible, but not the norm."
14062,"As a brown singaporean, I’ve faced more racism in my own country (Singapore) than I ever did in London (basically faced no ACTUAL racism there) and Perth (definitely not as bad as SG, but still some racism here & there)..."
14063,I’m also of a minority race and have genuinely faced less racism in the UK as compared to Singapore.
14064,Absolutely no racism in Canada.
14065,Somehow if I visit safetravel website I get the feeling that pass holders still need employers to submit and get an approval from MoM to get in (which is not at all a given for most countries but for VTL it might be?
14066,JB SG VTL is more for people going back to visit family.
14067,"No one is going that kind of money for testing just to go ""shopping""  Like the Bolehland MP said, SG don't want VTL with Bolehland so we can keep the money in Singapore"
14068,not^racist^really^im^not
14069,Jade say her maid positive.
14070,Jail finish already please banish this maid..
14071,Jailed her and lifetime ban her from having maid in her house hold!
14072,Jane should sue for the employer and maid for PTSD
14073,"Japan has re-opened its borders, but it needs to sort out the 370,000 stranded foreign workers/students first."
14074,Japan is actually the best textbook example of why we shouldn't be xenophobic.
14075,"Actually I think other countries have ""maids"" also, but they almost never have general purpose live-in maids (except aupairs which are far more uncommon unlike maids here)."
14076,"It's not Singapore don't want to do VTL, if I'm Japanese government I wouldn't want to risk it too and tank my popularity."
14077,(I'm flying from Japan back to SG for the new year and I don't expect VTL to happen by then sadly)
14078,Japan's immigration policy has radically changed and immigrant numbers have gone up substantially over the past few years.
14079,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/23/japan-immigration-policy-xenophobia-migration/
14080,Japanese hot minute maid taste pretty nice
14081,"Japanese xenophobia is more subtle but I really don't know about ""worse""."
14082,Singapore is literally made up of immigrants but we still carry this completely fake notion of what is a true blue Singaporean.
14083,"If you are working for an MNC, the best route to make a circle of friends and gain introductions to other people would be through the other expat colleagues; as you probably know already, there is a relatively large western expat community here, mostly working in the CBD."
14084,I paid my maid in Manila 2000PHP per *week*.
14085,If you live abroad and get to deal with racism against Chinese you would learn not to be such a wanker
14086,Jesus Christ that was the ONLY xenophobic/below the belt/off-track question.
14087,You made it sound as though the thread was CRAWLING with racism.
14088,"First off, the reason the maid’s passport is kept by the employer is such that they do not just leave whenever they want to."
14089,"Just to let you know, there are already TONS of cases where the maid has fled the country not because they are mistreated, but because they just didn’t feel like staying anymore."
14090,"And when they do that, the employers are the one who suffer, and pay a lot more $$$ as well as the cost of having to find a NEW maid."
14091,"Secondly, maids should not have a boyfriend because they can just easily bring their boyfriend to the employer’s house, and who knows what they do."
14092,And yeah a lot of the Singaporeans have this disgusting mindset towards filipinos because of how we have maids here who are domestic workers.
14093,"Its so disgusting to say ""but it's history/heritage"" when it promotes racism."
14094,"Jialat man, hope this generation really can break this horrible treatment of domestic helpers as slaves."
14095,I feel educating the next generation is the way to beat racism.
14096,Jo Teo: I've not come across any migrant workers demanding an apology yet or feeling like a cattle.
14097,"Also, no migrant workers have asked for an apology yet."
14098,Having to more frequently deal with racism.
14099,"Join the Facebook groups, they are more expat friendly."
14100,Search for Singapore expats - there are tonnes of them.
14101,Join the ‘Travelling in and out of Singapore” group on Facebook to stay updated on border measures and how foreigners living here are handling them.
14102,"(Replying to a reporter's question on whether anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of workers)  And now, Josephine ""[I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/migrant-worker-no-apology-jo-teo/)"" Teo."
14103,(When asked if the government will consider apologising to migrant workers)  True colours *always* show.
14104,Jss doesn't fund foreign workers.
14105,"She had also told the maid agency that she wanted to run away, but was convinced to stay to provide for her three children back home in the Philippines."
14106,"*  Seriously though, a helpless migrant worker alone in a foreign land who had repeatedly sought help from quite possibly the only viable source of assistance known to her but received no help."
14107,How many FDWs know how to or are able to seek help beyond their own agencies?
14108,These agencies care more about their profits and self-interests than the well-being of FDWs.
14109,It is now up to AGC to take action against the Liew Clan for falsification of charges against the maid and character assassination.
14110,The maid should be compensated accordingly.
14111,"Judging by the comments here, not many seem to realise that the VTL scheme was never meant to specifically target the leisure traffic."
14112,Why the VTL is critical because business travellers cannot be in quarantine for 7D nor is it viable to be paying for multiple PCR tests.
14113,"For now, I'm pleased for the VTL as it is less risk compared to a non-VTL fight."
14114,Judging ppl by nature of their skin color is racist.
14115,Judging someone's ability to do their job by the color of their skin isn't racism?
14116,"If like that everyone can just bury their racist sentiments under the pretense of ""preference"" right?"
14117,- I prefer to sit beside certain race on the mrt  - I prefer to be served by certain race in restaurant  - I prefer to hire certain race in my company   So Singapore has no racism.
14118,"Jumping off from this [post](http://https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5mx56q/job_prospects_for_singaporean_expats_thinking_of/) , recent Canadian uni graduate was wondering what the outlook is like for new grads in Singapore."
14119,"Just a note, racism crimes are very rare in the UK, so a few criminal incidents in a city might push the percentage up by a significant amount."
14120,"Just a note, they’ve updated a couple of the above points:  You do need to do a pre departure ART from Cat II and above whether or not the flight is VTL, so keep that in mind!"
14121,who get disheartened by this community using false equivalencies left right and center to cover their racist bullshit.
14122,Just allow the maid  to abuse the idiots the same way
14123,"Just an opinion, but I feel that Singapore is more xenophobic than racist."
14124,"Openly xenophobic as well, but yea, racism is alot less obvious, but it's there."
14125,"Younger male US expat, what are some walkable places to hang out tonight?"
14126,"Just as for cars, there shd be insurance as well in case the immigrant f****s up."
14127,"Just as you seem to know more about what expats can do and what they cannot, I know more about expats in SG and their situation in SG than an ""ever-complaining local"" who does not even take efforts to know what expats have to go through."
14128,"Just be careful though despite getting a PR, you may still be labelled an outsider because this country is still very racist."
14129,Just because an action/comment is not overt or not imposed on others doesn’t mean it automatically downgrades from being racism to mere racial preferences.
14130,Most of the racist actions against minorities are indeed subtle.
14131,Just because racism is worse in other places doesnt mean singapore is paradise.
14132,Just because she is your maid doesn't mean you can confiscate her property at will or lock her in.
14133,Just because some fuckers are racist doesn’t mean the whole world is.
14134,How much due diligence have u conducted as before your conclusion about EDMW HWZ being “ignored” by the government  The irony is that reddit is probably an even worst platform for “xenophobia and normalized racism” 😂 double standards much
14135,"Just by reading the comments here, you can clearly tell she is right about Singaporeans' attitude when it comes to racism."
14136,"Instead of acknowledging there is racism in Singapore, people rather choose to attack her and be extremely defensive to preserve the perfect Singapore bubble."
14137,"I even applaud that fact people think it's okay to say racist stuffs because ""It's only a joke!""."
14138,"Worst still, people here are actually moving the goalpost to decide what is racist and what is not."
14139,"""Abusing a maid is not racist, it's just power trip!"""
14140,"""Racist jokes are not racist, just different humour!"""
14141,"BEST ONE  ""I'm not racist because I have Malay/Indian friends and they love my insensitive jokes!"""
14142,"Just chiming in, not going to debate the morality of your arguments but to note that the reality is more nuanced than ""It pays more than what they would have been paid back home""  A look at this [article](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/third-foreign-domestic-workers-singapore-debt-half-have-no-bank-account-report) will show that a recent study found half of domestic workers do not have access to a bank account and one-third are in debt, and as case studies from various migrant worker organisations have exhibited, are often due to exploitative practices by employers and middlemen."
14143,"Just come out and say it man, foreign workers have horrible hygiene right?"
14144,We should learn to treat FDWs like a fellow colleague in the office.
14145,"If you are the employer of a FDW, then treat her with respect like how you want your boss to treat you in the office."
14146,"Don’t forget, FDWs are just here to earn a living too, just like how we go to work for a monthly salary."
14147,"Just curious if i can travel via VTL from Sg to Kuala Lumpur , and then from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching?"
14148,Just curious since you asked this question - have you encountered any racism towards you in the US?
14149,"Just curious, what are some things you would like to see done more for domestic helpers?"
14150,"Just did mine, hopefully the migrant worker friends can have a good day!"
14151,"Just do a quick search it's not that hard to find:  [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/maid-jailed-for-stealing-cash-and-jewellery-for-over-a-year-12714226](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/maid-jailed-for-stealing-cash-and-jewellery-for-over-a-year-12714226)  Honestly, AGC will only charge the worker if they have confidence that they can secure a conviction"
14152,"Just do this loh:  People say need to take better care of migrant workers but when it comes to actually paying for it, all run away"
14153,"This gets you a 2-3 bedroom condo in River Valley (expat area) with a great view, or in the CBD are."
14154,Just don't take mother tongue lor
14155,"You know, like social conventions where there are some things that are true (like your racist preferences) but you don’t say out loud?"
14156,"Just dropping by to encourage everyone to donate to HOME, TWC2 and other migrant worker non-government organisations~"
14157,Just embrace racism but don’t blow it out of proportion.
14158,Very often the public or the gov blows it out of proportion over a sporadic racist case.
14159,Many racist cases are actually not racist at all.
14160,"In some work place if Chinese boss promote Chinese staff and not a Malay or Indian staff, the Malay or Indian say the Chinese boss is racist."
14161,When Indian calls a Chinese “Chinese punk” it’s considered not so racist but if it’s vice versa it’s very racist.
14162,In this way other racist people will become less racist when they get to know them more.
14163,"CMIO - How are the races determined; for example, I was born in Germany, but my parents (and citizenship/nationality) are British/Caucasian."
14164,"Do you think that, outside of the CMIO, the government discriminates more (eg, they prefer Europeans over other SEA nations) because the human (who in the end are people like you) behind the application will automatically (i.e bias themselves to) think that the applicant will do more to integrate?"
14165,Just establish more fancy eateries around the expat living areas.
14166,"If you don’t have that kind of money, you would be better off getting a job with a local company willing to sponsor your employment pass."
14167,Which is precisely why I know kids brought up in Chinese speaking traditional families tend to be indoctrinated with subtle racism against the minorities.
14168,"Of course Indians and Malay can be racist too, but what I'm speaking about based on my observations the majority, the Singaporean Chinese people."
14169,Just get rid of VTL altogether so stupid that a direct flight on Monday is VTL and the same flight on Tuesday is 10 days home quarantine.
14170,Just give maids incentives
14171,"Singapore is as racist as it gets,but only behind closed doors."
14172,You would rarely find racists doing racist stuff like bullying an indian or another minority openly in public.
14173,Nearly all my indian friends are racist.
14174,"They call chinese people: munjen ,the malays i know are not exactly racist but they tend to practice favouritism and nepotism when it comes down to making decisions."
14175,"Just googling, racism is defined as: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particularly racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalised."
14176,Why is this incident racist?
14177,"It reveals the PA’s blind spot in representing our minority races, but here’s what moves it from ignorance to outright racism: no one realised that they weren’t accurately representing a minority race."
14178,"And given how central race is in Singapore (eg CMIO), that’s pretty staggering."
14179,"Ultimately, they either didn’t have Malay people who could advise them on Malay culture and representation, which would reveal an organisational culture of systemic racism, or they didn’t care to do the research, which is good ol’ fashioned casual racism."
14180,Belgium will be included in VTL scheme from March 16.
14181,"It's like why many households don't allow their maids to eat meals at the same time as the rest of the family, or even ever at the dining table that's reserved for the family."
14182,Instead the maid must eat only at some corner of the kitchen.
14183,Or they don't allow the maids to ever sit on the sofa (instead the maid is only ever allowed to sit on the floor).
14184,"No need to meet quota, no reservist, no foreign worker levy"
14185,Some of them are even racist to their own countrymen despite speaking and understanding  their language..
14186,Just in general I find myself thinking racist thoughts.
14187,"I was never racist ever, but somehow now that I live with so many different cultures and ethnicity's."
14188,Just in the last few days there were a few posts on here by indian Singaporeans or PRs who wont get an apartment because of racism.
14189,Just insist the domestic helper is a butler.
14190,"Just let them be on the exact same rules as us ffs…  If you think about it, what's fundamentally different with the migrant workers than our NSFs?"
14191,"If the NSFs coming out isn't too much of a risk, why are the migrant workers a risk or at more risk?"
14192,"Just like those people who go: ""I am not a racist but...."""
14193,"Whenever you think trace together is awful, keep in mind how nobody is brave enough to speak out for foreign workers who are still imprisoned."
14194,"All he did was say ""LOL, You don't know what I know and I don't tell you, so you cannot talk or you are racist!"""
14195,"Just look at how our foreign workers in construction are being treated, paints a pretty good picture of the state's priorities."
14196,"Just look at how we even term the covid cases, ""community spread"" vs ""dormitory cases"" because yea, dormitory people don't count as community  ""we wanted labour, but people showed up"" and then we didnt know what to do so we built gated communities to keep them away from the rest of us."
14197,"Just look at the conditions which they live in, being housed as tightly as possible...  &#x200B;  I knew that the dormitories which housed foreign workers was the elephant in the room long before the authorities had an inkling of what they had proposed to house them in cluster would easily spread the disease like wildfire."
14198,"I understand my options are probably the S-pass (most likely) and some other employment pass (E-pass, I think)."
14199,My own thoughts towards mainland Chinese immigrants who come here for education and job opportunities is largely neutral.
14200,I feel that there is a fear that an increased amount of mainland Chinese immigrants will cause our own identity will be eroded because of theirs.
14201,Hence the fear that one day China might turn against us which results in us spurning mainland Chinese immigrants.
14202,"Just my penny of thought: Real racism would be when a certain race always find themselves thinking they are superior to other races, preferential treatment on all social levels and passing on racists remarks casually off the streets."
14203,"Most people will rather be publicly known as a drama queen, a racist or even a cheat than be recognised as a molester."
14204,"Recently, xenophobia in Singapore has begun to take centre-stage, as the Covid-19 pandemic threatens livelihoods, causing much anxiety and frustration to be directed towards foreign expatriates working in Singapore."
14205,"Certainly, an open economy such as Singapore cannot afford to allow xenophobic sentiments to run rampant, even as the government needs to recognise the importance of protecting the livelihoods of Singaporeans."
14206,"And of course, while legitimate concerns on Singapore's foreign workforce must be heard, racist remarks of any kind need to be swiftly condemned."
14207,"Quite contrary to the often borderline xenophobic discussions online centred around the jobs market in Singapore, there is a separate strain of xeno""philia"" when it comes to educational discourse, both online and offline."
14208,It got me thinking what if the history take a wrong turn and Gurmit Singh was accused of racism/stereotyping/cultural appropriations and the script writer got fired or arrested.
14209,Just outlaw live-in immigrant maids and develop the childcare and house cleaning service industries like modern society already.
14210,The only exception should be trained medical maids for the elderly and infirm.
14211,"Just pointing out that 1) you're not factoring in their lack of education background (you should be familiar with the financial model where the more educated you are, the higher you're paid) and 2) they are live in domestic helper, meaning rent, water and electricity bill, and food are all covered by the employers (average one room rent would be a few hundred bucks, add another 50 bucks for utilities, and another few hundred bucks for meals)."
14212,Meanwhile VTL to the UK only requires a declaration form with 0 tests and most places are already masks off.
14213,Just remember Singaporeans aren't all (probably not even mostly) racist scum.
14214,And if you're lucky say a few racists thing or two while you're at it.
14215,Just scrap the VTL scheme.
14216,The whole world is already moving on and we are stuck here with the antiquated mindset of VTL.
14217,If they get any one wrong it's obviously racism and cultural appropriation.
14218,"Just so happens, today an expat friend was sharing with me how she is working on getting PR for her family right now."
14219,Just tell them that their parents or grandparents were foreign workers last time too.
14220,There is definitely no overt malicious racism that you described in Singapore towards any race.
14221,"Racism in Singapore is more subtle and many a times Singaporeans don't know they are being racist, hence the comments you see below."
14222,"It's subtle things like jokes about your skin colour ""can't see you in the dark hahaha"" and jokes about ""blangas"" (term for blangadeshi foreign workers which is definitely derogatory)."
14223,"For example, as horrible as it sounds, tiny bathrooms for maids are considered normal sadly, but what you've described - making her shower from the mop bucket - isn't normal."
14224,We've recently had some high-profile (and unsurprising) tragic cases of maid abuse / death so I think MOM would be responsive to allegations of mistreatment during this period.
14225,The Christian bit being a pretty big deal (we have so many stories of bloggers getting charged in court for racist comments).
14226,"Tons and tons of racist stuff people say all day, especially behind closed doors."
14227,"And I also want to remind people that your rice bowl is not only threatened by CECA, also CCP."
14228,"Just turn all flights into VTL flights, let people arrive from all countries as long as vaccinated, scrap pre departure tests and end this administrative mess."
14229,That was a bit simpler because it was not linked to festering racism among the majority Chinese community here against minority races.
14230,"I suspect a lot of the same sentiments are at play now but with that added layer of racism, and it might be useful to look at that wave of animosity against the PRCs to see where this is going and why."
14231,"After being overseas for a few years i came back to singapore, and the amount of racist words my friends and assoc were spewings was just insane."
14232,"10 years ago may be accetable to be so overtly racist, but cant keep living in the past la"
14233,The biggest irony is that my mom is an immigrant and cheated her way when she was in school.
14234,"Regarding my point about my mom being an immigrant, I am not sure she got sucked up in the kiasu-ness."
14235,I have ex-colleagues who are also immigrants and they are the most chill folks and don't pressure their kids at all.
14236,Just wanted to chime in that certain racist jokes might seem harmless when said but do spread a negative stereotype that can cause actual harm.
14237,The casual racism in Singapore is not as simple as that.
14238,"We should also recognize that this deliberate approach goes against the grain of how most other countries crafted their educational policies, where a nation's mother tongue remains the first language of its population, taught earlier on in students' lives, with English adopted as a second language taught only much later on."
14239,"A large number of Singaporean Chinese are already resistant to embracing their own mother tongue and culture - I think this is a point that is often overlooked by some non-Chinese who attribute too much ""Chinese-ness"" to us purely on the basis of race."
14240,I don't usually comment on this sub but stories like these highlight all of the deeply entrenched racism here at home that goes unaddressed while I was too busy focusing on overseas politics.
14241,I've tried to change their minds and argue about other matters in the past but they still hold to their prejudices so I don't see any success in getting them to get rid of their racist beliefs.
14242,Are there any groups in Singapore that focuses on the addressing racism directed towards Malay and Indian people and make things better or should we make our own?
14243,"Just wondering, so employers get penalised for maids running away?"
14244,I remember I got an aunt whose maid ran away whilst on the way to pick up her kid from school.
14245,She did not mentioned much after that on any penalty on her but I remember the maid was found by the police and deported after.
14246,My aunt did not know she had a boyfriend as she don’t want to intrude too much into her maid’s privacy.
14247,The maid had access to the wifi for her phone.
14248,"She say she is simply suay to kena this, she even suspect the maid brought her boyfriend home when no ones at home."
14249,"After this incident, she had to go down to the police station couple of times to settle the case, she had to pay to send the maid back, forfeit her agent fees, fork out few k for agents fees for new maid etc."
14250,I remember her being more strict with her new maid after that.
14251,"But she found a maid that is ok with getting compensated in lieu of off days every week, and gave one off day per month instead."
14252,"First, he attacks an Australian anti-racism bill, claiming (with little substantiation) that it's meant to protect ""Muslims and Jews"":  > It is painfully obvious that this “Racial Vilification Bill” is aimed at protecting the interests of minority groups such as Muslims and Jews, certainly not Christians!"
14253,The rest is pretty subjective but getting a maid to do office work is clearly illegal.
14254,How many cases of abuse out of all the foreigners domestic helpers?
14255,it's 2k for VTL but 3k roundtrip
14256,Meanwhile ban our true mother tongues from media use.
14257,Imagine one day of the foreign workers in the container port would go on strike.
14258,Keep playing victim and blaming racism plus God knows what else for your perceived shortcomings.
14259,"Singapore passport isn't ""tainted"" with a reputation or racist fears in the same way a Pakistani or Yemeni or Ethiopian passport might be."
14260,"Keep the expats no problemmmm, but i also want to splurge le."
14261,Don't call yourself and expat.
14262,"I think the unfortunate thing is hate and anger usually is more likely to fuel online comments than, yknow, a Singaporean actively wanting to praise CECA."
14263,So just know there’s a silent majority that doesn’t blame CECA for the loss of jobs.
14264,"Keeping in context to what OP has asked us to do, which is to stand up and be counted against racism."
14265,"How can you first, let the community insinuate that most Chinese are racist, then ask them to stand up for minorities?"
14266,OP doesn't say Chinese people are racist but there are big pockets of minorities doing this.
14267,"Next is where we disagree, while I agree we are better placed to educate our ""own"" the problem comes is when we are trying to determine what is racist or what is not?"
14268,"Better idea would be we compartmentalize generalizations, and call out racist acts on a case by case basis, with minorities leading the way."
14269,But many people who have hired a maid will tell you they do it.
14270,"Agencies will tell employers to ask the maid to sign over the passport to your safekeeping, (which is legal)."
14271,"Keeping the passport has some practical considerations - for example, my colleague's case was that the maid stole stuff from his house and went home when he was on holiday, never to be seen again."
14272,There have also been cases where maids whom the employer or agent wishes to send home for one reason or other- deliberately 'lose' their passport.
14273,Some maids have also never held a passport before and dont know the importance of one- and if they lose it it can be a big hassle.
14274,Keeping racist mindsets quiet doesn’t change mindsets.
14275,Keyboard warriors talking about racism.
14276,"Kicking myself for accidentally booking a non-VTL flight for 4 of us, then spending 2k to upgrade it to a VTL flight and now we could have taken the other one lol"
14277,But the foreign worker might have experienced something similar in the past so that's why he assumed it was his skin.
14278,"I am not going to raise my kids to be racist, but I'm not going to raise them to trust the Nigerians in Roppongi when they travel there in their young adult life either."
14279,"I agree though, POC Indians can be extremely fucking racist."
14280,"Yes, we get it, Singapore can't live without our dear expats without which the country will run itself to the ground etc etc."
14281,"Obviously that never happened, but with the VTL flights, visiting is at least a possibility now."
14282,"Kinda related but not related, but I felt that I was selected for my internship based on my race (mother tongue) and it made me super insecure and contributed to my sense of worthlessness and self-doubt."
14283,Is it because NSFs don't have a choice but migrant workers made the choice to come here?
14284,"Knee jerk xenophobic reaction, this one ಥ_ಥ  Edit: hijacking my bad joke to add -- I hope we don't look back on this decision as ""too little too late""."
14285,Kokila Annamalai is a prominent migrant worker activist with experience on the ground!
14286,Kristen Han should go out on the streets and ask migrant workers whether they would leave Singapore if they could with no strings attached.
14287,"I am sure that the fact your maid sees you and your parents doing this, it is helping her cope with the shit."
14288,Saw the same thing happen with a friend of mine --- his maid was very appreciative of the efforts.
14289,Some of them are racist but they need to be judged from the historical context / era they were said in.
14290,"For instance, Gandhi himself could be considered a racist in modern times because of his views on blacks but his opinion was the norm back then: https://www.npr.org/2019/10/02/766083651/gandhi-is-deeply-revered-but-his-attitudes-on-race-and-sex-are-under-scrutiny   I don't condone what some of LKY said about the racial stereotypes even from a historical context."
14291,"But then he continued spewing his racist nonsense, so what does he know."
14292,"LKY is a racist, and it is obvious."
14293,LKY is a racist….
14294,Re: different varying degree of racism.
14295,LKY made the point in 2010 that they would start dialing back foreign worker numbers.
14296,"In other words, foreign worker numbers should be less than 2010's which LKY had deemed to be too high already."
14297,"I'm not dismissing what Mahathir says, I just don't see how it is relevant to the question of was LKY racist."
14298,"Your position seems to beg the question - Does a ""racial leader"" saying the same thing mean that the original view is not racist?"
14299,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8rPofi-AUw&t=15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8rPofi-AUw&t=17s)   But is he racist?
14300,"If he was truly racist, he could have made Singapore into a dominant Chinese only country where minorities are mistreated."
14301,"LKY was racist, he was world famous."
14302,He probably wasn't world famous for being racist though.
14303,LOL NS is where I met the hardcore racist supremacists.
14304,I believe Singaporeans are not that heartless and it is in the interest of Singaporeans to take into consideration the well being of the migrant workers as we hugely dependent on them for our economy.
14305,> Really hope the government can work something out for the migrant workers cause I don't think it is healthy for someone to be coop up for months and months on end.
14306,"LOL at first when i saw the photo of ""Mr Alex Tan Zhixiang"", I thought it was the racist china guy."
14307,LOL at how with racism in Singapore you can't even discuss who it involves.
14308,"I have no idea what the racism accusation against him involves (was it by a Chinese Sing, or Indian Sing, or Malay Sing or whatever)."
14309,"LOL for the 5th time, I'm not in any way being adamant on being called an expat (I don't walk around boasting about it in any way, shape or form)."
14310,It was simply a word to describe my situation (which is true since I'm an expat in Australia).
14311,What about the racist abuses that the football players face?
14312,Its pretty clear racists in the US are more likely to be the gun nut anti govt militia types
14313,"Its every employer's fault that the maid is getting abused by elderly, not the elderly."
14314,passenger => air port staff => VTL ticket freeze..   source.
14315,"), restrictions on migrant workers, GST hike, no GST hike, just from the top of my head."
14316,"Sounds like sour grapes from a self-centered, closed-minded person who only wanted to date expats."
14317,"LWM self pwn not prepared and doesn't know jack shit about CECA, FTA etc"
14318,"I'm sure there's racist people voting in the UK, but it's a reach to say labor lost because people are actually racist deep down."
14319,"The original referendum probably had tons of racist undertones (or just overtones), but the issue is different now several years on."
14320,"Don't say look down on foreign workers, Singaporeans would look down on fellow Singaporeans that come from poorer backgrounds."
14321,"In the end they don't realize, their racism is hurting them."
14322,Landlords who discriminate based on race are being racist.
14323,"It’s literally the definition of racism: >Racism (noun) prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized."
14324,What those racist landlords in this sub are really saying is that their purchase of property has endowed them the right to be racist.
14325,"Language is the basis for a functioning society  the onus to communicate clearly is on the speaker  if the speaker had a non-xenophobic thought but poorly articulate such that it sounded xenophobic, the blame is on the speaker  This is why communication skills matters"
14326,Lanjiao la   Talk like they not racist or xenophobic like that   Spf navy air force fake one ah   Pm cannot be minority fake one ah
14327,"Large family, multiple pets, big house, the second maid is really there to help the first maid, she comes on that extra day just to do laundry and stuff, we usually eat out on that day."
14328,"It's not like we can't cook for ourselves, it's just that having that extra maid places less stress on our current one which creates a more efficient working system for her."
14329,One thing about racist jokes though.
14330,They don’t necessarily make *you* racist for saying them.
14331,But a racist joke doesn’t stop being racist just because it is spoken in good company.
14332,"Last time I bought food from Muslim stall, the aunty anyhow charge me but I also never say racist!"
14333,School is racist.
14334,"If local jobs are under threat, why should expat jobs be an exception?"
14335,"Quoting the tweets with the videos and saying things like (examples, not exact quotes):  “Only Chinese ppl will do this kind of thing” “I don’t want to say but you know ah what race will do this”  When the Malay uncle hurled racist remarks at the lady filming, he was called a hero, a savage."
14336,"When it was reported that the same uncle was being investigated for racist remarks, people said it was Chinese privilege because the persons filming were not investigated."
14337,Reacting to racism with more racism.
14338,I would’ve expected the younger generation to be paving the way to eliminate racism in Singapore.
14339,Later the migrant workers throw away again lol.
14340,Launching VTL only via BatamFast.
14341,Lawrence Wong literally said 'racism still exists in Singapore'.
14342,"But I also have seen other agents who don't care, who just see it as a numbers game, whose Chinese privilege means they don't think it's racist."
14343,Lawyers have a code specifically disallowing them from following racist clients' instructions?
14344,Learn their mother tongue as in their own or Chinese?
14345,"That's on top of learning subjects like chemistry, physics, biology, D&T, home economics, PE, English, mother tongue, music, moral education, history, art, social studies and CCA?"
14346,"Learning to tolerate racism when it comes to jokes or like small stereotypes is okay for me, because we all mess up sometimes and we all have such thoughts but I’m totally not okay when the racism determines whether or not you’ll get the job."
14347,"It might cause some friction, or might even cause some racist behavior to come to the surface."
14348,"If certain values that are taught in SAP schools do indeed lead to less racism and better understanding, all the more it should be applied in all schools."
14349,"I'm minority race and the instructor always asked if I was a foreign worker, can speak English, and would criticize foreign worker drivers when we passed them on the road."
14350,Next time everybody should be more careful before displaying racist acts in public.
14351,The last 20 years were the best time for a broader range of expats ever.
14352,Leaving this up despite the reports as an example of how racist thinking is still endemic in our part of the world.
14353,"This registration is somewhat important as it determines things like mother tongue taken at school, public housing quota allotment, etc."
14354,The only “right” way to treat a maid is to pay a liveable wage.
14355,Legit the worst racism I've seen in 6 years living here as a minority.
14356,VTL seems more for overseas visitors or business travelers at its current state.
14357,Anti immigrant stance increasing in lot of countries no matter how much Reddit you put bruh.
14358,Sorry she doesn’t get a free pass for being racist even if she has mental problems
14359,Let her go and then live without a domestic worker or get a new one.
14360,Let him do community service wearing the anime maid outfit
14361,"Sg is great if you're on the expat package and earning upwards of 6k a month, excluding bonuses."
14362,"This stoicism can in some circumstances turn into a sort of tunnel vision - it's like apathy, you start to ignore either injustices you see in society, like the way pple treat the foreign labourers or maids, or how people squeeze into the train, or how the politicians are playing politics/preserving their power base but they like to act as if they are looking after the people's interests."
14363,Let me answer your question with another question Why all the domestic workers are women?
14364,"This  in my view, it is racist."
14365,Is it racist to assume particular race will cause wear and tear?
14366,"If we use your solutions, demand for domestic workers will plunge."
14367,Let me consult the grand high panel of racism…  They say *you* figure it out.
14368,"And paying a foreign worker 2k here- they still have to pay rent, and if they are married, pay school fees/healthcare."
14369,"Singapore has a high standard of living, but the average white male here is a high flying expat who earns within the top 10% of SG salary or more."
14370,"Post colonial hangover makes the impact worse, but it's not as bad as the expat + pop culture dominance effect IMO."
14371,"Let me give u an example of a racist act:  - asking for a Singaporean nurse to jab u because u had a good experience with a Singaporean nurse before  Yes, it is true that some people that are in a region might be better than others but that doesnt mean u dont look at the bangladeshi contractors."
14372,"When u default to German contractors, it is racist because u are assuming they will make good work."
14373,"And if and when i do that, i would have been racist."
14374,You're a Singaporean that had your first experience of racism in Australia when you went to uni.
14375,"Let me just say this: foreign worker living conditions will never be a voter issue, heck, not even in other countries."
14376,"Do you see Qataris/Emiratis/Saudis protesting/caring about the welfare of their foreign workers, who literally make world headlines for inhumane treatment?"
14377,"* The legal protection of the rights of Foreign Domestic Worker for a fair and safe work environment  Have you seen how common people routinely see FDWs as ""inferior"" humans?"
14378,"Since FDWs can't vote, addressing their issue hurts the pockets of those who hire them, who unfortunately, have much of a say as you do in the ballot box."
14379,"Most families rely on FDWs and the last thing they want is to not get their ""value for money""."
14380,"Let me make you a deal, the next time you see someone say racism against the majority is not racism, tag me."
14381,"Let me offer some counter perspectives  >As mentioned in parliament, and of official government records, let's reiterate that CECA does not allow the free movement of natural persons (i.e."
14382,Under [chapter 9](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/Chapter9_Movement_of_Natural_Persons) Singaporeans and Indians are granted entry to India and Singapore for various periods (2month to 3 years).
14383,The main concern about **temporary** foreign workers is 2 fold:  1.
14384,This means the economy may not benefit as much if locals were hired since local spending would spend more in the local economy than foreign workers 2.
14385,"Path dependence - by hiring foreign workers, we ignore the more important question of developing the local workforce."
14386,"Business may choose to simply get foreign workers and not invest in technology/schooling to train the next generation.Taken to the extreme, this means a continued dependency on foreign labor because we lack the infrastructure to shift to a local workforce even when cost of foreign worker increase to match the local workforce."
14387,"That is not to say the net impact of CECA is negative, in fact, I believe it is the opposite, but currently, we have too little data to make any conclusion on the magnitude of the impact."
14388,This image WILL be accepted by the Singapore VTL application website.
14389,"So yes, indeed maids are abused, contrary to what you said, in the form of grotesque underpayment for their hard labour."
14390,"Adjusting to a higher cost of maids will be a slight sting to our wallets, but it is the right thing to do."
14391,"Finally, Using another country’s mistreatment of maids to justify our own is akin to saying murder is right because everyone else is doing it."
14392,"Let the non-chinese OP administer the vaccination to this racist fuck, of course."
14393,1 scenario under stress with a maid there.
14394,If fail no maid.
14395,Either way racism will still be an issue.
14396,Humans are inherently tribal and the most effective thing to combat racism is exposure and education to an extent.
14397,"Just don't go the way of saying racism doesn't exist and being dismissive of ""rare"" occurrences."
14398,Is it because of their racist narrative that people jump straight to the racism conclusion?
14399,Let's ban all businesses in Singapore from hiring foreign workers.
14400,Let's be frank about it and not pretend that China and CCP doesn't invite that hate purely due to xenophobia and not partly because of the things the Chinese govt has done.
14401,"Let's be honest here, she not only owes an apology to migrant workers but to all the healthcare workers whose workload has been increased exponentially because of inability to regulate the dorm operators."
14402,"This immigration policy is not only bad for immediate quality of life, but a long run demographic timebomb."
14403,"Let's come up with an analysis:  Malaysia:  Brain drain  Congestion  Increase of prices of goods  Singaporeans, PRs and expats driving up property prices, buying bungalows, which is a pipe dream in SG, causing the average JBer to be unable to buy property in their own hometown  Singapore:  More Malaysians who are willing to undercut Singaporean wages flooding into Singapore, driving down local wages  Deprecation of SG property prices with more and more people living in JB  Improving the causeway would only benefit a small group of people (Malaysians working in Singapore, and Singaporeans enjoying bungalows at low prices in Malaysia)."
14404,This is also not considering the more technical positions where productive techniques are acquired are often filled by foreign talent due to our labor policy of prioritizing technical skill in foreign migrants.
14405,"A movement to remove these ""latent racism"" perhaps needs to begin at the grass-root levels - I find that the marginalization often start from the family unit."
14406,Let's hope one day there won't be any more maids in SG.
14407,Let's hope they add South Korea to the VTL list soon.
14408,Let's just say China turned CECA down.
14409,"Meanwhile, the sec-gen of NTUC said:  >Two accidents last month have shown that trucks and lorries should not be used to transport migrant workers, and the labour movement is working with partners to push for the implementation of different transport arrangements as soon as possible, said National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong on Sunday (May 9)."
14410,So many foreign workers are getting it will still impact us as it will use up resources
14411,Let's not psychoanalyse the racist?
14412,"If you're a racist, you're a racist."
14413,The reasoning behind you're racism doesn't really matter.
14414,"It may account for one's sentiments but it doesn't excuse them, for they are still are a racist prick."
14415,I'm not 100% sure about the Scandinavian countries but I'm extremely familiar with Canada and that place is racist af if you can pick up on the subtle racism.
14416,"Of course the bigger metropolitan areas (like Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver) are better but tribalism is very very very common there there is ample amount of racism to go around."
14417,"Nevertheless, people these days love to flash that racism card and take offence at everything."
14418,"The locals are willing to do it for x dollars, while any expat will ask for 1.5x."
14419,"Let's see if these ""expats""  will get work lass revoked."
14420,"IE, one set of rules for ""residents"",  one for MW,  and one for ""expats""."
14421,Many Singaporeans are racist and treat others poorly.
14422,"Re: CECA, I can empathise with the anger I’ve witnessed on these forums and within my social circles."
14423,What value and benefits have CECA brought to Singaporeans?
14424,Maybe you can seal off other VTLs but not Singapore-Malaysia VTL?
14425,"-> Remove liability from Employer, if their maid got pregnant/run away."
14426,"-> Remove upfront cost from Employer, let maid have installment plan directly with agencies for the cost incur for agencies to bring them here."
14427,Letting people pull shit like this is indirectly encouraging racism its not about being sensitive or not but sending a message its not okay to do shit like this especially in sg where racial tolerance (yes not acceptance but to maintain peace with one another)and not making fun of any specific race
14428,Let’s be clear:  very few PMET jobs require foreign workers.
14429,Its the government’s fault for neglecting the living conditions of foreign workers beforehand.
14430,Though public attitude towards migrant workers can definitely be improved.
14431,"Let’s not for a moment pretend that Singapore’s obsession with “upskilling” Singaporean workers doesn’t rely on the exploitation of migrant workers, who are expected to fill all blue collar jobs."
14432,"But implicit in his question was the assumption that these jobs could be outsourced to migrant workers, whom it is ok to exploit."
14433,"Without missing a beat, he said migrant workers would do them."
14434,"I countered that a policy (albeit unwritten, and let’s be real, unrealistic for so many reasons) to move all Singaporeans into white collar work and leave the blue collar jobs with shitty wages and shitty work conditions to migrant workers was unconscionable, to say that these work conditions are not good enough for Singaporeans, but good enough for migrant workers is grotesque and bigoted."
14435,"And he said well, we have to look out for Singaporean workers, as if this is an issue of Singaporean workers vs migrant workers rather than an issue of labour vs capital."
14436,"When we say this country is built on the exploitation of migrant workers, it is a literal statement."
14437,"The exploitation of migrant workers is foundational to how our homes, workplaces, public parks, roads, hospitals, and f&b sectors work (to name only a few)."
14438,"To recognise the poverty and exploitation of migrant workers, not as a separate phenomenon, but as tied to other experiences of deprivation in Singapore, is a form of solidarity too."
14439,"It rejects the narrative that we can resolve poverty in Singapore by moving locals into higher income jobs, it insists that poverty will remain a concern for us until migrant workers’ poverty and exploitation is addressed too, alongside locals’."
14440,Is that racist?
14441,Or does it only become racist if that kid is from a minority race?
14442,When does it become racist?
14443,Is that racist?
14444,"Liberty is in short supply here, especially for the foreign workers who do manual labour."
14445,Liew should serve the amount of jail time or more that the maid served before she got her justice  I have no idea why thats not happening tbh
14446,Like CECA right
14447,"It sucks that a lot of Chinese peeps have this ""ingrained racism"" just can't seem to shake off."
14448,Is that racist?
14449,Is that racist?
14450,Which would deem to be racist?
14451,"So the thoughts of an ex-Malaysia PM is really besides the point since (a) LKY was not making a comment about culture; and (b) the endorsement/agreement by an ex-Malaysia PM does not make a comment less racist, it just means that the ex-Malaysian PM has the same views."
14452,"> “If Singaporeans have not for years been seeing foreigners occupying well-paying jobs while qualified Singaporeans are unemployed or underemployed, we would not be talking about this today.”  CECA and free trade agreements are important to Singapore."
14453,Really action nia... if they really want to do something why not look at the the shamefully low salary these maids are getting?
14454,"It's like how some minorities complain about racism when it comes to job opportunities, it is somewhat the same when it comes to hiring processes but at a ""nationalistic level?"""
14455,"I don't think he was doing anything nefarious or racist (I don't believe he twirled his fingers and said ""I am not hiring any Singaporeans) but end result was that company ended up not really hiring Singaporeans."
14456,Like how you can turn to police for crime case and manpower ministry for work related offenses and police for harassment and racism scenario.
14457,Conceptually speaking ostracization work similarly to racism with the only difference being that one has nothing to do with race but both are to do with giving a special treatment in a bad way to a group or individual which biase treatment being one such example.
14458,"Think about it from another perspective, how is it ever beneficial for the agent to be racist?"
14459,"So by all means, label the homeowner as racist, but don't carelessly label agents as racists too."
14460,"Like it matters to the racists/xenophobes here....when they have already made their mind up that South Asian = bad, no amount of news articles is going to change their views"
14461,"Like it or not, most children speak English as their mother tongue."
14462,Is there a racial undertone for this target against CECA?
14463,Many Singaporeans are racists.
14464,But there are racists.
14465,"Like most discussions about racial discrimination go, just because you are ok with it doesn’t mean it’s not racist."
14466,"Her examples are nothing close to real racism experienced in other countries (and she is based in a country where people have been killed based on skin color) and she decides to write a post about this, effectively kicking up a dust cloud we see here while offering zero suggestion to improve what she perceives as issues."
14467,Like posts on racial equality/anti racism or pro lgbt are usually upvoted.
14468,And while the 2 matters arent exactly linked i would think if one is anti-racism or pro lgbt you wouldn't fervently hate on things that are anti gov even if you dont agree with it.
14469,Like putting all the foreign workers at the back of trucks so they can die an early death.
14470,Your maid isn't a health professional.
14471,"We've been friends more than 20 years, and they have said racist shit, although not directed at me."
14472,"The thing that made me think this could change was when I was out with them, and they saw me experience casual racism first hand."
14473,The most racist thing i've heard in singapore recently is that...you have to be a certain race to be eligible for the elected presidency role now.
14474,That's the most racist and double standard thing i've ever heard.....and i used to work in MINDEF before!
14475,"Like that FB should also be banned in SG since there is a lot of fake news and racist, hateful and xenophobic comments by individuals from Singapore."
14476,Then Whatsapp should also be banned since people can spread their xenophobic ideas and racist thoughts on WhatsApp!
14477,"Like you said the Chinese and Indian expat communities tend to mix around their own as well, unless they're at big MNCs and used to networking."
14478,Sometimes I wonder if western expats understand that going to a bar and having a beer is actually not how most Singaporeans socialize.
14479,"I mean, to the expats it probably sounds like a friendly invitation to a familiar daily activity, but to most Singaporeans drinking is a special-occasion kind of thing, so the idea and activity is actually rather foreign and stressful."
14480,So in this case the price is jacked up so those who can afford to pay more to secure a seat on a VTL flight.
14481,"She could have contacted Prima Deli to clarify first, but nope lets accuse them of being racist on facebook first."
14482,"Likewise, I do appreciate you trying to engage me in good faith, but I hope you can take 3 steps back to re-think what you consider as racism and racial discrimination."
14483,"I'll be the first to admit that my father has some racist thinking like `Malay people are all lazy and poor, because they're so easily satisfied."
14484,The uber xenophobic anti-PAP crowd are not enough to win him enough votes in any SMC or GRC.
14485,"Linking the page - [https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/cleared-dormitories](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/cleared-dormitories)  >As at 20 July 2020, total number of migrant workers who have recovered or have been tested to be free from COVID-19 - 247,000  Cannot recall, but the total number living in these dorms is around 320,000?"
14486,CNA article dated 25 Jun 2020 - [70% to 80% of migrant workers in dormitories expected to be COVID-19 free by end-July](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-migrant-workers-cleared-end-july-12870264)
14487,I struggle to see if this is a pattern limited just to relations between employers and FDWs.
14488,There is nothing special about the foreign workers that work in adtech industry.
14489,Live-in maids are not necessary any more.
14490,"To this day she still refuses to do any cleaning or tidying up because ""I am not a maid"" or ""That's a maids job, i am your wife."""
14491,"""You want a maid, marry one""."
14492,Seriously racism is the least of your concern.
14493,"America has been through worse than a racist, sexist orange as president."
14494,She never has fully asked me if it was OK and truthfully I don't mind all too much from a risk perspective (all young adult expats) but it really is the fact that they seem to have no sense of social responsibility that really grates at me (they were out clubbing etc on the nights prior to CB going into effect).
14495,Lmao I think we still face the same 14-day compulsory hotel travel restriction if we go there.
14496,Lmao it's not called a mother tongue if it's not your own language.
14497,They are now more aware of the entrenched racism and police brutality etc.
14498,"Net gain: 10 less racist young Singaporeans, who may go on to spread their less racist ways to friends/family."
14499,Lmao the other day Louis Ng posted about how migrant workers should be covered from rain when transported and one of the comments was asking him to worry about sheltered walkways for Singaporeans instead.
14500,Lmao these people have no maids.
14501,Your maid keeps her own passport?
14502,"Lovely, nothing like a dash of irony to spice up a communal serving of xenophobia!"
14503,I guess I'm being racist to myself when I call myself a Chinese lolol better watch my mouth from now on!!
14504,Lmao you know some deeply racist people.
14505,"So the problem is clearly systemic  ""Everyone's a little racist."
14506,"Lmao....not that ppl on here care about it, but I'm from a very specific minority and the consensus is that everyone faced quite a bit of bullying/racism in primary school as most went to neighborhood schools, but once ppl got into places like RI/ACS, the racism pretty much went away."
14507,"We were talking about this one day and this dude literally said ""thank god for RI"" implying that was his way out of racism related bullying in earlier school years."
14508,Hundreds if not thousands of such casual racism incident has happened to me and I am sure to most of the minorities.
14509,"As far as campus is concerned(and actually pretty much anywhere else), no worries about racism at all."
14510,"Also, locals are pretty much just focused on their classes/their friends to really have the time to be racist."
14511,"While most stories here are from expats, I wanted to chime in on a recent conversation I had with my part-time cleaner, who is from Myanmar."
14512,"If your friend treats their maid like this, how do you expect they treat their friends behind closed doors?"
14513,"It is a country of so many immigrants, and now it's experiencing a new wave of immigrants - realistically speaking, it's very impressive for the number of different cultures/races/ethnicities all squashed together on our tiny, red dot to still exist in peace and harmony."
14514,The crazy influx of immigrants starting in the 80s has built up a sort of apprehension towards foreigners in general.
14515,"The sudden shock of the more recent influx of immigrants, not just from China and India, has thrust a huge wave of new behaviours and habits upon us."
14516,"If someone shoves you on the bus, it's bad enough, but if that person happens to be an immigrant (and even worse, a rude one who doesn't apologize or see the error in their way) the local dude is going to think ""Goddamn immigrant taking up MY space, shoving me on MY bus."
14517,"It is just a clash of cultures, and I do believe locals feel that immigrants are the ones that need to take that extra step to meet us, since we accepted you into our turf."
14518,"If you consider yourself a nice immigrant, you have people like these to thank for ruining it for all of you."
14519,"Local Indians are also often looked down by these immigrants who bring their caste system with them - that lady asked my mum what caste we were (my family is mostly Tamil, but several generations in Singapore has given us some mixed blood), and then gave a look of disgust when my mum said we don't observe castes here."
14520,This has happened numerous times with Indian expats.
14521,"Hell, I live in Canada now, and I've been asked by Indian immigrants what my caste is."
14522,"But my point is, (and as an immigrant in another country myself), I can guarantee you that if you take the initiative to make the first step, to build that bridge, life will get better."
14523,"If there are douches buying up swaths of property, driving up prices, then that douche is exploiting the system and depriving locals (and honest immigrants) of a decent living."
14524,"And it happens so often, it becomes a trademark of that immigrant group."
14525,"Besides, there is a good number of immigrants (from all over) who are in Singapore JUST to milk it."
14526,"Why don't you write to the paper, or any of the publications geared toward immigrants on how to better integrate?"
14527,"And think of it this way - you probably don't want to live in a place where the landlord is a douchey racist, right?"
14528,"Local indians are our swords to fight off indian nationals that give indians bad reputation, because they won't be seen as racist doing it."
14529,"Locals already have enough problems dealing with mental health, what more foreign workers."
14530,Locals have a staggering sense of entitlement when it comes to maids.
14531,"From some of these quotes, you would have thought that having maids be at your beck and call is an entitlement and not a privilege."
14532,Lol 20 still need a maid?
14533,Lol I don't get the stereotype that expats treat their maids better than locals.
14534,Lol I don't think people actually mind Japanese expats.
14535,Lol I thought expats in SG are trying to run away
14536,Lol all these expats.
14537,At the start of the pandemic the national and worldwide discussion was on racist remarks on the chinese.
14538,"Also you avoided his point, noone was saying minorities cant be racist."
14539,The headline literally calls him racist.
14540,Lol contrast this maid story to the other one to giving them their rights...... 😂
14541,Lol dont try to justify your racism with “the world is racist...etc”.
14542,Just because the world is racist doesnt mean you should continue that racism and be a racist yourself because everyone else is.
14543,"Let's face it, Singapore as a whole (including minorities) is racist af."
14544,"I can file a complaint if I am made to work more than 72 OT hours a month, on top of 12 hours a day - so about 16 hours a day everyday - but maids can't at all because there are no maximum working hours for them) 2) I am legally allowed to rent or own my own living quarters to go home to."
14545,Lol for some reason people here think that racism in SG is minimal and when u compare it to Western countries it's almost 0.
14546,"Tbh I feel the racism here is worse, in western countries when u meet a racist, 99% of the Time they are just a crazy where u can laugh it off."
14547,Lol i guess the benefit of having parents of different races is that you get to make fun of two races and no one can accuse you of being racist?
14548,Lol if this piece of shit is convicted and MOM bans her from hiring FDWs she is gonna have a lot of fun doing chores by herself.
14549,Can pool money open maid shop and train maid to quit after a few days.
14550,"But honestly, maid should be penalized for breaking contract just like any other workplace."
14551,Lol if you liken different races to colors then you are racist.
14552,Lol its absolutely not racist la.
14553,How many cases of foreign worker suicide have we had the past few months?
14554,"Even tho the kids are closer to their maids than their flesh & blood, at least the kids feel they can confide in someone they trust."
14555,Always hear stories about maids know their employer’s kids better than their own kids.
14556,Overwhelming majority of VTL travellers are residents of Singapore
14557,Lol racism is very much alive within the heads of sane Singaporeans.
14558,"Lol reminds me my boss was complaining to me about how he exp racism twice this week First time is when he went for the free checkup and got told only Chinese, malay and Tamil , no European even tho he's citizen 2nd time was yesterday got told to go back to europe by some Chinese dude"
14559,Lol reminds me of a peer in university where his maid will come over during the weekends to clean his dorm room.
14560,The migrant worker complains to her and most likely he'll be sacked and deported
14561,Lol that dude's whole schtick is being a racist mf
14562,Lol that line of a transfer fee makes me imagine a version of fantasy football as employers attempt to sign the best maids.
14563,Lol the helpers maids myst have been so confused when they freshly landed and encountered singapork first world country third world mentality
14564,Lol the maid is not paying shit.
14565,Does not mean that the maid is doing this in *bad faith.
14566,Lol then majority of the world is racist because it is quite normal to not date outside your race.
14567,I really hate it when Indian men online always accuse you of racism when you won't date them.
14568,They racist towards their own?
14569,But I do hate all the racist accusations when a certain race isn't physically attractive to you to date.
14570,Is that racist?
14571,"Lol there are 2 maids where I live that always meet at their spot at the exercisr corner with leash on one hand, phone on the other."
14572,"In other countries, there are stereotypes of older people being racist but in Singapore in some circles it's like legit woke to be casually racists towards some groups of people, usually other Asians."
14573,"There is absolutely no correlation of any sort between 'CECA' in any interpretation and hiring, I never even knew such a thing existed."
14574,"Interesting to see the term or concept being used definitively as an accepted ""truth""  EDIT: it's cute that most of you don't realize how racist the term is."
14575,"He's not saying there is no racism, he's saying the situation is getting worse instead of getting better."
14576,FDW is not MW and what about me EP guy?
14577,Lol why are Singaporeans refusing to see that CECA was a mutually beneficial deal as well.
14578,Those qualified to do the jobs of the Indians that came in because of CECA are employed successfully (mostly tech & middle management).
14579,"Yet, I see so many Singaporeans taking the chance to spout racist shit."
14580,"(even in this comment thread) If you are one of those people, please self-reflect and try to do something about the internalised racism that's leaking...."
14581,Lol why the fuck would expats have an expectation that their host government would want them to be the only priority lol.
14582,"Lol wtf so the expat family ""kept antagonising"" but the one shouting at them wasnt ah"
14583,The same group of idiots calling for maids to be subjected to slave control are the same people crying about being slaves to ns and how their bosses treat them unfairly.
14584,"Honestly any time I hear someone has a maid and doesn’t have some dying, sick or elderly to care for, I think poorly of the person."
14585,Of course this will trigger the horse of lazy adults (guys whose maid pack their field pack) and spilt children here on this subreddit.
14586,"Lol yeah this thread is:  ""We're not xenophobic, except for certain races, which is ok.""  ""We're not xenophobic, except when foreigners behave badly, which is ok.""  ""We're not xenophobic,  except for our old folks, what to do?"""
14587,"""We're not xenophobic, but there's too much immigration..""  ""We're xenophobic, but then so is everywhere else (we imagine) so it's ok."""
14588,"How is ""black people eat fried chicken"" racist?"
14589,You don't get to decide what's racist for another race.
14590,That's FUCKING racist and I'm so shocked I have to teach you this.
14591,&#x200B;  You don't seem to understand how victims of hate/racism tend to accept it when they actually don't like it.
14592,And then it's up to employers to decide whether they want to use for themselves or a give their maids.
14593,"Lol you really just described the survey to be inaccurate just because your own anecdotal experiences say otherwise, because Singapore clearly doesn't have 6 million people and the 100 people you see at Raffles Medical clearly is representative and shows most of the 6 million supports VTL."
14594,Maybe we should address them as *“important hardworking people from other countries usually more impoverished and uneducated who earns much lesser than foreign talent”* /s
14595,"They are greedy, opportunistic, profit driven, unsympathetic and racist!"
14596,"Lol, CECA isn't the problem here though."
14597,"Lol, I think we asians are more racists than our white counterparts hahah."
14598,"Lol, almost everyone in my secondary school is Chinese (IIRC, only like 2 were not chinese, but they were learning chinese anyways), and everyone was casually racist."
14599,"Lol, just start to do mandatory testing for certain areas for their foreign workers."
14600,"Lol, my parents recently hired a new maid (old one worked for 2 years and decided she wanted to go back), the new maid really really loves to talk back to my parents whenever they tell her where she did wrong, she just can’t accept the truth and just likes to 顶嘴."
14601,"At first my mother thought the previous employers might be the problem as they were all older aged employers and she thought the employers might have been the unreasonable and fussy ones, but it turned out to be the maid who had the problems."
14602,There’s this drama about a rich boy and a Vietnamese maid
14603,"The problem lies with you, you seemed to think treating maids as workers means abusing them or something."
14604,Here's our difference:    Me ==> Treat maid like workers professionally with kindness and respect is the norm.
14605,You ==> Treat maid like workers mean abusing them and dehumanizing them.
14606,"Lol, true but whenever I share videos of such kindness from migrant workers, doubters would always say “person in question could be local?”  So hopefully more info of him would suffice so we all can commend and praise him by name!"
14607,If you’re shareholder in local entity you might receive letter inviting you to become citizen few weeks afterwards PR approval.
14608,"Lol,expat family keep antagonizing and provoking."
14609,Who's the one advocating for the damsel in distress in this case (maid)?
14610,Unless you're telling me a domestic helper that steals and gives you attitude problem isnt negative - then I rest my case.
14611,"discriminatory towards foreign worker, paranoid about safety around them."
14612,Classic racist boomer careful around apunehneh stuff.
14613,Much less a family maid that you practically live with.
14614,What's the reason for the breakdown if overall foreign worker population is what matters?
14615,"The MoM has already screwed up so much, you can be sure they won’t tolerate foreign workers who dare voice their opinions."
14616,You don't care about agreements but attack CECA which is an FTA.
14617,Lol... imagine if the misunderstanding continued with the old helper... 'my old sir married his maid'
14618,Lol....alot of chinese singaporeans can't even understand their own mother tongue.
14619,"Lol...do u know even within the gay community in Singapore, there exist so much of racism?"
14620,Lol...you're making it sound as if our govt is PREVENTING expats from being vaccinated - which would be a violation of human rights.
14621,Not asking you solve racism overnight or anything here.
14622,We had a maid.
14623,"The groceries for a large family would be too heavy for a maid and a grandma to carry, and why should the maid pull double duty of shopping and watching out for grandma?"
14624,"Just because you don't shout or hit your maid, doesn't make you a saint."
14625,"In other countries, the low end or ""dirty"" jobs (cleaners, garbage collectors, hard labour, etc) are done by immigrants who are seeking to make a fortune on the exchange rate when they remit back to their home countries."
14626,**Their pay scale is tied to the same pay scale as the foreign workers**.
14627,"Next, on to the other end of the spectrum - expatriates and Singaporeans."
14628,"Unlike those in lower end jobs, expatriates are usually on a Q1, Q2 or E pass."
14629,These are employment passes of which there is no Singaporean to foreigner ratio quota.
14630,"Additionally, for expats, employers don't need to pay their CPF component or levies, plus they have no national service liabilities that can come up in unexpected times like during an important project."
14631,Long time Singapore expat here.
14632,"It's interesting how you decided to ignore the possibility of the many expats spreading the virus because they refuse to wear a mask, instead opting to blame a single persons who is doing his best to limit the said spread while wearing the said mask."
14633,"Look at all you mfs getting your panties in a twist as soon as some angmoh even insinuates a hint of racism, y'all do this shit on the daily to minorities in Singapore and not one bats an eye."
14634,"Now I'm well aware this has nothing to do with this post, but it's frustrating to see the race of the majority complaining about acts of racism when not enough attention is given to how minorities feel when we go through subtle acts of racism (actually maybe even on the same level of her ig post)and is deemed ok.  Downvote me, it's my kink."
14635,Look at the bleeding hearts screaming xeno/racist all over the place in this thread to see how the mere suggestion of such a policy can trigger the SJWs to crawl out of the woodworks.
14636,Look at this thread and you all still claim racism isn't prevalent in Singapore.
14637,What was the plan before COVID for the foreign workers?
14638,"You'd think that between SARS and COVID we would have figured out a solution to house foreign workers during a pandemic, but no."
14639,I have a hard time believing that you are posting this comment just because you are concerned that the foreign workers will lose their jobs.
14640,I can assure you that even with these regulations we would still be hiring foreign workers.
14641,You're just being called an ang moh but you don't get treated worse which is what real victims of racism face in Singapore.
14642,"Look up the [Singapore expat forum](https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewforum.php?f=85&sid=5be86a481572538107195ef2725aa054), they have received lots of anecdotes of successful stories for PR/citizens."
14643,"And their **best guess** is that ICA is looking:  * For people who will seriously sink their roots into SG for the long term (been in SG for more than 3-5 years perhaps) * *Maybe* prefers people of child bearing age to help boost the population * Earns *enough* (no one knows what this value is but not too low) to support themselves and their families * *Maybe* preferred race/nationality (there is a CMIO quota, unfortunately) * *Maybe* working in an industry that the country needs right now  They don't list down the guidelines to prevent people from gaming the system."
14644,"2) The satire approach to discuss the topic >>>> funny, entertaining and acceptable to me 3) racist part / call to harass >>> NOT acceptable."
14645,"Look, I know some people will go to non-VTL countries, post on Instagram and then get surprised pikachu when ICA busts them."
14646,"Latent racism exists, but as a visitor this will be easy to ignore - you're not gonna be working or buying a home."
14647,"Look, like someone else said in this chain, it's the owner's prerogative to rent out their house to whomever they want, but if they're using race or nationality as parameters, they should just own the fact that they are racist/xenophobic."
14648,Do we treat foreign workers well in sg?
14649,I know you think that Australia is a racist country.
14650,"It is a win-win situation for many foreigners, especially expats, I don’t know why you deny it."
14651,Your previous comment basically implied that we Singaporeans look at Japanese expats as people who can do no wrong and that there is functionally no difference between them and people who come in via CECA.
14652,"Now, to address a few things that we are tangentially at odds with:   >One Indian ""expatriate"" (who was actually a naturalised Singaporean married to a born-and-bred Singaporean, but in this post-factual age people like you play fast and loose with facts) made the news for abusing a security guard."
14653,"But that's what you basically did when you decided that the Japanese expats are somehow responsible for the ""a lot of unresolved intergenerational trauma in this part of the world""."
14654,Virtually all the Japanese expats who live here probably born after the war is over (they would have to be 75 and above to be born before the war) and somehow your first comment suggested that we should direct anger at them because they were born in a certain land.
14655,These people aren't happy about anything and the CECA furore is just the latest thing that they're spewing their vile shit about.
14656,"I agree completely that racism exists in Singapore, that to a certain extent such racism is institutionalised, and there exists a segment of people who are outright racists, but broadsiding against other groups of foreigners and asking why they aren't being targetted isn't the way forward."
14657,"Look, I can’t help change your opinion, but if you want to see racism and conspiracies at every corner it’s your prerogative."
14658,Some examples are:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nx7w5q/string\_art\_materials\_in\_singapore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nx7w5q/string_art_materials_in_singapore/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nwo5tz/is\_it\_time\_for\_our\_leaders\_to\_address\_racism\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nwo5tz/is_it_time_for_our_leaders_to_address_racism_in/)  You can make a cursory scroll through:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/?f=flair\_name%3A%22Opinion%20%2F%20Fluff%20Post%22](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/?f=flair_name%3A%22Opinion%20%2F%20Fluff%20Post%22)  And see if you agree.
14659,"Looking at the racist incidents this year, it seems like they're mostly Gen Xs."
14660,"Personally, I don't think it's right to pinpoint a particular demographic because I've also seen Gen Ys and Zs making racist comments or actions."
14661,Looks like Indian vs Indian so I guess it’s xenophobia and not racism.
14662,Not that it’s mutually exclusive but you harping on racism just make your argument weaker to actual racists.
14663,"Casual racism on FB, HardwareZone, Sammyboy has begun to sound like 4chan or 8chan and no one bats an eyelid."
14664,"Pity these foreign workers, they work so hard to built the comforts of what we call home, yet they dont even have a decent place to rest amidst this crisis"
14665,Looks like it’s the expats who are choosing to leave the country due to restrictions of Covid and Singapore is not fun anymore.
14666,"It’s just shows when the “fun” runs out, the expats are the first to leave to find the next fun place."
14667,The issue is the locals newspapers seem to be trying to paint a picture that expats are leaving because of hostility to them which is untrue.
14668,"In fact, she is racist for assuming Japanese/Korean people are all Chinese people"
14669,"Looks like racism is quite prevalent in various public services, not only in MOE."
14670,"Looks like there was a case 4 years ago [where the employer framed the maid for theft, and was sentenced to jail](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/employer-jailed-for-planting-gold-pendant-in-maids-luggage-and-accusing-her)."
14671,Not disputing existence of racism but we have to be clear about the issues.
14672,Looks like this closes the milelion loophole with VTL from Germany needing a pre-departure test but a normal SHN Cat II arrival not needing one.
14673,"Looks like we still have a long way to go when it comes to equality, racism and discrimination 🥲"
14674,"If you can't speak your mother tongue, I am sorry but your linguistic ability falls short."
14675,Lot of expats I know that have left have spent 20 years or more in Singapore.
14676,"It's kinda sad that cheap anti-immigrant fluff is popular   *this is not to say that he wasn't a great man, and for a person born into his position his views were probably progressive, but we have evolved beyond them."
14677,"Yes you can find good niche suppliers here - Jones the Grocer at Dempsey has a great cheese room, and Hubers (also Dempsey) is a good Swiss/German butchery - but you will really pay for the privilege, and most of your fellow customers are very well paid expats so there is little downward pressure on prices."
14678,"You'll recognise many of the products as they are rebranded and resold in the more expensive expat shops, but they're much cheaper here."
14679,Would like to point out that there are many mentally unwell people who are not racist.
14680,Being mentally unwell does not excuse a racist from her behaviour.
14681,"Lots of people are ignoring her racism to talk about her obvious mental illness, but a lot of people are also ignoring her mental illness to talk about her racism."
14682,"Her racism is overt and she's clearly insane, but it doesn't come from nowhere, and a lot of Chinese people unfortunately really do have racist notions like hers (except they're sane enough to not spout it out in a schizo ramble on an MRT)."
14683,"You can't separate the racism and the mental illness, and people need to swallow some hard realities that mental illness isn't just the romanticized internet #depression memes."
14684,"Letting her be is not only failing our Malay community by allowing her to continue harassing them with her racist delusions, but also failing her by allowing her to continue untreated."
14685,Very frustrating to see people dismiss both the very important issues of racism and mental illness to further their own sides instead of evaluating both.
14686,"> confiscate the maids passports   Can this really described as ""indentured servitude""?"
14687,"There is a demand for maids in that families are willing to pay someone to relieve the burden of domestic chores, and there is a supply in that people are willing to do domestic work in return for getting paid."
14688,"You agree that people hiring maids have given these women a choice they did not have before, to earn money and escape the poor conditions they face at home, but somehow this is a bad thing?"
14689,"It is ridiculous to compare the lives of maids to something as inhumane and unacceptable as ""slavery"" but then suggest that minor welfare reforms like giving them one more day off will suddenly make it perfectly acceptable."
14690,Lots of racist cocksucking piece of shits in this section i see
14691,Conclusion: This is racism as one is implying that the entire race as a genetic make-up is lazy.
14692,Conclusion: This is not racism.
14693,This may be insensitive but it is not racism.
14694,Successful deflect from PA to now paint Sarah as an attention grabber and who is using racism wrongly.
14695,I do fear that the xenophobia in Singapore could be a weapon that China could easily use and divide us Singaporean.

14697,Did you sprinkle your cornflakes with a huge amount of xenophobia this morning?
14698,Low skilled foreign workers are paid so low resulting in low skilled low wage local workers having low pay.
14699,"Low wage workers qualifying for work permit makes more sense than low wage workers qualifying for employment passes, no?"

14702,"I've had a similar experience as an NS policeman and in more recent years (because of that experience), a volunteer at one of the two key migrant worker NGOs."
14703,Personally seen both purpose-built dorms and more informal accommodation for migrant workers.
14704,"If you have a problem with domestic helpers accusing you of rape, don’t have sex with them."
14705,MOH pushed the blame to MOM saying dormitory testing is under MOM.
14706,"MOH released statistics for this as a footnote in this [press release](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/504-more-cases-discharged-486-new-cases-of-COVID-19-infection-confirmed):  > In 2018, 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 passed away due to heart disease in Singapore."
14707,"MOM : better treat your maid nicely horrh, if i catch you i post your identity online for taliban to see"
14708,MOM can easily improve the conditions of maids.
14709,"For example, scrap the inflexible 2 year contract system where maids are tied down to their employers."
14710,Likewise with just about any other conceivable policy change that would improve the welfare of maids.
14711,So why would they be concerned with the Filipino maid who doesn't get her day off?
14712,"Can’t find the MOM advisory on it, but anecdotally, a few expats and PRs have also phoned MOM to get more info, and it seems they’re prioritising Singaporean families for transfers since domestic workers haven’t been able to fly in before the lifting of travel restrictions."
14713,"Especially for foreign workers  (whether they are construction workers or domestic workers), their problems are often swept under the carpet."
14714,"I have heard of people around me who treat their maids like slaves, and they wonder why their maids don't stay for long."
14715,"Honestly, all these stipulations make it so excessively difficult for these helpers to meet up with their friends, so the initial poster isn't wrong to criticize how we afford foreign workers zero agency."
14716,Don’t let your lack of imagination shackle you to your racist views.
14717,MOM should investigate the allegation and to take effective action to punish the maid's employer if found to be in the wrong.
14718,That's irrelevant to whether or not a preference is racist.
14719,MOM's website and Facebook expat forums
14720,"MOM:  > facilitate 10 outings since the start of 2021, bringing almost 7,000 migrant workers to the community."
14721,"There are over 600,000 migrant workers in SG who are not FDWs, meaning around 1% have been able to get out of the dorms once."
14722,100 foreign workers.
14723,Maid abuse is not common in Singapore... otherwise there wouldn't be so many people wanting to come here to work as maids .. logic
14724,"Maid agents, pls teach maid not to put their body fluids in food for other's consumption."
14725,Restrained myself from strangling maid.
14726,If you think maid being personal slave is normal something wrong with you and not the society
14727,"Either way, I know that lots of people treat their maids like shit."
14728,Why should employers be responsible for the maid's personal relationships and actions outside of work.
14729,This is what's driving passport-keeping behaviour and employers to have an unhealthy control over the personal lives of maids.
14730,"Unsurprisingly enough, the shift towards 'helper' could be because of the need of some employers to distance/differentiate themselves from others who call their maids 'maids' and treat them like shit."
14731,"Get degree in Manila, make a lot more here than the maids do."
14732,"If maids accept the current salary (and not go to other countries to work instead), and MoM does not raise the levy - the current salary of the maids is the market price."
14733,"Any maid can change employment the day the wish, with no financial consequences."
14734,"Now, when it comes to the financial well-being of the maid suddenly the employers are so concerned as to provide free banking services for the maid?"
14735,I have seen Singapore maid owners vs Malaysia maid owners.
14736,"I wouldn't dare raise a kid if I'm not the one imparting life lessons and instead hire a maid to do that, maybe even worse, expecting teachers to perform that function."
14737,And its a two way street with bosses getting some pretty tough maids.
14738,Finding the right maid and have a great relationship is one that both parties will need to maintain and nurture.
14739,"A maid isn't your budget solution to care for elderly, sickly or the needy where they're on call 24 hours a day."
14740,"There are common abuses where a maid is usually forced to take care of infants, kids, unwell elders, cleaning home, cooking, ironing ALL AT THE SAME TIME."
14741,Maids without bf can hangout and engage in activities with fellow maids and volunteers.
14742,"Imagine having SAP Malay/Indian schools too, that'll be the day we transcend systemic racism."
14743,Majority of my friends are either local or Taiwanese - I have a huge group of expats contacts due to some of the activities I do (and also due to my work) but on average only 5-6 people in that group are friends of mine.
14744,"Plus I also live in a very local area and a very local estate (where I live I am usually the only white person in the area) so I am quite ""away"" from the expat bubble a lot of foreigners build :)"
14745,"In times of prolonged covid travel restrictions, they will gtfo."
14746,"In the other thread about expats missing their families and important moments in their lives (I truly empathise), it was implied by the top commenter that the mass exodus of foreigners will lead to serious issues in Singapore economy."
14747,I got down voted to hell but anyway - It is too presumptuous of expats to think they are indispensable.
14748,Note: I'm referring to expats and not foreigners in essential services here.
14749,"Usually, expats tend to group together and it becomes intimidating to interact."
14750,The group thing also kind of (just my two cents others feel free to correct me) makes expats look really haughty and exclusive.
14751,Make babies with foreign workers
14752,Make mother tongue elective.
14753,"Make sure all the names (first, middle, maiden, whatever) in your SMART health card is reflected in your passport as well."
14754,And maybe have those coys who employed errant migrant workers who flouted rules or came over with covid to pay a price as well.
14755,Make those planning to hire maids work for a day to understand how maids work so they will be less likely to abuse since they know how tough the work is and the pay they get.
14756,"Makes me wonder why that time the maid threaten to report to MOM, why didn’t liew mun leong just pay her a sum of money to solve the problem lol"
14757,"And mind you, I’m not even going down the route of alleged xenophobia but pure economics."
14758,Seems pretty racist to me :p Also no lbgqt on their stuff??
14759,"If you want to insist that calling out Islam is being racist, you either need English lessons or are just too stubborn to accept FACTS."
14760,"I will never support racism, never said I have, but offering critique on religion is quite acceptable."
14761,"That isnt racist, but someone else commented  ""Oh, theyre oppressed just like the blacks in the US."""
14762,Now sure that doesnt show outright racism but I feel that there is a blatant racial ignorance.
14763,"Quite a number of people feel its enough that all races gets equal rights, and that their version of not being racist is just not calling racial slurs."
14764,Its not that people are racist.
14765,Are you saying Malays are racist towards themselves?
14766,Does that make you a racist?
14767,"Malaysia also opening April 1, so no VTL flights in either direction as I understand it."
14768,Malaysia maids are really part of the family.
14769,"Malaysian Chinese also study in their Chinese school, so they almost grow up as 华侨 (rather than simply being 华人Malaysian, or like Sg chinese who only have mother tongue course as their formal Mandarin education)"
14770,It’s always funny when these posts come up about someone saying something racist.
14771,Then a commenter will then mention Malaysia and how it’s worse there and everyone just gets distracted with all agreeing “yes Malaysia is worse”   Racism is racism in all forms shapes and intentions.
14772,"Man I am very sorry you're feeling this way, I want to believe these xenophobic and outright racist stuffs happening online are by a small group of misguided hate filled minority and the overwhelming majority have no issue with ceca nor any other free trade agreement and we understand they are benefitual to Singapore."
14773,"Man I really feel sorry for you that you go about your day to day life having to look at a person who is white and then immediately assume, based on your own racist agenda, that he or she likely looks down on you or thinks they are better than you, without even getting to know the person."
14774,All you proved is your racist mentality by making such a statement as “most white people” and following it up with a negative blanketed understanding or view of those people.
14775,"My parents are PRC immigrants, and while the comments against PRCs aren't as extreme in the past few years as those against Indian immigrants, some of the online xenophobic comments (like PRC immigrants all shit in the street) really get to me a little bit."
14776,"I don't know if this will help, but what I turn to sometimes for comfort is the knowledge that our own history has proven the zero-sum narrative of immigrants ""stealing"" from locals wrong again and again - the history of this country is written with the blood, sweat and tears of successive generations of immigrants all contributing to the vibrancy of our culture and economy, even as they face discrimination from previous generations of immigrants (e.g., many Straits Chinese initially viewed newer immigrant labourers from Southern China that came in the 30s and 40s with disdain)."
14777,"You and I too are part of this grand narrative, and chances are, like me, you and your children will fully integrate into Singaporean society (usually so well that eventually people will start making xenophobic comments in front of you, expecting you to join in, without realising your own family background)."
14778,"Because first gen immigrations like our parents focus more on survival and bread and butter issues, I feel that the onus is really on us second generation immigrants, who are more likely to be integrated and therefore have a louder voice, to push back against the kind of truth-free xenophobic hysteria that has taken over some corners of our society."
14779,"You can participate on online forums, you can try to gently push back when friends make casual xenophobic jokes, and, after you get your citizenship, you can vote against parties that push these toxic xenophobic narratives (like NSP, PSP to some extent and previously Singaporeans First) and convince others to do the same."
14780,I find that doing my little bit helps to reduce the feeling of helplessness against this seemingly overwhelming tide of hatred directed towards immigrants.
14781,"Man jailed 5 weeks for making racist remarks at cashier, choking a nurse, having body odour"
14782,They already suffer from border closure.
14783,Man that is fked up how they dont even let their maid eat a full meal.
14784,You probably did not become racist while living here you were just racist all along.
14785,I feel completely alone in arguing with these racists that make “private property” arguments or even worse just say racism against Indians wasn’t explicit here.
14786,It’s so tiring getting downvoted but these racism deflectors.
14787,They refuse to admit it is racist or that it’s not okay.
14788,The subtle racism is often worse than active-aggressive racism.
14789,"During class presentation plays, they always cast me as the maid since they knew that my mum was part filipino."
14790,"Man, local indians already have trouble renting, let alone expats."
14791,"Man: some maid video my friend, i avenger"
14792,Management thinks that expats bring in more overseas experience that is uncommon in Singapore.
14793,"EDIT: My claim that local faculty members in Singapore universities don't get housing benefits like their foreign colleagues has been called [""absolute horse-shit""](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4rhw3r/do_expats_really_get_paid_more_than_locals_for/d51lfsh) by a [know-it-all](https://www.reddit.com/user/Speedz007)."
14794,"For examples search for ""expat package."""
14795,Many Singaporeans grew up hearing or making racist jokes against Indians from childhood.
14796,"*Obligatory disclaimer*: This is all wildly extrapolative and inaccurate, uses a poorly controlled sample, relies on the whims of random Internet posters, and doesn’t account for how unlinked, dormitory or imported cases may impact the delays."
14797,"Many Singaporeans simply want more reasonable restrictions to foreign immigrants, but there's a fair amount of people who make very general statements that can be interpreted as something extreme."
14798,"When people say that they don't want foreign talent, they don't usually mean that they literally want to completely stop the flow of foreign workers into Singapore."
14799,"Short-sighted individuals who want to completely ban foreigners like to pretend that everyone wants the same thing as them, while overly liberal hippies like to paint everyone else as stubborn xenophobic conservatives."
14800,I see xenophobic comments often both online and in real life.
14801,Many expats are leaving however this is not really being reflected in pricing yet.
14802,Many expats play cricket in the field next to Northumberland Road in the weekends.
14803,"My personal experience with friends who are recent immigrants, either they 1. take a nuanced view of things (SG is an independent country), or 2. they are deep into the CCP koolaid."
14804,My specific reason for the trip was because I knew that  I won't be able to see her for months after that due to her work commitments in Batam and the looming travel restrictions that were to be put in place.
14805,Many high SES Indians call themselves expats too mah.
14806,"I don't like the word immigrant as for me, it means that person has migrated here and became Singaporean."
14807,"Many of my expat collegues choose to leave SG and give birth in their home country, specially the indian."
14808,Many of my expat friends left.
14809,"Usually, the managers and the directors will receive expat packages, so the wage budget is now further squeezed as the peons are now being paid higher."
14810,Its a perfect example of both racism and classism.
14811,Many people are enquiring about VTL but I wonder how many are really going.
14812,What happens is the agency contacts the maids employer and tell them that they cannot mistreat the maid.
14813,Then the employer says “yes of course” and then instead of fixing their behaviour they stop letting the maid leave the apartment because they know she spoke to someone about it.
14814,"Many years ago, I read or heard someone talk about how we should not need to identify someone by their race because that in itself is a form of racism."
14815,Massive amounts of racism from the far-left SJW type.
14816,"When they find out I disagree with their politics, I invariably get called a race-traitor with internalised racism."
14817,TBH I get more casually racist jokes in SG than UK (and in turn I crack racist jokes less because people seem more serious about racism here).
14818,Nowhere in her diatribe did she say she want to date someone who is a non-expat.
14819,Mate you must be fucking blind or just don't know how to read the god damn title  Anyone can be racist.
14820,> Offer any expat who got kicked out the option to stay here for $300.
14821,If expats don't want their privilege of working in sg to be jeopardized then consider not offending the host country by breaking its laws?
14822,What I can’t understand is why this is turning into an expat v foreigner debate.
14823,"Mate, the Poms are so racist they ostracise even those with the same tone of melanin."
14824,"In terms of supporting academia, trying to influence public policy, contributing to legislative efforts, private-public partnerships (effort for migrant workers) pleading clemency and securing legal representation (for death penalty cases), increasing awareness, education, public relations, they've done it all."
14825,"It's not like the issues that migrant workers are facing today are new, they've been raised by activist for over 20 years now the inadequate and exploitative accommodation just being one of them."
14826,"They also do the real leg work, I recall years ago foreign domestic workers and migrant labourers communication over Facebook and other channels when they were literally kidnapped and confined in small rooms with their phones taken away, had their work permits cancelled, not paid their wages and ""escorted"" to the airport to be sent home especially when they had ongoing claims with their employers."

and potentially the only overweight saving grace in STI for the last 10+ years."
14830,"Even the DBS peers like UOB lead by ""homegrown true blue"" Singaporeans have been outperformed by over 150% by ""a CECA""."
14831,I think the word “expat” is way too early to use for 25yo )
14832,I don't really hang with expat crowds in the first place.
14833,Let the expats leave and SG begin a painful restructuring that may do good in the long run.
14834,Maybe Singapore should stop allowing live-in maids.
14835,Just let domestic helpers work on a system where they get paid on an hourly basis and they get to go back to their dorms/flats at the end of the day.
14836,I mean if I judge majority Singaporeans as racist then seeing all the incels on line.
14837,"Maybe banning foreign live in maids we will have some pushback on shitty work culture and finally get some work life balance, since your boss also doesn’t have a maid."
14838,"Maybe because she admitted that her ministry, which she is in charge of, failed to properly enforce high dormitory standards in order to placate the profits of Contractors and dorm owners."
14839,"Maybe cuz many Singaporean are quick to condemn racism overseas, even things like supporting western movements like BLM while in Singapore, so it's expected that they are not racist themselves, yet ironically some of those same people are"
14840,"Maybe employers should be allowed to keep, say, 20% of the maid's salary to help them save."
14841,The money should be kept until the maid leaves Singapore or retires.
14842,Cultural imperialism is really just a sanitised version of racism.
14843,No wonder for others who are not PRs and especially for the ones who look different coming from the other countries get all the racist remarks and hate.
14844,"Maybe he has Singaporeans' interests at heart, maybe he just doesn't like CECA."
14845,The other area in which he went against the party line was when he [voiced concern about government being too pro-importing foreign talent.
14846,"](http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90329ip.htm) As someone whose parents are immigrants and who abhor the kind of nativist rhetoric championed by trump, I can't in good conscience support this."
14847,Maybe if you're surrounding yourself with China-immigrants.
14848,"Surrounding yourself with foreign China immigrants and having that as your entire world bubble isn't representative of Singapore as a whole, that's just a problem on your end."
14849,Maybe instead of referring to them as foreign worker you can see they are a human first 🤔
14850,"Maybe it was more of a business decision, i.e this maid won't give me repeat business but this guy in a suit will."
14851,"In this case the maid really wanted to get to her boyfriend, so I guess she wanted to keep her focus on this goal?"
14852,"Maybe it's better to think of it (and much of this is from Ibram X. Kendi's ""How to be an Anti-Racist) as ""racist actions."""
14853,"He says, ""While making racism bad seems like a positive change, we have to look at how this functions in practice."
14854,"Within this paradigm, to suggest that I am racist is to deliver a deep moral blow – a kind of character flaw assassination."
14855,"It's often unhelpful to label someone as a ""racist""-- because that word immediately makes us feel attacked especially if our action may have occurred out of ignorance or had an unintended effect."
14856,"Kendi talks about ""racist actions"" instead...because behaviours can be changed."
14857,"""The good news is that racist and antiracist are not fixed identities."
14858,We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next.
14859,"In your example, one might unintentionally say/do something racist because they do not understand another's culture-- but it is our willingness to learn and grow and change that decides what kind of person we are."
14860,"It is descriptive, and the only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it—and then dismantle it."
14861,Maybe its because the caucasians we see around in Singapore are normally of above average income and are usually expats.
14862,Calling it racism is a stretch but its just ignorance.
14863,"*Live-out maids, who enjoy the privacy such arrangements bring, can be paid as much as $1,500 a month, which covers their rental, transport and food expenses."
14864,This is double what some maids here get every month.
14865,"Maybe not racist but sexist, or both?"
14866,"We absolutely have fought against racism, the brown face incident for example but the amount of Singaporeans tweeting/posting stories about it seems much smaller than this."
14867,Maybe ppl who want to employ domestic helpers need to undergo mental fitness test (and pass) before they are allowed to do so.
14868,"Maybe should lock up Chinese uncles instead since they seem to be the one spreading covid, not foreign workers."
14869,"Maybe some ""SJWs"" are virtue signalling when it comes to racism against minorities but racism should be something we need to address anyway."
14870,"But you're assuming these ""sinkies"", ah lian, ah beng, xiao mei meis are all ignorant/racist and don't actually give a shit about what's been happening in the States based on snippets of their social media accounts."
14871,"They also might be doing their bit against local racism here, just in private because not everything has to be documented online."
14872,"That said, yeah, if you go on BLM, then make sure you're actively doing your bit to combat local racism/xenophobia too."
14873,Make it more expensive for them to stick with the current status quo vs adopting safer means of transporting these foreign workers about.
14874,"Maybe the PMET white collar circle I mix around in is different, but easily 50% of people both local or expats in SG that I know of through work or social life have flown abroad to Europe the moment VTLs were opened."
14875,"It IS a critical piece on migrant worker conditions in Singapore, albeit against the backdrop of covid 19."
14876,Maybe the recruits get that figure (I doubt it's that little) but Gurkhas definitely have a cushy life compared to Bangladeshi workers or maids.
14877,Not saying that is a good way of doing business but sometimes it isn't racism but just plain favoritism.
14878,Maybe there should be some sort of background check on employers before they can hire maid.
14879,Maybe they can fine employers for for not returning migrant workers in working order too.
14880,"Is local food just ""meh"" or do expats really miss the food?"
14881,"Maybe she feels like whether you call her maid or helper, her job is still the same"
14882,Maybe wages of maids would have risen much higher if not for the actions of the government.
14883,"Wages of maids are not ""price""."
14884,Maybe we should raise the tax by 10% so all these maids can get another day off...
14885,If you can relate then it is the same concept which for bias treatment it follow racist scenario as it is a bias treatment towards the races which also used to be ignored ay first until rioting happens so I don't think we need to wait for rioting to happen for this whether small or big group.
14886,"If you are Chinese or Asian, you can sense the racism when you go to US or Europe."
14887,"And the level of xenophobia here frankly is very Low, and it is mainly driven by frustration by some locals when they are forced out of their jobs to do food delivery etc."
14888,It is a different viewpoint about population policy but pls do not call this xenophobic.
14889,Pls do not conflate discussion of immigration policies with xenophobia.
14890,Maybe you only see incels and racists online because they are too scared to voice their opinions in real life.
14891,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/racial-preferences-cross-the-line-into-racism-when-overt-and-imposed-on-others
14892,"If they think you're good enough to do this work for them and that justifies employing a foreign worker, then they should pay you roughly that much too"
14893,"There's plenty of unnecessarily hard/morally questionable/underpaid work here if that's your thing :)  There are a few racist people though, but they direct their hatred towards muslims and eastern europeans."
14894,Me against my brother   Me and my brother against my cousin   Me and my cousin against the world  &#x200B;  What we need is more xenophobia to bring different races together.
14895,It's not useful if it's one way VTL to Johor.
14896,"In each location, definitely including here, I lived as a local, receiving no ""expat package"" nor a salary higher than what would be paid to a local doing the same work."
14897,"Singapore is the *only* country I have lived in or visited where racism is so blatantly, preeningly, a foundational principle of society combined with the majoritarians' refusal to take an honest, non-Government-filtered look at the situation."
14898,Meaningless smug platitude because everyone everywhere is a descendent of an immigrant.
14899,Meanwhile my friend’s maids are being treated like queens and brought out to a fully paid holidays with them.
14900,"Tbh i think maids are mostly treated as family, its just a small minority of people who abuses their maids."
14901,"Meanwhile we classify covid as dormitory workers, sc/pr, wp."
14902,"Meanwhile when CECA boss hires compatriots: Discrimination, unfair, cronyism"
14903,"Meanwhile, 'expats' are complaining that SG has become 'unwelcoming' to them"
14904,"Meanwhile, Malaysia is gonna be using the booster requirement to minimise quarantine days for non-VTL travellers."
14905,"We still get the good stuff, no more racism when hiring, now we just focus on the ability of the person themselves."
14906,"Meh, his point, which could be better put, is less that it's not racist, and more that it's classist rather than racist."
14907,"What many people seem to forget is that while Bangladeshis make up the bulk of our foreign workers, we actually have a good number of PRC foreign workers (talking about those in construction and cleaning, since that's the same classification for the Bangladeshis."
14908,Classism is not mutually exclusive with racism.
14909,There are some truly racist people.
14910,"But not all classist people are racist people, and not all racist people are classist."
14911,Not an arguement for or against a language test.
14912,"[https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/legal-and-dispute-support/unlawful-discrimination](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/legal-and-dispute-support/unlawful-discrimination)  And rofl at ""solve racism""."
14913,"It lessens the harms related to racism, that's all."
14914,It goes a long way WHILE we make systemic changes to solve racism.
14915,My generation was the xinyao era but I steadfastly refused anything to do with mandarin pop culture because I hated that it was forced on me as a mother tongue.
14916,My mother tongue is Cantonese dammit.
14917,"Mental illness and racism are not mutually exclusive, it seems that she may have both."
14918,I wonder why the Singapore youths are so insistent that other countries got racism correct.
14919,I finally got the that they have serious racism issues at the scale we have never seen.
14920,Merriam Webster definition of the word Racism:  1: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race  also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice  Let's not go to extremes into calling ignorance/incompetence as racism.
14921,Is this racism?
14922,"When you pervert the word 'racism' to cover everything under the sun, it loses it's true meaning and it gets harder to differentiate and fix the real problems in our society."
14923,"Mfers here say they hate racism but then turn around and regurgitate far-right wing talking points, as this meme demonstrates."
14924,"Middle-aged old fart, male expat, east coast."
14925,Might I also add that the issue of immigrant Chinese economic prosperity and native majority deprivation is prevalent throughout SEA.
14926,"VTL means no need to quarantine in that other country too, but in countries like Japan, the quarantine still exists for vaccinated travelers."
14927,In any case FDW is somewhat different from a regular employee because of the intimate nature of the job.
14928,Might be better to just expand land VTL to a point where it can satisfy all land demand first.
14929,What is a good annual wage level I should aim for as an expat with a dependant spouse (no kids)?
14930,Migrant low skilled workers are not expats.
14931,"There are significant difference that are up for legitimate conversation, you started by stating it is racists, now it has moved to bigoted."
14932,Migrant workers don't have the bandwidth to make complaints like the expats.
14933,Plus expats whining makes better headlines.
14934,"In secondary school and poly, people were constantly making jokes about me being a Filipino maid."
14935,"Also, had some people telling me I'm the first Filipino they've met who's not a maid??????"
14936,You cannot compare that to foreign workers being transported on a highway for cost saving measures.
14937,"I voted for the opposition not because of left leaning views (i.e racism, gender wage gap etc) but more of bread and butter issues and most importantly the stability of PAP's policies."
14938,Min Shan is explicitly talking about racism here.
14939,"For someone in the G to acknowledge that we have more to do to address racism is considered news because the G has, for the longest time, deflected the issue to fit the narrative that we have racial harmony and it is hard won."
14940,"But it gives voice to, and legitimises what a lot of minorities have been feeling about this issue when they've met so much opposition from the mainstream narrative that there is no racism."
14941,This is explicitly about racism.
14942,"Example I have would be in France, we had to put laws so that companies not only don’t underbid minimum wages by bringing foreign workers on foreign contract, but also that they can’t put out a sub contracting scheme leading to the same thing."
14943,Mind sound abit xenophobic but usually the foreigners' lives is work then sleep then back to work with very little recreational activities.
14944,"I don’t think it is the presence of domestic helpers, but rather their attitude that it is not their responsibility."
14945,"Mine was pretty different, came back from Turkey a few weeks ago (non VTL)."
14946,That’s racism.
14947,"If you disagree, you’re racist"
14948,"Minorities cannot get in, because they would need to study Chinese there, which most of them obviously don't want to since it's not their mother tongue."
14949,Minorities receiving racist remarks is only plausibly “opinion” to a majoritarian chauvinist.
14950,"Minority here (who complains often about racism, etc.)"
14951,"The reflex is to fine/jail instead of addressing:  - institutional racism,  - hyper consciousness and obsession about race eg how every conversation inevitably has a ""what race?"""
14952,Minority: Lets talk about racism...
14953,A restaurant or service rejecting a customer because of race - that's racist.
14954,The parents should just take the kid along via non VTL route or go protest to her MP for not including kids in VTL travel or just stay in Singapore for holidays

14957,My Indian father took Malay in school even though he spoke Tamil as his mother tongue at home.
14958,"Sometimes the reason I hear companies hire foreign is not because of the money even, its because when high amount of training is involved, the industrial discipline Singapore Gov artificially imposes onto the foreign workers makes their retention rate quite high even when management is a shit show."
14959,"However, having known hundreds of people with domestic helpers, and even for my own case, I think there are a lot of other factors that develop empathy."
14960,The maids have a better setup here with a sheltered enclosed porch with a bed and an extended garden.
14961,You don't need to furnish your residential address to get the employment pass approved.
14962,I have a relative who treats her maid like this and me and my wife openly critic her but she doesnt seem to care.
14963,"Moe moe kyun <3  BTW, maid cafes won't call u okyuku."
14964,"Mom: wow malays are pigs and indians are stinky  Me: dont say that,, its racist  Mom: you not racist then u marry them la!"
14965,"So there might be people who will move here temporarily for the title, the experience, and despite not struggling to live, they also won't save those moneys that Singaporeans think expat earns."
14966,"Well, guess what, that's how the World is, and actually if you happen to be an expat, even with 10K, there is no BTO, no HDB."
14967,>the fear of the maid leaving with stolen things before the contract end also cant she steal after the contract ends too?
14968,"like i understand a maid could have bad intentions to just come, steal and leave but the maid should be blacklisted and have legal ramifications when they go back to their country."
14969,An FDW whilenin your employ has Intimate access to your valuables and family members.
14970,do u know the notice period for a maid to quit?
14971,"but these are the risks employers face   A maid can leaver her contract AT ANY TIME with no repurcussions, no questions asked."
14972,"The employer is out about $3k every time an FDW wishes to cjange employer, even if it is no failt of their own, unless within the giarantee period of 3-6 mths."
14973,Only about 60% of FDWs complete their contracts.
14974,What are you going to do if your FDW sits in the house and refuses to work?
14975,">maid should be treated just like how u would treat a singaporean worker in a company here , or a foreign worker in a company here."
14976,This does not mean we should not turn a blind eye on how these rules can and ARE abused by many FDWs.
14977,There are whole FB groups teaching FDWs how to abuse the system.
14978,Come back when you've actually hired and had to manage your FDW.
14979,"From my POV, she said that LTA would be investigating, but the main issue is she still justified the use of transporting workers via lorries, i.e."
14980,"Morally there's nothing wrong with foreign workers having sex with foreign domestic workers  Legally though, it does run afoul of some employment regulations  Edit : Sorry  I should clarify, they will have to leave if they get pregnant"
14981,More VTLs please
14982,"More and more news are surfacing of foreign workers in bad states of mental health/in distress, and there doesn't seem like anything has been done about it."
14983,More cringe than racist
14984,Especially since maid getting pregnant = liability on employer.
14985,More like when SGians have become accustomed to treating maids like objects or property.
14986,"We need to set a minimum wage for domestic workers, implement proper checks on living conditions, give them 2 days off every week, set a boundary for working hours, set a fixed amount of vacation time for them to visit family and last but not least force every employer to sit through courses and tests on how to treat domestic workers properly."
14987,"More like, what can you do about racist beliefs?"
14988,"The best any society can do is to ensure that despite the fact that there are these pathetic creatures called humans like you and me exist, is to embrace and acknowledge the fact that we are all racist by nature in some way or form, and that we should never let it translate into actions that will cause destructive consequences."
14989,Denial of racism or adhering to political correctness will be the doom of us all.
14990,The open racism in the workplace is much worse here.
14991,"More security theater:  Despite having a booster takeup rate of 88%, migrant workers in dorms are still on lockdown."
14992,Many kids think it's ok to crack racist jokes because they don't get reprimanded.
14993,Notice how such posts are less active compared to if the one being racist was Chinese?
14994,Singapore has strict laws to prevent blatant racism and xenophobia like this.
14995,More that it's not racist to make a joke about how a language sounds.
14996,"While there's nothing wrong with it but in the long run they only interact within a specific social circle then racism, biases and stereotype can form."
14997,More xenophobia than racism actually (based on the comments) although the xenophobia does hide the racism
14998,"Most Liberal parties in almost every country is ""anti-immigrant"" if you look it from an angle  Labor under Miliband had a tougher immigration policy manifesto than the Tories."
14999,"The Democrats in USA are much smarter - knowing that they have to appeal to a liberal base, what they do is advocate punishment for employers who ""abuse"" immigrants - i.e."
15000,"Rather than saying anti-immigrant, rather think pro-worker."
15001,"And no, there is no hidden racist agenda."
15002,"Right now at this moment I bet there's Laotian, Thai or Chinese people complaining about some useless SG expat being paid a fortune."
15003,Most VTL flights are full or filling up.
15004,Its not just US VTL.
15005,"It is a conscientious result of ""VTL"" with limited flight quotas."
15006,Alternatively don't take VTL and serve 7 day SHN.
15007,"Most are racist for the sake of doing so, especially for the merdeka gen."
15008,Violent crime like maid abuse?
15009,"Most countries, especially ones where majority of expats in Singapore come from, have cuisines that have multicultural influences."
15010,"Most do because if the maid is to run off, the employer will have to forfeit the $5000 bonds or at least half of it."
15011,The employer is also required to make effort to locate the maid at his own cost.
15012,The excuse that it is to prevent abuse of foreign worker is not even valid.
15013,There may be some older folk and foreign workers who speak their native language.
15014,This and the above factor affects how you compare the levels of racism in both places.
15015,"often times the issue is whether the incident you encountered is an en example of racism or not, because the same incident viewed by different persons will yield different conclusions."
15016,The kind of 'go back to your own country' or '<racial expletive>' type racism is the least of your concerns.
15017,"Most importantly, MAKE SURE IT IS A VTL FLIGHT."
15018,In industry - every foreign talent brings with him more jobs.
15019,"Super difficult to find a unit for rent here, usually only expat owners allow Indians here."
15020,Most like a fine/ probation only .. if this woman can afford to have 3 maids confirm can get the best lawyer in town..
15021,"Most likely these maids are not allowed to take a day off, talk to others or have a mobile phone so they can't ask for help."
15022,Most maid agency are pretty scummy.
15023,Most maids have their expenses completely covered by the employer.
15024,"Most maids will congregate, while u trust yourself to try to do the right, will u trust them enough as well?"
15025,Most middle class hire maid is for taking care their senior.
15026,Those who are really rich who hire maid who need 24/7 service for their random house work
15027,"Most migrant workers aren’t aware exactly what’s stipulated by the govt, and if the dorm operators tell them “this is the new law from the govt, you cannot go out anymore, we will supply you food but you need to pay”, they are more likely to just surrender their money/ATM cards than to question, because the main thing that all of them want to avoid is any situation of them getting sent back home (more on this below after the jump)."
15028,I heard from my father that scenes of migrant workers at the airport crying and begging not to be sent back are so common that no one bats an eyelid (source: he used to drive a MaxiCab so camping at the airport waiting for calls were a daily affair).
15029,Look at how my thread got deleted when I tried to bring light to racism again Chinese and how I got muted + perma banned.
15030,https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o7kd7l/woke_rsgs_lack_of_interest_against_racism_towards/
15031,Most of my expat friends in Singapore have already left.
15032,The environment in Singapore is no longer receptive to expats.
15033,It’s ironic given that expats are the whole reason Singapore is successful in the first place.
15034,And now they are even more vocal about their opinions and xenophobia due to the spread of the virus
15035,"Labelling all of them as ""Malay"" is ignorant and racist."
15036,Most of the countries us expats from are like that.
15037,Most of the developed world survives without maids.
15038,Most of the frustration is not coming from foreign workers but from employment/s pass.
15039,"Most of the maids stay at home for almost whole day and this is only one day they get to go outside while rest of the people travel to work in crowded metros, queue for food during lunch and work with lots of people in office."
15040,Most of them will vote for Opposition party in a heart beat lol  Yup some opposition supporters can be racist AF
15041,"For us the only difference between a Chinese Indonesian and a non-Chinese Indonesian is the Chinese Indonesian is probably rich  &#x200B;  As for the CMIO thing, the main reason for that is due to govt policy."
15042,Most people I know who have FDW treat them like actual humans and not like what you describe.
15043,Most people are definitely born racist.
15044,"Most people are gonna say this is largely confined to the older generations, but IMO, the younger generations are as or even more xenophobic as they are the ones having to compete academically and in the workplace with foreigners."
15045,"While most will say yes we need to pay migrant workers/construction workers more and hopefully attract more locals to join the construction industry, when prices of houses/renovation increase or things are delayed because of the lack of workers, they will kbkp until kingdom comes"
15046,Most people probably aren't as racist as these guys but most people are happy to ignore and do nothing.
15047,Apathy to this degree of racism is a problem.
15048,Most people who haven’t lived elsewhere besides sg would never understand what it feels like being a minority and experiencing racism.
15049,"Being Asian in western countries can be tormenting, especially if the neighbourhood you live in is filled with racists like this dude."
15050,How can a domestic helper easily find her own employment?
15051,Most racist race in SG istg.
15052,Most racist thing I've learned is probably   Why are Indians called keling kia in Hokkien language - in the past some Indians were slaves and the chains that were bound to them clashes as they walk.
15053,"Creating the 'kling kling' sound of clashing metals, after time the old Chinese folks begun to call them keling kias from the sound produced by the chains   Man I have no idea if this is true or just some made up shit but it's the most racist statement or story I know."
15054,Most racists portray their racism by proxy via xenophobia towards India Indians.
15055,Most read the headline and assume the employer took advantage of the maid.
15056,The maid who was back in the Philippines was told she was no longer needed but asked to come back and worked illegally for another employer.
15057,"To date, Theresa has not made any restitution to Montefolka, but the prosecution said it was not seeking compensation as the maid faced charges over illegal employment."
15058,">Charge sheets showed Montefolka was allegedly hired as a maid by another employer, Noraliza Kamardin, without a valid working pass, between August 2018 and April 2019."
15059,Let's not make all issues just be about race and racism.
15060,Are there racist in the society?
15061,"But do we want to live in a society where as long as the racial composition in a system is not similar to national average, it must be ""about race and racism"" and the system must be dismantled."
15062,"I get that this article refers to FDW specifically, but I find there to be a glaring lack of representation of our other foreign workers, which is why I'm bringing this up here."
15063,Mostly older expats.
15064,"Mr Abdul Halim said that his Facebook post, which was written in Malay, was not intended to be racist."
15065,"Don't know what i would have done If i have not fallen into the rabbit hole watching a gaming maid onion, war criminal rabbit and tomboy duck, but im glad i did."
15066,Much of everything you said is about how treating domestic helpers as second class humans is rightfully acceptable due to their role.
15067,"Btw, don’t call them maid."
15068,"But with the overwhelming influx of CECAs, everything changed."
15069,"My ""mother tongue"" isn't one of the official ones so I just anyhow do Malay lor."
15070,Nowadays at least I think they teach Mother Tongue without assuming it necessarily is a Mother Tongue- the problem back in the 80s and 90s was the assumption of prior fluency (teaching a mother tongue involves very different pedagogy from teaching a second language).
15071,It sounds to me like your FDW might be burned out.
15072,"I think that FDW’s salary should be considered  as such, a salary."
15073,My French and Indian expats seem to be quite comfortable staying put here
15074,My MNC has cut down significantly on expat positions precisely because of this.
15075,"My accidentally-a-racist story:  More than 10 years back, I met this black guy on the shinkansen."
15076,"Upon reflection, this was a fucked up and racist thing to say."
15077,"Even if we are racist on instinct (I know I am), that is no excuse for letting our actions and words be racist and hurtful."
15078,"My advice for you is to view the current sentiment objectively (because I am quite sure such sentiments are prevalent globally now), and block any poster who made xenophobic comment."
15079,So what am I suppose to speak as my mother tongue?
15080,"My ancestors were also immigrants in the past, but they didn't fuck over the locals by giving an unfair advantage to their own nationality."
15081,"My argument was that using the narrow definition of xenophobia (which we now seem to be on common ground on), it is less clear how Japan is clearly worse than Singapore."
15082,"Me going ""all in"" on foreigners is to simply establish what meaning of xenophobia this discussion is taking place in, other wise there would be no way forward."
15083,"While Zainichi specifically do not exist in Singapore, we still have a permanent underclass of foreign workers doing all the jobs that we do not want to do."
15084,My army mate walked in on his maid + her bf lying on his bed when he went home from work early one day.
15085,This why some employers don't allow maids to have relationships.
15086,Ok so I take it that you disagree having a racial preference is racist yes?-I disagree that having a racial preference means you're a racist.
15087,"If a chinese prefers to date malays or indians, is that person a racist?"
15088,"They would prefer a primary school that is truly bilingual meaning that the kids communicate with one another fluently in both mother tongue (in his case, Mandarin) and English."
15089,My brothers and I were brought up by maids.
15090,But my mom allows the maid to cane us and give her full authority to scold us and beat us and order us to do things and we are suppose to obey her.
15091,We were brought up to respect our maid as authority in the household.
15092,And how the parents treat the maid transfers to the child.
15093,"My mom and the maids were always like BFF, girlfriends, hang out and chit chat all day type."
15094,"Our maid even on their off day, bring us out for makan and movies with them, out of choice, she would literally say she rather spend her off day with us than with her friends."
15095,"Every evening when the whole family watches TV together, the maid joins us by choice, or she could just go do her own thing."
15096,"Until today, maid goes home, still always stay in contact with us."
15097,I cannot even imagine how badly that maid was treated by the employers for a son to disrespect her like that.
15098,My maid is like VIP of the household.
15099,"Have her own private room and shower, can eat anytime, anywhere and anything she desires, smoke my cigarettes together with me on the couch, everytime must tabao desserts for her, borrowed money from ah long put my phone number also I helped her settle, annual hometown trip of 2 weeks at my expense, want bring her go gai gai she also lazy go, everytime invites her cousin (another maid) over to slack with her..."
15100,"[url=http://www.fivestarsandamoon.com/no-i-do-not-believe-foreign-workers-should-be-housed-on-off-shore-islands/]Five Stars And a MoonMigrant Worker | No, I do not believe foreign workers should be housed on off-shore islands[/url]  **No, I do not believe foreign workers should be housed on off-shore islands** Posted by Benjamin Chiang Benjamin Chiang on December 11, 2013 at 3:32 pm Note: The views expressed in this article are the writer's own and do not represent any organisation, the editorial team and/or the editor."
15101,The idea of housing foreign workers in offshore islands seems to be getting revived following the Little India riot on Sunday night.
15102,National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said back in April that Singapore was open to housing foreign workers at offshore islands.
15103,"The idea is something that many people, the kind who opposed the establishment of foreign worker dormitories in Serangoon, would support."
15104,It would also likely be appreciated by those who join some of the nauseatingly racist discussions online about foreign workers hanging around residential areas in Singapore.
15105,Do you recall the violent rejections when foreign worker dormitories were to be built in the Serangoon area?
15106,"And just last week, a program on Channel News Asia discussed the issue of groups of foreign workers hanging around residential areas at Race Course Road – the remarks were not pretty."
15107,"I was also once a foreign worker working in someone else’s country, and I wasn’t asked to live in such-and-such a district."
15108,"(Photo from “Beyond The Border, Behind The Men“, a group promoting migrant worker integration)  Some say they drink too much."
15109,"Just like how not all of them are rambunctious rioters, not all of us Singaporeans are xenophobic pricks either."
15110,"My comment isn't just about this one article, it's more of noticing that recently our media has been trying very hard to push the idea that Chinese are such privileged racists that even our kids are racist."
15111,"And these pieces do nothing to resolve the problem anyway, all they say is ""look, Singaporean Chinese are being racist, we need to stop this!"""
15112,My comment just highlighting that people really fast pointing the technicalities of racism and start opening their big dictionary book and define what is racism based on their views.
15113,"It's just that in the Singaporean context, the average household do possess easily accessible sums of money which can be a big sum to such migrant workers."
15114,"Foreigners are not particularly 'cheaper', many of the expats interviewed for this article on OP are probably in the higher earning segment of the market."
15115,"When she gets asked about racism in America, she always says that she can't speak on behalf of it because she thinks of herself as Singaporean first and that she does not know the struggles of black people in America firsthand."
15116,"Unfortunately, not that many Singaporeans actually know a black person and see the way they really react to the slur which makes racism towards blacks seem mythical to them."
15117,"My current expat boss moved here for tax reasons, then separated with his wife, and is now addicted to SPGs and female associates in our offices."
15118,"My previous expat boss moved here for the exotic asian culture, was also addicted to SPGs and once famously said ""as if I'd ever report to a Singaporean""."
15119,My previous expat colleague was under qualified and overpaid (2 years exp for over 100k annual) and got away with doing nothing cause he and the boss came from the same country.
15120,I want to believe there are good expats out there.
15121,My current maid said her previous employer only gave her instant noodles to eat for a fking month.
15122,"My dad knows me better than my maids, but that is only because I am very close to him."
15123,"Other than him, my maids know me better than any of my other family, and it’s all because they watch me grew up, from elementary to high school graduation."
15124,They proceeded to hire a Bangladeshi expat at the same salary range
15125,My dad was very specific in his racism which made me think hard about his racism.
15126,It sounds racist but if he is basing in this on the years of experience can you really count that as racism?
15127,"High time for Gov, Society to intervene and be serious about racism."
15128,"My domestic helper has been with me since I was 3, and it's been 16 years that she has been with me and I see her kind of as my older sister."
15129,It always bugged me when I see others treat their domestic helper like some lowly servant as they are here as people who want to provide a service to support their families overseas.
15130,It is really telling when it was only until a few years back when it was mandatory for maids to have a day off per week.
15131,Not to mention all the horror stories where maids are treated like some feral animal and denied basics like nutritional food and standard of living.
15132,My ex neighbour was also an asshole to his maid.
15133,"My expat colleagues pack lunches from home, buy burgers/deliveroo and stuff to eat at their desk, or eat out occasionally."
15134,"My expat friend left early this year to see his family but ever since his company is default WFH, he went to stay in bali instead of coming back here."
15135,"While local employers complain about the lack of ""experienced"" developers, I believe most Singapore fresh grads have an easier time getting a job in the valley than in Singapore because the employers there dont use ""experienced foreign talents"" to whack Singaporeans to death, despite genuine global competition there."
15136,My experience with a lot of people is this: Well I experienced racism in [insert this country] to either dismiss their own racist attitudes or the racist attitudes of others around them within their own racial group.
15137,"You won't know when's a ""good"" time because the government doesn't disclose specifically how many immigrants they're going to accept each round, but that's all the more reason you should try again after renewing your PR."
15138,"My grandma \*needs\* a domestic helper, it would literally be impossible for her to live day-to-day otherwise."
15139,Without the help of our domestic helper I cannot imagine how we can take care of them.
15140,My family is incredibly racist.
15141,Being raised with them caused me to became extremely racist too.
15142,My family literally treats the maid as a maid.
15143,"Youngest sister was spoilt rotten and could scold the maid, elder siblings with impunity (Something I despise my mother for)"
15144,My family used to have a domestic helper back in my primary school days.
15145,"My family was really racist growing up, interestingly it was growing up myself, getting on Discord and playing games with people from all over the globe which exposed me to different cultures and realizing ""yo my parents are fucked up racist boomers""     To this date, they still believe that Malays are ""lazy"" and Indians are all ""liars and thieves""     I truly believe they'll never change because the opinions are so deeply rooted into their brains"
15146,"My father always told me never to call them maids and I would say that compared to the people around me, especially my own family, we treated them well."
15147,"My father is the same too, and he has become very racist and hateful ever since watching those videos."
15148,"My first ever encounter with systemic racism - super memorable because I was pretty young, and it made me realise at a young age how unfair society really is."
15149,"TLDR; you can work as hard and say ""meritocracy will take its course"", but systemic racism prevents us from doing so."
15150,"My first thoughts about the 20 year old who threw a metal mug hard enough to break his maid's nose is: fuck that guy, I hope he goes to jail for a long time."
15151,"When I grew up, we had a maid, and we were brought up to never disrespect her."
15152,If the 20 year old grew up being taught that maids were underneath him and they should obey like slaves... and he threw things hard enough at her to break her nose...
15153,"NS helped reduce racism for me, University gave me a chance to make mistakes and learn to be less (though as you read, not completely) sexist."
15154,"And I would say that it's the answer, except we all know that it's also the same source that emboldens, even grows, racism, sexism, and other isms."
15155,Not all migrant workers :)
15156,Edit: Oh I remember my grandmother keep thinking the Japanese tenant is the maid.
15157,"Singapore's an amazing place for expats looking to learn more about asia, please come!"
15158,There is no separate line for locals and foreign workers.
15159,"I have merely pointed out the claim that ""expats who arrive in Singapore are top contributors to their companies"" is not necessarily true as it is definitely untrue in my company."
15160,My friend’s maid only used to eat chicken feet when they cooked chicken at home.
15161,My friend’s maid sleeps in the store room.
15162,Other than that I’ve observed floor plans of large bungalows in Singapore on architecture websites have windowless maid rooms just enough for one small bed.
15163,"I'm planning on visiting her family in Singapore after that, but concerned Singapore will shut down the VTL or borders completely."
15164,I believed that how a domestic worker is being treated depends on the heart of their employers.
15165,We do not call her a maid since she is not a slave not a maid.
15166,"My grandmother only give her maid instant noodle for lunch, it is very common"
15167,I'm less incline to support the racism angle since Prima Deli is a Halal chain.
15168,Since most/all of VTL flights are via SQ.
15169,My guess is they'll start with: work permit holders and business travellers.
15170,"This has proved the system works"" by Minister Iswaran), then leisure travel for residents will commence ala VTL style."
15171,"Australians are racist to singaporians because Aussies feel they ""rank higher"" in some imaginary ladder compared to non native-borns."
15172,"Likewise, some Singaporeans feel they ""rank higher"" than foreign workers so they treat them with disdain too."
15173,And the latest video in this sub is of a Chinese guy getting salty and racist cause Indians are ‘preying’ on his race.
15174,Its true that shitty employers are pretty common but the FDW are still attracted by the salaries.
15175,"Comparing a butler to a maid is a joke, please educate yourself on butler job scope, it's essentially a PA job."
15176,I would barely trust most FDW with my kids let alone managing my estate
15177,My honest take: Singapore-India CECA isn't the problem.
15178,"And to be honest, as someone who witnessed neo-nazi parades in Germany and right wing protests in Denmark, the PSP fixating onto Singapore-India CECA is a pretty mild reaction."
15179,"My household employs a FDW and while we don’t treat her like family per se, we treat her with respect and dignity."
15180,"She’s always checking if our FDW has enough food, and whenever she runs out of something (like a loaf of bread) it’s just automatically added to our grocery list."
15181,"Our FDW knows our wifi password, and it’s honestly insane to think that some people force them to survive entirely on mobile data??"
15182,"As far as logistics go (looking for a place, getting employment passes, etc."
15183,"Although expat packages are becoming more meager, it would have been convenient to have our moving expenses covered."
15184,Most of our friends our expats.
15185,I've never gone to happy hour with my local coworkers--only with my husband's expat coworkers.
15186,"We hardly ever seen police patrolling the streets or even meter maids, for that matter."
15187,Our employers issued us employment passes once we started working.
15188,"I emailed a US expat from CDC Atlanta who was here; he kindly sent me a bunch of contacts, who I emailed."
15189,"As far as we know, hiring a live-in maid is a big plus here."
15190,"Most locals are xenophobic here, usually against people from China."
15191,I don't get all the CECA hate.
15192,With regards to racism...
15193,My initial point was not to see who is more racist.
15194,"My initial question wasn't who is more racist, more about racism in Singapore."
15195,"LHL also admits that racism exists, but that is more the fault of the individual, and should not be seen as Chinese Privilege."
15196,"My issue with this is if she has a problem with racism, voice it out sure no problem it is her rights, but why pull in Chinese when it has no relation at all with Chinese?"
15197,My maid borrowed from loan shark before and I got the threatening call as well.
15198,"My maid is able to provide for her parents care and to send her kid to university to get a medical degree, hopefully breaking a cycle of poverty in her family that they had no hope of getting out of."
15199,My maid like empress dowager.
15200,My maid literally refuses to not clean the windows - even after we’ve repeatedly told her not to do it as it’s dangerous.
15201,My maid's sister is also a dmoestic helper but she went abroad to singapore.
15202,"Before she left, friends of the husband (of my domestic helper) forged the sister a dummy passport."
15203,That's all I was told about my maid's sister.
15204,My maid/housekeeper/helper from Indonesia lived with my family and I from 1998-2017.
15205,"My main gripe with the local maid scene is that maids typically get a super small maids room/bomb shelter, and get paid like 700 dollars."
15206,"There's only ""nothing wrong with having maids"" imo if they are paid that well, and also if they get a proper room."
15207,"People poke fun at me but hey, I passed O level mother tongue."
15208,"I still remember this xenophobic aunty screaming at my mom to go back to her home country, and the helplessness we both felt afterwards."
15209,"Then when I call her racist shes like ""Noooo Im not racist but sometimes they really liddat""."
15210,My mom is super nice to these maids/domestic helpers .
15211,She used to explain to me that we have to treat them with respect and kindness as they come here across countries trying to make a living as maids for strangers and leave their families at home for a few dollars .
15212,When I was young I addressed our family maid as aunty too.
15213,"You're forgetting expats/foreign works have no support network in Singapore, no one they can rely on in an emergency."
15214,"She mentioned she voted PAP because the anti-immigration rhetoric was verging on xenophobia, and she was so put off by that that she'd rather vote against them to never see them in parliament (though since this is West Coast GRC, the chances of them getting in is nil anyway)"
15215,"I think that at the very least, immigrants and PRs who are naturalised through family ties or marriage should be exempt from this requirement."
15216,My mother tongue/native language is Singapore English.
15217,"For me, Mandarin Chinese is merely a language for the tv and school/work/shopping and I don't feel comfortable claiming it as a ""mother tongue""."
15218,"Few months back we were eating dinner as a family while watching the news and the foreign worker Covid situation came up, and she started talking about how their presence was a huge waste of her taxpayer money and what not."
15219,My neighbors who are expats told me that they moved out in August because they wanted a bigger place that could accommodate their WFH.
15220,My neighbour's maid instructed to wear mask indoors also.
15221,I am quite indifferent about the foreign workers living conditions.
15222,"As you said, people who thinks they are racist will continue to do so."
15223,I do not want to argue about racism (which exists and is a pressing issue) or what the data will be used for.
15224,"My original post didn’t mean to project that kind of impression, so please don’t get me wrong... the reality is that FDWs are susceptible to loan groups who prey on them."
15225,"Existence of HOME, MWC2 really helps but I agree with you - Singapore as a whole needs to reflect on how we treat foreign workers."
15226,"We ended up making a police report as per protocol but also asking assistance like please help to bring her back to the maid agency we already located her on your behalf, police was like nah fam you gotta do it on your own."
15227,My parents always told me and my bro to respect our helpers and treat them like family so it's uncomfortable whenever we go over to our cousins house bc they always have a new maid.
15228,My parents aren’t “racist” but my dad does have a disdain for those of other religions and nonbelievers .
15229,"My parents have hired a few maids before & from what i know,i think they are being taught 'i am just here to work'."
15230,My parents never even gave my maid the wifi password because they have the belief that if they have it they will skive off at work.
15231,I had my own fibre line installed because my dad refused to recognise there were issues with starhub cable latency and I gave the maid the wifi password.
15232,"Also my maid surprised me after that by buying a 2nd hand laptop (probably like 2 months salary), got locked out of it thanks to some shenanigans with the previous owner not signing out of their windows live accounts and she brought it to me for fixing lol."
15233,Treat your maids nicely and they will trust you and respect you.
15234,My parents treat my maid similar to yours except for the discipline part.
15235,"But I think maids should be treated like that, hang out together, watch TV together."
15236,"My parents were the pretty standard racist Malays are lazy, Indians are smelly abunehneh types."
15237,"We are slowly beginning to look for different spa manager jobs in Singapore and we have a lot of questions involving language expectations, salary ranges, expat hiring, etc."
15238,"PM mentions that migrant workers are welcomed members of our society, but it’s things like that that make these statements ring hollow."
15239,"Got racists, assholes, queue cutters."
15240,"Doesnt matter if expats also were asymptomatic, but by interacting with them he is only spreading it further."
15241,"Don’t make it like it’s a stupid racist thing that only Singaporean’s do, and make it a massive ‘Singaporean’s are racist’ session."
15242,Being completely racist is perfectly legal.
15243,My point is there are a lot of foreigners living in condos like these and anyone who is insinuating that it's only Singaporean residents in these condos who oppose maids using the facilities are wrong.
15244,The maid's crime is lying.
15245,The maid said she was forbidden to go back to Indo and she also came clean quite quickly.
15246,My point was that Singaporeans shouldn’t be entitled to things that immigrants aren’t.
15247,"The logic you are going with puts people who were born in sg above people born elsewhere, which is irrational and xenophobic."
15248,Took me 20yrs to realize that’s racist.
15249,They generally make a huge cut from earnings considering how little they pay foreign workers.
15250,My school's near some upscale estate and every evening on walks to the station I would see domestic helpers walking their employers dog/dogs.
15251,The domestic helpers would be on their phone and oblivious to the dog's needs.
15252,At times the racism is just embraced and we laugh about it.
15253,"Anyone who hasn't already should go Google ""blackface"" to understand it better - it's actually a very well documented racist phenomenon, with many good sources and reference."
15254,We didn't want her to study in an SAP school bc we dont want her to pick up racism.
15255,"I cautioned to her that it's most probably not bc they are purposely racist but maybe the other students voted for the student bc she's more approachable, some slight unconscious preference?"
15256,"As a minority myself, despite the systemic racism encountered throughout my life, I don't wish to give up this fight to make this country a better place."
15257,To let the racists win?
15258,[The same racists who would flee Singapore if there's a war?
15259,"So, it is not just expats that are thinking of leaving."
15260,My theory is that VTLs were designed to greatly favour SQ.
15261,"Sure they will say any airline can fly to Singapore, but with quarantines in place, VTLs is where the money is."
15262,Non-VTL flights are empty.
15263,"VTLs are a Singapore invention, were meant to be temporary, no other country created anything similar (because it's dumb)."
15264,There has to be some way to motivate students to study their mother tongue.
15265,"When I ask my friends why they think the ad is racist, they divert the question by saying things like 'I mean, they could have just picked actors of different races, how hard is that?'"
15266,"In other words, make it unprofitable for agents and agencies to work with racist landlords, and leave racist landlords with few agents willing to work with them."
15267,"Of course “preferences” could be motivated by racism, but we can’t police people’s minds."
15268,My two cents from a non-Singaporean to give you some diversity of points of view and guess why this topic is so shocking to ang mohs:  * This practice is strange coming from a country linking its advertized success and particularity (dare I say moral superiority) to social cohesion and cohesion between ethicities: why should ang mohs believe you are not like 'racist Malaysia' or 'communist Indonesia' when SG allows for an underclass of foreigners to be exploited and treated as sub-humans?
15269,"In Europe it's been ages that maid almost disappeared and in the hay days of maids they had separates rooms and bathrooms in different levels of the same building, or their own rooms elsewhere."
15270,Without some governement intervention or social trend (like Europe did to ban cigarettes at work and in public spaces or to minimize race-based recruiting) I do not see SG changing their practice on maids any time soon.
15271,"No matter if maids culture is wanted or part of such ''no big waves'' tactic, it's sad to see from an European perspective because it lets us believe that Asian values and culture are precisely these relics from the past (slave-like workers, wet markets, control on media and freedom of speech, arranged matchmaking, etc.)"
15272,So every nation and culture has its lot of malfunctions and oddities to improve on but you can't be surprized the issue of maids gathers so much interest from abroad.
15273,"My uncle is a kind of an asshole about anything regarding HK, SG government as well as random topics that he has only half-cocked knowledge about (US politics, foreign relations with other countries, Malaysia)  The family group chat is occasionally flooded with his racist and uninformed views about HK (The protestors all deserve to be shot and Singapore government is perfect), SG politics (The elite don't care about you so we all should be selfish assholes), other races in Singapore (Malays are predisposed to be lazy and stupid; Indians from India all believe in the caste system and are all universally classist assholes despite never traveling to India or having a job since he was 25 (he's in his 50s))  Sometimes I just want to tell him to STFU"
15274,"Given that, I don't understand the point of VTL."
15275,My understanding is that most returning expats leave their company within 2years after returning.
15276,"My understanding is, it's cheaper to have a maid than send the kid to child care in Singapore."
15277,"A maid can take care of your child like a second mom, or outsourced mom, so you can focus on work and bring home dough for enough money to send your kid to University later."
15278,My upvotes for you.. not all singaporeans are racist.. there are always some bad apples in every lot/ country.
15279,Singapore government provided 2 cruise ships for those foreign workers.
15280,">   >Also, those charity organisations with nothing better to do are taking the opportunity to ask Singaporeans to donate to those foreign workers."
15281,">   >(Note, he refers to ""those people"" (foreign workers) in a very condescending way.)"
15282,"Main reason being the government keeps saving ""those foreign workers""."
15283,">   >In Malaysia, the foreign workers live in lousy conditions, and the government doesn't care about them."
15284,"Singapore government gives the foreign workers rice, meat and even curry."
15285,">   >Other countries' Covid death rates are very high, but Singapore's death rate is very low because the government treats the foreign workers too well."
15286,"The most important thing is, why should we care about the foreign workers so much?"
15287,">   >The silliest thing is, even other foreigners like Phillipines and Indonesian maids are joining in the complaints."
15288,"Many foreign workers take the government for granted, they turn their own problems into the Singapore government's problem."
15289,"My views on the expat community most come from the Cold Storage at great world city and the bus stop near Ion beside the Overseas Family School, where I see many expatriate mums camp to pick up their lovely little kids."
15290,"Apart from that, I spend most of my time in army camp, where I don't get any views of expats."
15291,"Edit: context, have kids and childcare is also v expensive but ends too early for us, so need maid to send back and forth"
15292,My wife is flying to the us and then flying to sg after staying in the us for 14 days cus there is no direct VTL from uae.
15293,My wife picked our FDW with this concern in mind.
15294,"My wife's work lost a bunch of expats; most ended up in Sydney just before the latest outbreak, although a few ended up in Melbourne, just as it went into lockdown."
15295,"My sister was not a rude or bad student mind you, just pure racism bullshit."
15296,"These maids cannot use hairdryer, charge phone must use power bank, weak or no WiFi but no money for data."
15297,"If NS if your solution to xenophobia then that is a deeply problematic situation since PRs and new citizens with no ability to do NS simply have no means to become ""a true blue Singaporean""."
15298,VTL direct flight on home team Sg airlines.
15299,"Ha, I had 3 years of no air travel- so spent that on the VTL flight."
15300,Nah I don't think the point is to equate NSF with domestic helpers.
15301,"The point is that if we already think being NSF is bad enough, then we should be thinking that a ""not-so-young maybe-healthy possibly-married-with-kids-already 20+ year old with irrelevant job experience who doesn't get to go out much, food provided at work but no additional risk pay and probably sending their salary back to their family"" domestic helper is having it relatively worse."
15302,"On the spectrum of possible actions that malaysia and singapore can take includes totally blocking the VTL ala japan, Israel and Switzerland(until a few days ago), or increasing the amount of testing to catch infection before it spreads too wide."
15303,I think this falls under casual racism born from ignorance and negligence.
15304,Nah let those expat pay more tax that is equivalent to our cpf rate.
15305,"Thank you for showing me the light  Sarcasm aside that is one huge illogical interpretation you have there, blaming the Government’s inaction of improving the living conditions of migrant workers in dormitories solely on the loss of 1 GRC in an election 10 years ago amid a national swing against the PAP."
15306,"I mean, the world is indeed racist - but doesn't mean it'll stay that way."
15307,"Also, ""We as Singaporeans should combat racism and ignorance together""."
15308,They would feel the same way for the immigrants who failed to localize in America.
15309,Not as sensational as racism.
15310,"Nah you're not racist, it's just the shills around here."
15311,"Moreover, I feel like it delegitimizes Chinese immigrants as true citizens of their chosen countries because it suggests that we may be more loyal to the motherland or something."
15312,"Nah, if you're American you won't face the same xenophobia that is directed towards the mainland Chinese and the Bangladeshis, if at all."
15313,"Nah, just lock her up with the infected migrant worker in a small space, until she thinks of a solution worthy of her million dollar salary."
15314,It can be pretty toxic and racist when certain topics arise.
15315,"Nah, they prefer to whine and complain about how good immigrants from under developed countries have it."
15316,She said that they were focused on the practical bits - keeping migrant workers safe and healthy as were the main concerns that they reflected.
15317,"you are just a ""minority"" ,no racism towards you."
15318,The racism that exist in here is between malay and chinese.
15319,Some people are xenophobic cause they believe what others say without verifying anything.
15320,Others are xenophobic cause they experienced too many times unpleasant things.
15321,"All I'm trying to say is, landlords are not generally racist or xenophobic."
15322,[https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/02/singapore-rental-racism-prc-and-indian-tenants-often-deemed-undesirable.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/02/singapore-rental-racism-prc-and-indian-tenants-often-deemed-undesirable.html) old article as an example.
15323,Name one non-SQ VTL between SG and US.
15324,"Aviva MINDEF insurance is cheap, so you'll be better insured than foreign workers."
15325,Don't ever fucking pretend and tell me that Singapore is not a racist place.
15326,"Check  Mustafa caters to foreign worker needs, so they shop there."
15327,"Also one of the few places foreign workers can go without getting glaring, dirty looks from everyone else."
15328,Need measures to incentivise them to hire locals (more attractive pay etc) if not they are just gonna ask for more help with their migrant workers tbh
15329,"Need more people like you 🙏 too many of the locals are racist bigoted shits that bash the migrants, and ass lick and cuck any white person- need to rid that neo colonialism mindset"
15330,Need to make sure the maid understand you.
15331,It's in the article   Edit: and of course this anti-racism thing now
15332,Can you say you're neutral about racism or sexism?
15333,Never an issue with the house.... yes there is a lot of work with a house this size but the tasks that can be done sits on what the maid is able to cover in her working hours.
15334,So I’d say the advertisers were ignorant morons but I wouldn’t call them outright racists since they issued a apology and took it down.
15335,Never expected to see importance and mother tongue in the same sentence.
15336,"Never had a domestic helper, but looks like they are making her do all the parenting tasks for all their children."
15337,"Never had a maid, but seen some friends and relatives being over reliant on helpers."
15338,"Never had a problem IRL, not sure if relevant but it's pretty obvious on social media that many if not a majority of Singaporeans (no statistics for this, just the general feeling i get) despise mainland Chinese immigrants/PRs, to the point where the word 'PRC' is used almost as a slur."
15339,"There are rude and racist mainland Chinese, but there are also Singaporeans (of any race!)"
15340,I call her maid simply because it is one syllable.
15341,Never have I generalised anything about foreign workers who sweat and risk their lives to provide core services to the nation.
15342,"I also hope that before people starts slamming someone for being a racist, have you ever wondered why people look at it that way?"
15343,Just shouting out and judging the person a racist makes you no different from a racist too.
15344,"I know of friends who cracks stereotypical racist jokes, I hated it, and I never joined in with him."
15345,"But if a person becomes 'racist' due to personal encounters, that is another story."
15346,Never knew our migrant workers could vote
15347,"(Coffee, black, extra strong, less sugar fyi)  COL wise it's probably significantly cheaper than San Fran, unless you intend to live solely in an expat bubble."
15348,"Might experience some discomfort/casual racism because as heterogeneous as our society is, African-Americans are rarely seen on our shores."
15349,https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/husband-alleged-maid-abuser-tells-court-wife-has-bulldog-face-not-violent
15350,I get the impression that she only went on this rant because someone insulted her profession; I wonder how many families would be crippled without their maids.
15351,"Never return as citizen, return as foreign talent"
15352,"I was just pointing out that calling it xenophobia alone wouldn’t make sense, and there’s no logical economic reason for a landlord to be purely xenophobic."
15353,Never saw business for $2K even pre-VTL announcement.
15354,"Demand is up way more with the VTL, fuel costs are up and SIA is still losing money so expect to pay higher rates than pre-COVID times."
15355,"FWIW, salaries have increased from $380 in 2011 to $550 this year, in the case of [Indonesian](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/demand-for-indonesian-maids-likely-to-fall-in-singapore-after-pay-rise) and [Filipino](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/bosses-must-now-pay-filipino-maids-at-least-550-a-month) maids."
15356,"> If you raise your prices to pay the maids more but your competitor doesn't, people will use your competitor."
15357,"And more maids will apply to your agency because they get higher wages, so you get a larger and better applicant pool to choose from, which means customers will still come to you."
15358,"Besides, every company competes on prices with their rivals; I don't see why there should be an exception for maid agencies."
15359,"Imposing this idea of systemic racism which actually did occur for the black Americans, and transplanting it to Singaporean or British context is disingenuous and lacks critical insight."
15360,"Am able to connect with malaysians Singaporeans , malays or chinese or expats ."
15361,New HDBs aren’t just for immigrants.
15362,Having a maid is a very foreign and old-fashioned concept to us.
15363,Finding out how many maids Singapore has was pretty shocking to me
15364,You can buy a VTL flight back today as long as you are returning after then.
15365,"Next time just put your real face and an Indian name in your profile, that will filter out the racist drivers."
15366,"Sorry mate, but it's SG and racism is something you're going to have to live with."
15367,Ngee An Polytechnic suspends Chinese Singaporean man over racist remarks made in this [viral video](https://www.connectedtoindia.com/ngee-an-polytechnic-suspends-man-over-racist-remarks-made-in-viral-video-9212.html)
15368,"Ngl, I'm quite shocked that the racist guy turns out to be a (presumably highly educated) lecturer, a profession that many people would look up to a role model for the next generation."
15369,"Growing up I always appreciated the fact that I can read and write in two languages, although I know many people struggled with their mother tongue even when they have high scores for other subjects."
15370,"The funny thing about Lee is despite how much he knew about these cultural sensitivities he would advise the Chinese to adopt english as first language, the Indians to remove their caste system, and the Japanese to open their doors to immigrants to solve low birth rates with a straight face."
15371,"Nice sentiment, but the problem with this is that everyone will agree that they don't like racists and xenophobes, but no one will confess to actually being one - even the people who are very obviously that."
15372,Nice to know that the Govt is helping to protect our migrant workers through flu vaccinations.
15373,"I’ll be grateful by giving this post an upvote, I’m sure it will help show my appreciation to these foreign workers."
15374,"VTL flight back all early afternoon one, waste 1 day."
15375,"Nice, trying to justify xenophobia and racism."
15376,You're absolutely the kind of immigrant we need.
15377,"And those flying in without VTL, yes follow category based restrictions."
15378,No I am not aware of any apology from this racist company.
15379,Which is why it took a lot of people by surprised when it was called out for being racist especially since we still have Phua Chu Kang who is basically an Indian dude pretending to be Chinese (yes I know he is half but most people see him as Indian)  Of course culture can change and what is acceptable in the past may not be acceptable today.
15380,"However, it is possible for someone to have conflicting world views without realizing it, such as identifying as a liberal whilst still carrying xenophobic views."
15381,No I meant people thinking a Chinese person of being a racist just because some other Chinese person is racist is racism also.
15382,No action is racist by itself.
15383,It becomes racist if the same action would not be taken if it was a different race.
15384,And I’m 100% sure that the whole subreddit would cry racism if the UK were to ban all SG flights.
15385,No an expat doesn't make more than a local.
15386,"Most locals just aren't very good at it, hence why you have expats filling these key roles, especially in management."
15387,"If that had been detected early, it would have been stamped out and all the current and future high throughput testing of migrant workers (supposed to be every 2 weeks!)"
15388,Covid virus does not differentiate between expats and locals.
15389,While expats do probably make more money than locals but the costs are very high too and these are unavoidable a like children’s education (2-3k/month per child in cheapest international school etc).
15390,"If Singapore instituted this policy for all international travel without any VTL-special flights, I would still welcome it."
15391,"No doubt racism is a very serious issue that needs to be handled sensitively, but I also think “racism” is simply a convenient cover to try and paper over the real underlying issues in this context."
15392,"If indeed, we chinese are being responsible for the bulk of racist incidents in Singapore, then let them be hit by the book as many times as necessary."
15393,Maybe there are some social cliques that prefer talking in their mother tongue but you are fucking lying if you are telling me the Chinese students only speak Chinese and the Malay only speak Malay.
15394,I definitely want to make friends with the expats.
15395,I'm the OP from the racist landlord chat.
15396,"By that I mean, look at how much they keep harping on CECA, whereas CSFTA (China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement) gets *zero mention*."
15397,"So you can't say they are anti-foreigner or xenophobic, if they are simping harder for the CCP to have more foreign influence here than the PAP lol."
15398,"The issue at hand though is the job creation that the government is trying to achieve and whether that’s something which, strictly speaking, requires expats."
15399,Most reasonable commentators aren’t saying “all foreigners get out” but what they are pointing out is the ridiculous slant some of these recent articles or opinion pieces take to try and portray singapore as some sort of xenophobic hub.
15400,No hopefully they give up entirely on the VTL concept which is completely unnecessary and serves only to make it look like there's progress when there really isn't and force people to pay extremely inflated fares on the few appointed allowed flights.At this point in time people arriving are no more 'dangerous' than people here who are suspected of being cases and should be subject at the maximum to a few day at home and ART tests if they want to go out.
15401,The VTLs are a dumb scheme which only serves to stop things opening up properly
15402,"No i didn't claim he is expat, just that it is unsurprising that it isn't Chinese and doesn't have to be mentioned because usually those with similar flavour of ethnicity are usually at loggerheads at one another e.g."
15403,No idea why PM wasted so much time talking about incidents with racism when we've already solved racism so long ago!
15404,"Is not as if we can do a survey, hey r u a racist?"
15405,Or a casual racist?
15406,"No if you are an EP/S-PASS, VTLs are the only way to get a more or less preapproved return"
15407,MOM even fined the dormitory operators but did not follow up on how to improve their living conditions.
15408,These dormitory operators are reaping private profits; why should the government use public money to resolve the issue and take care of the workers?
15409,I was referring to western expats in my comments if that helps.
15410,https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/Singapore-ftas/-/media/ESG/Files/Non-Financial-Assistance/For-Companies/Free-Trade-Agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/CECA_Legal_Text.pdf
15411,"No it should not be ok. And if you don't recognize that homeowners discriminate based on race far more often 'expat' or 'particular age-group', then I'd recommend going out into the housing rental market"
15412,"Lastly, this whole 'intent' being necessary to racism is extremely stupid and shows how fucking shallow the level of our national discourse about race is."
15413,They would be too dumb to have any racist intent.
15414,"Also, I totally hear you because I've faced all sorts of racism here, ranging from subtle and snide to intense and insane."
15415,"Let's give domestic workers their day off."""
15416,"Imagine if you are of a certain race but do not have pets, nor cook curry, nor cause irreparable damage to every place you stay in- and this person gets rejected from every landlord basically because of their race and supposedly “higher propensity” to do certain things and your implication that its much easier to screen people this way- this is clearly racism."
15417,Non-VTL flights are still abundant and outnumber VTL flights.
15418,Some parents just jealous that the new VTLs can’t apply to them.
15419,I'm sure everyone perceives racism differently
15420,And if you're coming from UK etc you're usually in a managerial or at least high paid position/even expat package so the cost of living isn't such a big deal for you either.
15421,"Compare all this to how it is back there with the overt racism, high crime rates in some neighbourhoods and cities, lack of efficiency etc and its easy to see why foreigners like it here so much but locals all want to move out."
15422,"No lah most maids have experience, if not in Singapore, at least in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia etc."
15423,If people were to choose transfer maids instead of new maids where you can have lots of replacements they might have a better experience.
15424,No lawmaker but I would punish racist people by ‘volunteering’ the racist to help the community of the race that was offended.
15425,No leh  Apparantly got groups of people think you are racist if you have preferences in renting.
15426,"No leh, we have never heard a single foreign worker demand for an apology, so they must be ok living in slave like conditions."
15427,No maid employer is immune to the institutional circumstances that incentivise the hiring of domestic helpers.
15428,The wages domestic helpers are paid here are reasonable relative to the international market.
15429,The issue of human trafficking and migrant worker rights is one that has to be dealt with on an international level.
15430,Is there a better country for domestic helpers to work in other than Singapore?
15431,"And there is nothing to feel guilty, you just need to be aware of your privilege and be responsible to push back against racism."
15432,That being said I don't think racism is that controversial or acknowledging it exist in Singapore should be controversial
15433,"As a kid i never thought about ""power dynamics"", parents are parents, and maid is someone I hung out with when parents are not at home."
15434,I am a firm believer that maids shouldn't be disciplining the child.
15435,"Not that maids are ""subservient"" in the wider sense, but parents have authority to hit/scold/teach/discipline/make decisions."
15436,"I'm close to my parents because they took such a central role in my life, and didnt leave the key parts of rearing to the maid."
15437,The truth of the matter is no locals will say it to your face if they dislike white people and I'm putting it out there so OP knows and you call it racist for pointing it out.
15438,You can book VTLs now for flights coming in after 20th Jan.
15439,"No no no, someone told me only people with power can be racist, and minorities have no power ergo they cannot be racist."
15440,I would be convinced that the US has as open an immigration policy as Singapore if the data bore that comparison out to be approximately equal.
15441,"You are able to hire a maid if you so prefer, pending other requirements."
15442,"No offence, but the irony is not lost when her own country practises blatant racism against the minorities."
15443,Yet I don't see her criticizing those racist politicians in her country.
15444,But Malaysia is far worse when it comes to racism.
15445,There is literally no proof that CECA is anything substantial at all.
15446,"As an Indian who is involved in recruiting as well, I know for a fact that there is no such CECA thing that makes it easier for Indians to get visas."
15447,Ask literally any SG person in recruiting if they have it easier to recruit Indians on EPs  because of CECA - show me even one such example anywhere.
15448,But this CECA nonsense is just a bunch of hyperbole and propaganda.
15449,"Sadly, nobody wants to hear this, as so many people desperately want to believe the government is screwing them over and there is an easy solution out there (just stop CECA, and SG will prosper suddenly)."
15450,"No offense taken on points raised, but offense taken on language usage ;)  On the contrary I see some maids that actually do dine with their employers outside... but those employers look like the super rich kinds and they usually also need the maid around for some reason outside (taking care of elderly or something similar)."
15451,I have definitely observed such employers paying for a pretty nice meal for the maids when they are outside helping and she does dine together with them normally.
15452,I also share a toilet with my maid (I live in a condo) but I don't really find it demeaning or anything.
15453,"A more common problem I have encountered is how some employers are paying maids to be helpers doing domestic work, but are expecting something like executive assistant level competency."
15454,"For me if my maid doesn't do some tasks very well but borderline satisfactory, I just take it that the other family members are overloading her and I would carry out said task by myself."
15455,I rarely even remind my maid about tasks which are slightly unsatisfactory to my standards.
15456,No official confirmation regarding VTL passengers yet.
15457,"Does it then mean that before the foreign workers dormitory clusters were discovered, they were all monsters too?"
15458,No one commenting on the fact she has 2 domestic helpers?
15459,No one is denying that there is racism in Singapore.
15460,"But you are saying racism exists only betweeen the malays and the chinese, which is bullshit."
15461,No one is holding expats against their wishes.
15462,The expats who wish to settle down are not being considered.
15463,"As far as I know, no one has meted out any special treatment to expats pre or post pandemic."
15464,Despite all this there are expats who are still staying.
15465,There would definitely be some bad apples but that would be the case be it a local or an expat.
15466,Just notify them that you the maid is no longer working for you and has left the country.
15467,"No one likes to be called out on racism, or be reminded to examine their comments."
15468,"Sure, not every comment on here is racist, but there are far too many racist comments which are upvoted."
15469,And any comment that tries to call out the racism is then mocked and downvoted.
15470,"It's not smart or funny to preemptively mock the comments calling out racism, you're just too sensitive to actually look at the racism that exists on the sub."
15471,The reason why the govt had to clarify that the decision to close borders to non citizens and PRs isn't a racist move is because way too many of us are.
15472,Finding an entire race of people unattractive is racist.
15473,"That’s the thing about racism, it’s a snap judgment."
15474,U cross a road and you go from VTL to non VTL...
15475,You need to start guessing why u/HmmmSureWhatever has such a strong agenda to defend CECA and attack critics of job discrimination in Singapore.
15476,"And to answer your original question, yes, Singaporeans are pretty racist."
15477,They've never actually lived outside Singapore so they don't realise how racist they actually are.
15478,And to take the whole continent of Europe and say that this tiny island is less racist than that is ridiculous.
15479,This guy came on a thread showing RACISM to say there's no racism.
15480,I’m also an expat and know many people from the UK with little formal education working here.
15481,No problem with CECA if the hired is competent.
15482,Hope that helps if you visit during VTL times 🙂
15483,"I understand the issue, I've done signed a [change.org](https://change.org) petition, i'm not racist."
15484,"No racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism or other offensive language will be tolerated on this sub."
15485,The problem is that most of the opposition here on this subreddit isn't coming from a safety purpose but rather rooted in with xenophobia.
15486,"No shit the vast majority of Chinese people here are Han, and household language determines mother tongue."
15487,"No shit, it’s too obvious when they open VTL to India."
15488,"No thanks to the dear governments of said expats restricting vaccine supply, if we had enough supply we would have vaccinated said expats (as evident by how we vaccinated Foreign frontline workers and Malaysian truck drivers even before most Singaporeans got vaccinated)."
15489,"But sadly the selfishness and indeed, vaccine nationalism of the governments of western expats has led us to this unfortunate situation where supplies are constricted and have to be prioritised and in that situation citizens must come first."
15490,Except that they are perhaps worse and infinitely more hypocritical considering that they these are the very same countries that love to wave humanitarian values and human rights around as a stick when it suits them and yet are playing vaccine nationalism on a global scale with western countries being prioritised while non-western ones suffer (both from vaccine shortage and from the incessant criticism of expats who don't understand that it is their very government which caused this situation in the first place).
15491,In contrast we are only doing it on a local scale between Singaporeans and expats **because** the vaccine nationalism of the dear government of western expats forced us to.
15492,What if this party founder institutes a policy of imposing fines for illegally parking your car - is that racist?
15493,No they cannot put the costs for quarantaine on the maid.
15494,"It's not unfortunate events, it's the classic tale of Singapore families exploiting their maids."
15495,Total foreign worker in dorm is like hundred thousands...
15496,No they will say he is xenophobic......
15497,No where have I mentioned being racist.
15498,It’s more of a suggestion that could be implemented to reduce friction between migrant workers and locals to start with.
15499,I was stressed about a smooth entry too because so many things could go wrong (I wasn't even on a VTL flight) but it was very uneventful for me thankfully.
15500,Those expats who can't stay just let them go because now that balance is heavily tilted to one side.
15501,Unless you are saying we spend 99% of our resources on locals then 1% on expats fine by me.
15502,but maids in Singapore don’t have anybody really looking out for them so it’s even worse for them.
15503,"In fact, the fact that you three crack racist jokes with each other in a non-racist manner serves actually to subvert the racism that give rise to such jokes, so to speak."
15504,I am reminded of Zizek’s take on racist jokes:  https://qz.com/398723/slavoj-zizek-thinks-political-correctness-is-exactly-what-perpetuates-prejudice-and-racism/  The part on racist jokes starts at the 5 min mark.
15505,"No, I literally have said they’re racists."
15506,This is a critical analysis I made of one of his posts regarding migrant worker dorms.
15507,Have you considered that the reason our awareness towards the plight of the migrant workers blew up when it was hitherto unknown to us has less to do with social network and more to do with our collective shock at the revelation of a terrible situation?
15508,Have you considered that economic gains from cheap labour are not mutually exclusive from the more humane treatment of our migrant workers?
15509,Have you considered that your conclusion that migrant workers should live in dorms have 0 relevance to the current discourse on how we can improve their lives and the living conditions in their dorms?
15510,"Just because someone refuses something, due to a preference, he/she gets labelled a racist."
15511,"No, but a bunch of lonely maids cosying up to ISIS fighters on social media."
15512,"If you look through the MHA press release archives, there's a bunchnof cases of maids getting radicalised like this."
15513,"No, expats are just immigrants."
15514,Hate the term “expat”.
15515,You can take a look at the sg expatforums if you need to enquire more.
15516,"If you are high earner you can look at personalized employment pass, not sure if that is still a thing though."
15517,"There are a lot of reasons why you would not eat together with your maid, one primarily being that she is not family and dinner time is critical family time for a lot of households."
15518,](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/opinion/surekha-a-yadav/article/is-singapore-a-racist-country) 2.
15519,[So... let's speak about racism](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3te4xl/so_lets_speak_about_racism/) 4.
15520,"No, it's true, passive racism exists."
15521,Its easy to say you're against racism but harder to actually practice it in your daily life.
15522,You can say you're against racism.
15523,"People are honestly tired of being told ""we don't condone racism but you have to understand..."" as part of the reasons why things are the way they are."
15524,"I can guarantee if a landlord said ""no Chinese"" here there would be instant backlash and the government would get in and this race discrimination practice would be shut down."
15525,"Unfortunately, this only affects like a minority of the population so nothing will be done other than the usual platitudes about how racism is bad."
15526,"I don’t believe one family’s benefit should come at a cost of domestic helper’s freedom, and severely underpaying her for the work that she does."
15527,"If these domestic helpers are supposed to play the role of a live-in nurse, then pay her like how you’d pay a nurse."
15528,This is like how we try to justify the awful living conditions of migrant workers with lower labor costs and our prosperity - we cannot be conditioned to think that the only way for families to survive is on underpaid domestic work.
15529,"No, neither is it racist to say that Indians eat a lot of curry."
15530,"What's racist is assuming that eating \_\_\_\_ is somehow an explanation for something unrelated, as if eating \_\_\_\_ defines that race/culture."
15531,"If a white person chimes in with ""I bet's it's because they love to eat rice"", especially if they say it with the intention of **getting other non-Asians to laugh**, that's casual racism."
15532,"No, so I just won’t hire a maid like what I’m doing now."
15533,"No, that is not the point I am making in response to your racist comment accusing them of filming the attack to seek attention."
15534,"No, there are VTL flights on other airlines too, and non-VTL flights on SQ."
15535,"No, these slavers only care about how much they have to pay if anything happens to the maids."
15536,The racial mix and outrage at blatant racism also prevents xenophobia to some extent.
15537,"They're foreign maids, and they choose to come here because conditions in their countries of origin usually suck."
15538,A maid in the past could be flogged legally but that wouldn't even be the bulk of your concerns because as you probably wouldn't even be able to hire a maid back then.
15539,"No, to be honest I'm bothered in how YOUR family treats your maid."
15540,"My maid gets paid 750 a month, has each Sunday and public holiday off, and is treated with respect."
15541,"NS is an implicit tax on a minority of Singaporeans for benefits enjoyed by everyone else (expats, female Singaporeans, new citizens, PR's, etc)."
15542,"I agree we must do more to fight racism, but you need to stop your ageism too, which is a very big problem in Singapore as well."
15543,racism.
15544,"That's not balancing anything, it's taking old racist bullshit and layering new racist bullshit on top of it."
15545,There's nothing much else the maid needs to do next other than cooking lunch and dinner for just the two of them and this is why I don't understand why she is giving us a difficult time.
15546,Because what I said is not about racism but what they actually experienced.
15547,People should learn their mother tongues.
15548,Eye transplant from her to the maid would be more commensurate.
15549,If you employ a domestic helper they are only allowed to work for you and on specific domestic responsibilities.
15550,&#x200B;  The west shall fall because of it's secularism and the immigrants are one of the ways that is on-going.
15551,Primary reason is because their employment passes have expired and govt is restricting renewals
15552,"Putting aside the racist connotations of the term ‘bangla’, this narrative is pushed by people who view them as a monolith, to justify the exploitation and demonization of this social group."
15553,The clearly racist or xenophobic sentiments here on r/sg have been quite blatant for as long as I can remember.
15554,The comments are usually accompanied by all sorts of twisty mental stretches and justifications about how it's all not *really* racist/xenophobic.
15555,"The cost of levies, training, housing, recruitment are additional costs of foreign workers"
15556,But just because there is racism in Singapore doesn't mean every single report of it is legit right?
15557,And just because I say racism doesn't apply in the city harvest case doesn't mean I am implying that there is no racism in Singapore.
15558,If you fight for racism then you should be offended by people playing the race card as a third party when they can't substantiate it.
15559,Wah nowadays people are throwing the word racist at everything.
15560,The current systems in place simply are optimised for foreign workers.
15561,Nobody coming out to give anecdotes on how their minority friends made some casual racist remarks last time.
15562,"Nobody has to open up to everyone, they can just pick and choose through VTL or similar agreements."
15563,Nobody is downplaying racism.
15564,"If so easy to label everything racism, our society will be screwed."
15565,Nobody is opening any floodgates and I never said Singaporeans totally don’t support foreign workers.
15566,You definitely can’t deny the rampant xenophobia here.
15567,">   >Here's a few more choice words from her   >   >a) Singapore jailed minorities mercilessly - Singapore justice, while harsh, is hardly racist, something that even the system's biggest critics could not accuse it of."
15568,"Just don't draw too much attention to yourself, most if not all xenophobia lies in foreigners misbehaving."
15569,People are saying that our govt fucked up with the revision of CECA and we are paying the price because it exacerbates tribalism when it comes to indian nationals.
15570,Non VTL?
15571,"Non-FDW work permit absolute numbers are actually dropping and have been since 2015, with some year to year fluctuations (note that I specifically mean work-permit)."
15572,"The overall numbers are steady due to the increase in FDW population offsetting that, but they aren't exactly displacing the workforce and I don't think we're talking about them here."
15573,"Non-SC/PR can be on non-VTL flight, but need to apply for approval to enter and that application needs to be done by HR."
15574,Non-VTL can only be used by Singaporeans/PR and people with explicit permission from MOM that’s obtained by their employer
15575,Non-VTL flights are about 1/3rd the price of a VTL flight.
15576,"On top of the VTL flight's inflated cost you also need to do an on-arrival PCR ($125) and 6 ARTs (4 unsupervised - $5 each, 2 supervised - $15 each)."
15577,"Non-VTL flights don't have to do a test on arrival, only an SHN exit PCR test."
15578,"They also said that ultimately, the goal was to do away with VTL and the only differentiation is by vaccination status, just like how the UK and other European countries are doing."
15579,Non-immigrant intent employment or business visa waivers are not uncommon to FTAs.
15580,"For instance, when Singapore and the US signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement, it came with certain non-immigrant intent employment waivers for easier short term transfer of employees to both countries:  >In addition to lowering of tariffs, the agreement also allowed easier movement of citizens from both countries."
15581,People opposed to FTAs overestimate the impact of such non-immigrant intent visas.
15582,Non-immigrant intent visas by definition are for short term and come with clauses such as cannot apply for PR / green card etc.
15583,"With regards to CECA, I'm not surprised to see that intra-company transfer visas make less than 5% of total employment passes due to similar clauses in place."
15584,Normally not a supporter of Mothership content but it does a pretty good job of breaking down CECA legalese in simpler terms here:  https://mothership.sg/2019/11/what-the-heck-is-ceca-should-you-be-angry-at-it-explained/
15585,Non-racist policies can have racist results.
15586,None of that justifies racism and xenophobia.
15587,"Of course there are also structural features that help to perpetuate racism, and of course government policy has a part to play."
15588,Some consider the racial quotas of HDB flats to be disadvantageous to minority races as well (though I wouldn't consider this racism per se).
15589,"I believe you mean no harm, but to say there is no systemic racism in Singapore doesn't seem to comport with the evidence, and frankly is a bit of a slap to the face of the minority races."
15590,"In UK they call them ""au pairs"" and they usually don't live in, but they do exactly the same work SG maids do, and plenty of middle class people (especially with kids) hire them."
15591,It's that their laws don't make it as easy to hire a foreign domestic worker as is in Singapore.
15592,The Chinese are never seriously being racist towards others.
15593,"But most of us don't, and definitely not on a racist level."
15594,You would take it so seriously till you think your whole race is being discriminated is becuz you are... Go and figure out yourself  And there is a difference between elitism and racism.
15595,If you think the army have racism then report to your 2lt
15596,Nope it is illegal to keep the FDW's passport.
15597,But how is that racist not to get a number.
15598,"Nope she didn't say she will oblige, she merely say she has not come cross no single migrant worker who has demanded that ."
15599,"And of course, we know no sane foreign migrant worker will demand that so openly because there will likely be retaliation."
15600,"The court's role is to then decide whether the said charge is proven on the facts - they won't charge the accused with something the prosecution didn't raise, so there is no need to consider whether a charge under s 300(a)  So in this case it is irrelevant whether the court thinks the domestic helper had an intention to cause death (s 300(a)), all that matters is whether the court is satisfied that the domestic helper intended to cause injury that will likely cause death (s 300 (c))."
15601,"Nope, I am saying domestic helpers should be treated like any other worker."
15602,"And you continue to believe that the world is on fire and all maids are subjected to inhumane abuse, when it is obviously not the norm."
15603,"If you have x-ray eyes and spotted maid abuse symptoms, and did nothing, then shame on you."
15604,**United Kingdom**  Brexit already shows just how anti-immigrant a sizeable chunk of the population in the UK are.
15605,"Nope, just responding to an ignorant poster who thinks white people are overpaid and don't actually work because he is xenophobic and racist."
15606,They employ me as consultant and a foreign worker.
15607,"(Workers are not 2nd class people, you better don't abuse McDonald workers)      2) I ignored how poorly domestic helpers are treated (Call police for abuse, so things will improve)       3) Having detractors is bad (Lol)       4) baseless personal attack on my character (That's how low you have sunken)       5) Accuse me of being fine with the current poor treatment of maids (No, it's not fine, call police so we can improve things)       6) All maids are in great peril (Most are fine, a minority are treated wonderfully, and a minority are being abused."
15608,"Nope, still 14 days for VTL."
15609,"Nope, that's me being racist, as /u/daretovincenttan so kindly pointed out."
15610,Pretty good business so far especially during the past year.. people appreciate tech folks who can turn up anytime to install and fix their equipment without bothered by border closures.
15611,No middle income family would be able to afford domestic helper(another reason why the govt refuse to implement min wage)
15612,But yeah #blacklivesmatter #fuckracism #justiceforgeorgefloyd
15613,I am working in IT and have a FDW but my FDW has not traveled for more than a year and I last traveled on Feb 1st week.
15614,I don’t have a maid.
15615,It racist cause it reduces a group of people into a caricature.
15616,It’s still racist.
15617,Just closet racism due to the general way of thinking.
15618,Dont delude yourself that you are not influenced in any way to think that the mentality that you have is not racist as it is influenced.
15619,Nah racism is racism.
15620,I know a few racist HR that complains that the Malay engineers in the aerospace industry make too much and felt the need to throw every Malay resume into the bin and try to hire only Chinese < 85% Malay Engineers making 5 figures>.
15621,The hassle are mostly negligible its just your racist one dimensional ass that dont look it at another angle that think it is.
15622,"But yes, LKY held incredibly racist views."
15623,"Not the Hitler kind of extermination racist, but the Bell Curve eugenics kind of racist."
15624,"Faced a lot of ""I'm not racist but... "" conversations while in Uni."
15625,Nope: https://asiatimes.com/2017/11/retired-army-officer-jailed-beating-indian-maid/
15626,Also ITT: people trying to downplay racism as usual
15627,North England is xenophobic?
15628,I was there earlier this month and am doing 14 days in VTL countries.
15629,It's silly because VTL is a flight-differentiated measure and most of them are cat 2 anyways.
15630,Not 100% of the time but abusing [foreign worker is a thing](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/21/singapore-address-treatment-migrant-workers) and construction worker are not spared from it.
15631,It is just most people don't know about it like they know about maids
15632,Wouldn’t surprise me if doctors had to report abuse in kids in Singapore but I ave no idea about domestic workers.
15633,Nice try racist.
15634,"In that case, my mother tongue is either Hokkien or Teochew."
15635,"Hence she always soils herself and the maid has to help her with changing herself, cleaning up the mess etc."
15636,"But because my grandmother is headstrong and stubborn and most likely - in denial about her condition, she scolds the maid terrible things every day, which I can only attribute to her feeling helpless or degraded by her condition and hence taking it out on someone who cannot lash out back at her."
15637,"Experienced extreme racism (violent, property damage)."
15638,"There's a reason expats take their children back abroad after a while, SG is just way too safe."
15639,Not a Singaporean myself but gf is and when I first heard what maids got paid there I was astonished.
15640,Not a domestic helper but my relatives in Indonesia also leach from us.
15641,"Though, what's with the focus on maids."
15642,"What about maids that creates troubles, or a maid that loves to whip out the MOM booklet immediately and play with rights aka ""this is my rights, i cannot do this, you cannot force me to, MOM say cannot"" kind of person?"
15643,"Don't forget, some maids are troublemakers."
15644,There are good maids and bad maids.
15645,"I do not have a maid in my life, but I have heard plenty of horror stories from friends and colleagues on a regular basis."
15646,Isn't racism racism?
15647,"People are here sharing their experiences, there's no need to play victim hierarchy games and reply with your own anti white racism"
15648,Not a single migrant worker had demanded her to be clean though.
15649,"Not a very balanced article, there's really no counter argument as to why Singapore should reconsider - other than ""we want what we want""  This isn't discrimination in any way either, it's actually a step towards equality between all expats who wish to live here."
15650,You can potentially obtain an employment pass.
15651,"We all know people who say racist shit but then hid behind ""Just kidding lah bro, don't make such a black face lololol""  What do you think would happen if I wanted to raise this issue?"
15652,Not all Singaporeans are xenophobic.
15653,In fact most don't so this can't justify all the racist housing ads.
15654,These are the ones your FW and Indian expats are eating up.
15655,Not allowing your maid wifi access is pretty bad.
15656,"Not an expats, but what you said reflects what I hear from my expats colleagues as well."
15657,"Naturally they are concerned about their jobs, but understand that such policies do not come with xenophobic or populist intent."
15658,"Not answering OP's question but I realized this thread is easily the solution to spread awareness about minorities and racism in general in a civilised way, and also answers Mr Pritam Singh's questions in his FB post."
15659,"The issue is about immigrants entering the working class labour force, eg office jobs or jobs with salaries in the middle of the spectrum."
15660,The issue is not about the low skilled immigrants.
15661,"Even if victim is throwing a fit and unfairly accusing the PA of being racist, right thing to do is to de-escalate by committing to meeting the victim and engage her concerns meaningfully."
15662,Not by the trainees but by locals that have similar qualifications as the expats.
15663,"Not condoning ill treatment of maids, but this is why I think it happens:  1) When we pay for something, we expect the service to be flawlessly rendered."
15664,2) We're paying for the maid.
15665,Not condoning racism especially this is the case of Chinese(in a position of majority).
15666,"Nevertheless, this is an act of racism that we Singaporeans should stand out."
15667,Just across the causeway migrant workers there don't even have an id.
15668,"In Singapore, migrant workers here are quite assured of their pay."
15669,I understand that certain roles require FTs (tech etc) but the main issues is the roles in the FO (or even BO)  that can be done by locals are being done by foreign workers that are hired unfairly.
15670,This in turn makes xenophobia rise.
15671,Not every joke that hinges on a stereotype is racist.
15672,Not every maid dates a worker.
15673,"You, better don't lie and generalize that all maids do."
15674,Not talk about racism?
15675,I want to stand up for them if anyone is racist against them.
15676,Not exactly - to make VTL possible both country need to  offer up a verifiable record system.
15677,Not exactly an Aussie expat but I did stay in Australia for 4+ years and moved to Singapore just before the pandemic.
15678,"Not exactly racism, but there are preferences regarding nationality."
15679,"Malaysians (especially younger or “less-experienced” ones) can get employment passes even if their declared salary is significantly under the official minimum required for an EP, while an Indian, Chinese or perhaps Burmese national would have to earn beyond the limit to qualify."
15680,I am not saying we should start increasing the salary of our foreign workers.
15681,I think we need to understand that these people probably have real grievances that have festered over time to create this cesspool of xenophobia and racism.
15682,People get really angry over bread and butter issues and many of these rabid folks probably lost their jobs and attribute it to CECA (we know that many companies have unethical hiring practices which prioritises foreigners over locals).
15683,did not negotiate CECA well.
15684,"Incoming VTL is for biz travel, expatriates and others with family overseas to return after visiting family etc."
15685,However is it really to the extreme of racism?
15686,"If everything is racist and sexist, it becomes normalized and even the most egregious, actually racist and sexist actions become just 1 in a sea of many."
15687,If they want to then fair play but this seem toxic from both sides particularly when she shows her texts from her previous maid.
15688,This is the desperate helpless migrant worker version of the desperate helpless NSF situation.
15689,"Just make it so that any transfer of maid during first 12 months, the costs are pro-rated."
15690,"But nowadays, since the locals want an ""All in one package"", they cant differentiate between a caregiver, nurse or maid."
15691,"Its basically all rolled into one, but at the ""maid"" rate."
15692,"Not hiring someone based on race is racist, or not allowing them into a school, or into a store."
15693,Any man that tries to argue that a woman is racist because she doesn't want to fuck him is an absolute pig and should be jailed if he ever harassed her about it.
15694,Acknowledging racism is not promoting racism.
15695,"Just my two cents, there is a lot of prejudice and racism here that most won't admit which seperates many communities from 'locals'"
15696,"Not just Singapore, Hong Kong and UAE countries are notorious for their treatment of maids."
15697,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but maids are able to choose their employers right?"
15698,Not just VTL flights.
15699,My non-VTL flights from MY to SG was also moved to another day so I had to call for a refund.
15700,"Not just expats, locals too"
15701,We don't need monolingual immigrants that stick to their own kind.
15702,"Not just migrant workers, but our defence, transport, national development, manpower and even healthcare (to a lesser extent) expenditures would skyrocket if we actually paid the relevant workers in those fields their fair share."
15703,Not just on the topic of how one treat their maids.
15704,"Makes you question the effectiveness of the police officers who investigated this case, and the integrity of the first judge who sentenced the maid in the first place."
15705,Singaporeans should be more kapo and report any suspected ill treatment of domestic workers.
15706,This I find ridiculous and racist as us Malays and Other ethnics have the least of the least chances and the number per ethnic group is ridiculously biased and racist.
15707,Or is this just a matter of racism?
15708,The older population grew up in a different time where racism was not the biggest issue they were facing.
15709,Not much negative racisms here towards expats from what I observe.
15710,"Not much racism towards white people, depending on which intake you go in."
15711,Not mutually exclusive to have a significant historical figure with a chequered view of things   Isn't the BLM movement in the UK now howling about how Winston Churchill was racist and splashing paint on his statue?
15712,Without him there wouldn't be any racism in the UK because the Nazis would have ensured there would be no other races except whites
15713,Not my experience but copypasting a past comment I made on one instance of systemic racism   Exclusion of Malays from the SAF/National Service.
15714,"I'd think most people know what racist and xenophobic comments are well enough not to air them in public company, and that the majority of people tend to make friends with or associate with other people that share the same views of them."
15715,"Someone who's strongly racist or xenophobic might know a lot of other people who are and be close to them, someone else who doesn't befriend or get close to people who are racist and xenophobic won't."
15716,"That said, I wasn't saying in my post that most Singaporeans are racist or anything to that effect."
15717,"Rather, I meant to say that most people who actually are would be likely to agree that they don't want racists and xenophobes here either, but at the same time not perceive what they're saying to be that, even though it is."
15718,KLM 0833 is a VTL flight that goes AMS - SIN - KUL so can't all be following SG protocols I guess.
15719,"Not necessarily, you can be in Singapore or in any of the VTL countries for 14 days, not just the one country."
15720,There are VTL flights transitting in Frankfurt.
15721,Except one is VTL and one is non-VTL.
15722,"For example, flights from Paris-Sin on SQ are VTL on Mon, Wed, Fri and non-VTL on other days (random days given as example)"
15723,Not once did anyone of those migrant workers demanded for an apology.
15724,Not one foreign worker has yet to demand apologies!.
15725,I'm highlighting Chinese required isn't racism.
15726,"Not only that, but the police, prosecutors and district judge believed just about everything the rich and powerful family said while ignoring the poor, lowly maid who didn’t speak English."
15727,This is honestly *intensely* racist.
15728,If you are brown color they will think you are those cleaner maids or workers and straight treat you like shit.
15729,"Technically their FDW is ""managing"" their real estate portfolio"
15730,Not possible if the majority of the spread is in migrant worker dorms.
15731,Not possible only if your mother tongue is U.
15732,"Not racist though, they just don’t care about them enough."
15733,Don’t know why racism is thrown around so frequently these days.
15734,Not racist unless it happens to you?
15735,"Not racist, but stereotypes."
15736,"Not racist/homophobic or hateful, but remember Andy's dad who gambled on Germany for the 2014 World Cup?"
15737,Not really a racist one here but kind of interesting:  PART XIII GENERAL PROVISIONS  152.
15738,"Older age group had no prioritisation while for dormitory folks, they were prioritised even over the citizens."
15739,"So within this framework, expats still got free vaccination except for being delayed by 3 weeks."
15740,Suddenly one of them came up to me and said “Do you have the Ching Chong Ling Long?” In the stereotypical racist Chinese accent.
15741,Side note: was insanely tempted to see how far I could shove my boot up his arsehole cos that’s really racist and disrespectful like why tf would u ever say that in a place full of Chinese ppl istg if it was someone else he would have gotten straight smacked to the face
15742,Not really racism per se.
15743,Not really something directly racist...   What stereotypes do other races have of Singaporean Chinese?
15744,Not really understand why we are so anti foreign talents.
15745,"Check out the URA site (google it alongside 'rental prices' or similar) - that is the Urban Redevelopment Authority and they report the actual transaction prices for units by development, number of bedrooms and sq ft. PropertyGuru will have some that are marked up (agent trying to hook in people with more budget/expat package), some near the right price and some lowballed (agent fishing for clients who then get bait-and-switch tactics employed for costlier units)."
15746,"Anti-SJW 'gaming' culture was, and still is a pipeline to the alt-right, or at the very least all kinds of thinly veiled sexism, homophobia, and racism all based on and revolving around this mythical, blue-haired hysterical 'SJW'."
15747,Asians will also experience racism overseas.
15748,A Malay / Indian person tend to be less racist towards someone from the Chinese majority.
15749,"In western Europe, being a racist is a social stigma, and we are used to consciously think that we should avoid that (at least, among the younger university-educated people I know)."
15750,"In Singapore, such awareness is lower, thus latent racism is more prevalent."
15751,"Singapore is a nice place but it does have its problem when it comes to this sort of silent, passive racism."
15752,And I wouldn't rate the stuff I see in Singapore as overly bad racist at all.
15753,"Sure, it's generally hard to apply for PR status in Singapore, but many expats simply aren't interested in permanent residency."
15754,Same goes for Singaporean expats in other countries.
15755,The guy shouldn’t be having an affair with his maid in the first place.
15756,Not saying taking the Driving Center's structured course will be any better in giving non-racist instructors statistically.
15757,"Not saying that Singapore should blindly emulate other country's immigration policy or border control measures, but Japan has blanket-banned everyone who isn't a Japanese national or possessing a Japanese passport for the longest time."
15758,"Not saying there's no xenophobia, but to your first question it matters because whether our local system, education and climate is able to produce (not just attract) world beating talent (like the current DBS CEO) matters."
15759,People who want to scream they’re racist are going to scream that regardless.
15760,"Not saying they're all bad, but I've encountered more than enough terrible FDWs (lying, stealing, bringing banglas home to bang, *actually running a prostitution side gig using the master bedroom when the owners are out*, etc) to be able to understand the need for employers to be able to fire or replace if they happen to end up with a bad one."
15761,"Not saying this way of thinking is right but I think the general view here is that   In case of the viral video - your life your rules (racist to dictate how ***others*** should date just cos of their race)  In case of rental/personal dating preferences - my life my rules (I own the property/I am attracted to only x race, it is not racist to express what ***I*** personally want)  Side note, take a break from reddit man."
15762,So it does not necessarily mean racism.
15763,"Specific as in you claim food is bad, which food to which dormitory to which group of people are bad."
15764,Not seeing any info on VTL flights back to SG beyond 20something March 2022.
15765,"If HK is shuts out, EU VTL is probably doomed because there’s a frequent travel from HK to larger EU."
15766,"Not shooting you, but if that’s the case then idk why the same measures still apply to land VTL…"
15767,Seems to be popular with Korean expats and has good reviews.
15768,"Not sure about Malaysians but I was just saying that even if migrant workers rent rooms, there isn't anything anyone can really do."
15769,"Not sure about that, they kind contempt racism in media, but since greater part of the society is close-minded then what do?"
15770,"Not sure about the locals but having come from India myself and my wife being close with few Indian maids here, Indian employers are the absolute worst scum."
15771,7 out of 10 treat their maids like shit.
15772,"Some ask them to wash clothes with hands even with a working washing machine, ask maids to shave their legs, asking them to massage them etc."
15773,"This is slavery, having to stay in your workplace for 24 hours with no fixed breaks or rest timing is nothing but slavery... it doesn’t matter whether maids come willingly or not... Singapore enables this systematic exploitation by allowing for such dirt salaries... For technologically advanced country this behaviour goes to show humans are same everywhere."
15774,Not sure about the qualification of maid in question but there are options where maids are trained as to take care of elderly.
15775,Please treat maid as human being.
15776,"Firstly, I have a relative who owns a maid agency firm, liaising and providing people who are looking for maid etc."
15777,"In the midst of transferring, the maid will be place at my place, before transferring to other household or waiting to be send back home."
15778,"Recently, the maid place at my house was actually rejected/dismissed by her previous household due to the fact that she had borrowed money online or probably some illegal platforms."
15779,Do understand that those maid had often sacrifice their freedom and work here.
15780,"Edit: Just checked with my mum and I was told that the maid had borrowed money to send back Indonesia, for renovation."
15781,"No subsidies here but for FDW, the Employer need to provide accommodation, food, toiletries, etc and a flight ticket back to home (after the contract)."
15782,"Not sure if anyone is reading between the lines, but this VTL is clearly more for German tourists to visit Singapore than it is for Singaporean tourists to visit Germany."
15783,"He basically confirms that the movie reinforces racist's stereotypes and that's fine because, hey it's comedy."
15784,"Although it is not fake video, it does inch towards encouraging bad or mistreatment of migrant workers which could stir up feelings."
15785,"Not sure if migrant workers, or prison inmates."
15786,"Not sure if this is considered a migrant worker, but i know and occasionally visit a chinese stall owner (She’s from China, I’m phrasing it badly) at Bugis Street."
15787,"Planning to buy her some food and visit her again soon, but i’m a bit shy  Just wanted to share her story to remind everyone to spread a bit of kindness where they can, especially to the foreign workers during this period because they’re having a worse time as compared to the rest of us tbh"
15788,"If the difference in salary between locals and expat is 6k, you think anyone with a functioning brain would prefer to hire the cheaper local if they have the same skillsets and can bring in the same amount of profits."
15789,The fact that you admit there is a talent crunch that's your answer there why we need those foreigners and the only real problem they being here are an eye sore to racist xenophobe
15790,"It doesn’t automatically make you a racist, although you could still be one."
15791,Not sure if you're clueless or really delusional  The dormitory issue was definitely one of the factor that caused PAP to lose a GRC.
15792,You think he is racist?
15793,"If the constant stream of racist, xenophobia, CECA, Indians having issues renting room post on r/sg haven't clue you in on that, you need to climb out from under that rock of yours if you think things have changed from 10 years ago"
15794,"Also, on the topic of racism, did you just generalizing Caucasian as redneck?"
15795,which means the balance is undocumented in the CMIO breakdown?
15796,"The main thing we do in comment sections is lock threads that have devolved into name calling, racism, and other unhelpful behaviour that has nothing to do with the post."
15797,But yeah it is also kinda racist.
15798,"Yes, CECA has benefited sg."
15799,"When it comes to CECA, there is a dire lack of numbers to support the benefits beyond GLCs."
15800,"The migrant workers (and us to an extent) are the ones feeling the consequences, our leaders arent."
15801,"Maybe youre saying that we treated migrant workers really poorly and we are facing the consequences now, butWE arent facing the consequences with the re-emergence of cases."
15802,"Lot of expats from well paying countries go because the company sends them, they climb corporate ladder when they get back home, and they experience Asia - travel around with family etc."
15803,"Then a bunch of British came with their guns, wow what a great place to profit, and made some shady deal, declaring whoever they wanted as as Sultan, and set up shop, bringing in immigrants from all over and essentially destroying their way of life."
15804,Not sure why FDW portion is noteworthy
15805,Not sure why we even differentiate VTL and non-VTL flights for SQ direct routes from VTL approved countries.
15806,We should be just mandating vaccinated only flights on SQ in line with our current VDM instead since basically everyone will qualify for VTL now?
15807,What's the difference between a fully vaccinated individual on a non VTL flight who takes the same number of tests to enter Singapore from one who takes a VTL flight aside from the fact that the traveller on the non VTL flight may have been sitting next to a non-vaccinated individual.
15808,Not sure why you're so adamant on being called an expat?
15809,"Not sure, if Bangkok and Ho Chi Min City keep growing half of the expats not in need to go to the office is gonna say goodbye very easily (I am an expat and all my foreign coworkers are considering taking up to 6 months remote work outside the country)."
15810,Some might also be concerned that the maid will bring the bf back when they aren't in.
15811,"Not that I condone any of this abuse but — for what it's worth — remember that maids, unlike most salaried employees, live on premises with their employers."
15812,"Not that I doubt you, but most xenophobes/racist claim ""reason"" as well... therein lies the problem."
15813,"Not that I'm defending VTLs so late in the game, it's so pointless at this stage.. but that's not the logic used."
15814,"And that's what VTL was for, to regulate that number."
15815,Cos he smelly = not racist.
15816,Cos Indians smelly = racist  Why you call him stupid?
15817,Cos he stole my eraser = not racist.
15818,Cos all Malay stupid = racist.
15819,All I said is that the VTL is useless for some segments of the population as kids are singled out.
15820,"Not that i agree with these racists fucks, but SJW whining is becoming a thing here, i neither want those racists or these SJWs, the ones in the US are just as bad as the people they dislike."
15821,"Not that nursing home is expensive , it’s hiring a maid is too cheap"
15822,"Not the first time I hear this kind of story, as a foreigner, I want to know why people like these couple like to torture their domestic helper / maid?"
15823,"AGC is still an arm of the government, perhaps there are political considerations relating to foreign workers, or maybe some specific case considerations that were not disclosed."
15824,Not the majority lecturing the minorities what is racism 💀💀
15825,"all require pre departure PCR regardless of your flight designation, they alrdy check VTP and vax status for VTL flights, so why not just implement this across all flights?"
15826,One of the rising maid abuse case in Singapore is unfair confinement.
15827,Just like it would be racist if he prefers his colleague to be Chinese instead of another race.
15828,Not the same expats moving back ofc.
15829,"The need to build up local skill competency is obvious, and I do believe that locals can learn from expats as well."
15830,New expats bringing in new knowledge.
15831,Not their first time round the racist scandal tree.
15832,Not to be insensitive but why is that racist?
15833,We definitely can improve the migrant worker's food though imo.
15834,"Not to derail your really well written comment but Chinese Singaporeans do get asked whether whether they're from China a lot if they have a non-dialect surname, or if they look ""PRC"" for whatever reason, because Singaporans love trying to find out if you're ""really"" Singaporean or if you're an immigrant."
15835,"In addition to racism, xenophobia is something we need to work on as well."
15836,Not to mention this is technically government sanctioned exploitation of foreign workers to do low-wage jobs - you deserve less for the same job since you're not Singaporean.
15837,Are you a local LGBT who did NS without declaring or another foreign talent?
15838,So it’s confusing to me why that was even used to disprove racism in policing in America.
15839,"I do wonder if it took so long for NSmen and NSF to be better treated, how long would it take for foreign workers."
15840,Are you sure your flight is VTL in the first place?
15841,There are only few (like2) designated flight number and time that is for sure VTL
15842,"In the UK, even illegal immigrant can walk into a vaccination center and get vaccinated."
15843,"In many African cities for example, lots of money means the expats lives in a heavily guarded compounds, only leaving for work with the risk of kidnapping or worse."
15844,Around the same what maids get here.
15845,"Not trying to detract what you are saying here, but I read that some left cuz it was a dying group and joined other racist groups afterwards."
15846,"Just noting that out of the ones that do murder, [some can be pretty damn nuts](http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/maid-killed-grandma-win-employers-favour)."
15847,But theres a 90% chance the racist dude is from the engineering department.
15848,But I firmly believe that if the maid decides not to stay then there's little point in coercing her to do so.
15849,"I also agree that FDW employment contracts take a lot of time, money and effort to materialise, but it is  1."
15850,"Sufficiently informed by mainstream news that errant FDWs exist  In other words, **hiring a FDW is a risk** \- and embarking on that contract is accepting *caveat emptor*."
15851,But it's a risk that you take when you signed up for a maid though.
15852,There was a japanese youtuber who praised us for treating foreign workers better than the japanese.
15853,Not wanting huge numbers of immigrants in your country =/= xenophobia.
15854,Don't have maids the right to a separate bedroom?
15855,"Not wrong what Kappa ( Joking ah mods , Don't ban my ass or else i'll call you a racist , Joking also )"
15856,Not xenophobia in this context of asking if someone has a bigger stake or a smaller stake in the long term future of a place.
15857,"Note that not all Singapore Airlines flights are VTL flights, you can find the exact list of VTL designated flights here https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/vaccinated-travel-lanes/#Designated-Vaccinated-Travel-Lane-Flights"
15858,"People here seem to think such comments are the exceptions to the norm, but they are far more common than the non-racists."
15859,"Tried to explain to her what's wrong with the whole issue and she just brushed me off saying I haven't had enough exposure, the reason why racist perceptions exist is because all those are really true."
15860,Not when the stakeholders (employers of FDWs) form a sizeable chunk of the voting population.
15861,Nothing racist but they really really shouldn’t have said that.
15862,Nothing to do with racism.
15863,"Even though there is both positive and discriminating racism in Singapore, 99% of all the pro keyboard warriors Singapore have will never dare looking you in the eyes in real life."
15864,The government may have had successful multi-racial campaigns over the years but it was more “tolerate each other” than “stop being racist/let’s fight for equality”.
15865,"If they could stop people from having babies by telling people to “stop at two” and crippling our population for years, i wonder what we could’ve achieved with a proper racism campaign."
15866,Nothing works more effective than legal action towards the racist perpetrators.
15867,"But, it's not true for blue-collar workers like maids, construction and manual workers."
15868,Nothing wrong with being racists anyway.
15869,The east doesnt seem to care and eastern societies seem to function ok anyway even with their racist tendencies.
15870,Just accept that ur racist bro
15871,"I am a salaried worker as well, I work to earn for a living, same goes for the maid."
15872,"But if the maid is that kind of person, being extremely calculative, (like my post example) or are troublemakers,  what do you expect?"
15873,"What about maids that, like recently, dips a baby's hands into boiling water?"
15874,Or the maid that beat the child up?
15875,"Am i supposed to (if I am the employer / victim of those maids) be all understanding and say, ""it's ok, no worries I understand your stressful situation, I understand okie?"""
15876,Now I know racism against Chinese is not racism while supposed Chinese racism against Malay is definitely racism.
15877,"Now I'm wondering how many maid ""suicides"" are actually escapes gone badly."
15878,"Now new trend, any thing also shout racist."
15879,I think only extremely racist societies would have businesses turning away reasonable paying customers solely based upon their race.
15880,"Now see, we aren't xenophobic to Caucasians."
15881,"We have a special brand of xenophobia, one that involves the mainland Chinese and the Filipinos."
15882,"For others, Malaysians get work related immigration approval pretty easy."
15883,Now the priority is not to help the migrant workers meh?
15884,No reason for the migrant workers to bear the brunt of this right?
15885,"At this point, wouldn't it be super difficult for the dorm operators to liquidate their assets and provide basic necessities for the migrant workers?"
15886,"Now there's clear precedent, hopefully more maids will come fourth to report such abusive behaviour"
15887,"They might be correct to defray serious allegations of racism on their part where from their perspective it was non-malicious ignorance, but why on earth would you double and down and punch down against someone you clearly wronged?"
15888,"Now, make more VTL land available"
15889,"Now, you are being racist by linking sterotypes to race."
15890,"If, you are talking about however jobs listing states ""chinese speaking only"" then you are referring to citizen to citizen racism."
15891,I don’t like racist people.
15892,"In that sense, I cannot agree that Sarah lumping everything together still absolves her from the racism comment, because there are no further modifiers with regard to that comment - you can take it at face value."
15893,"They said that she  >""shared claims"" that the incident ""perpetuate\[s\] the racist culture""  It would be the same for people sharing fake news on say, WhatsApp."
15894,OK it's either about race or xenophobia.
15895,"OK, but consider the fact that many expats are probably buying a home in their home country."
15896,OK. All the indon and Filipina maids can record more tik toks with their bfs.
15897,Still not convinced it's an act of racism.
15898,"OKAY OKAY FINE i admit, i write people like you in my essays as an example of xenophobia in singapore, thanks for the great example!"
15899,Fortunately my SQ33 flight is indeed a VTL flight!
15900,How do they not realise it’s racist when you assume someone would not want to interact with someone because of RACE.
15901,The problem is not CECA.
15902,"Can push dog around in pram and feed the dog human food with a spoon at a coffee shop while the dog sits on the coffeeshop chair (I disagree with this for health and hygiene purposes but I know some people will disagree with me), wipes the dog mouth with tissue after every spoon......and the human maid gets nothing."
15903,"Is hitting the expat lottery pretty much the only way for an American to get in there, or are there other methods I might be missing?"
15904,I remember posting a comment a couple of days ago on banning/quarantine incoming flights from China and facing a backlash from the community here despite stating nothing xenophobic/racist.
15905,"He doesn't even know bringing in helper can cost 3k+2k, and even if employer can't ask for the 2k covid fee back they are entitled to ask for some of the 3k agency fees back : https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/employers-maid-agencies-welcome-measures-say-devil-details  50% of 3k agency fees + salary in lieu of notice can easily make 2k."
15906,"OP did not suggest anything that warrant your accusation of him/her as being a ""racist troll"""
15907,Try this website: http://sat.mom.gov.sg/satservlet  to check eligibility for employment pass.
15908,That's outright rejection and hence racist.
15909,"To provide more context on the manpower issue for those outside the industry - with tightened regulations on getting work passes for foreign workers, and covid restrictions on bringing them into the country, it is extremely difficult  to increase staffing."
15910,Shes adapted to your way of living and does the household chores better than any other new maid you decide to get after sacking her.
15911,Ive experienced that during my younger years and its so much trouble to explain to the authorities and the maid agency.
15912,"OP is basically saying ""You're racist?"
15913,"Just don't see race and you won't be racist!"""
15914,"OP is talking about immigrants, not PG or MG"
15915,We don't have the full picture here but not many maid agencies are okay with encouraging the employer to break the law.
15916,OP expects his friend to live in luxury after coming here as... A domestic helper.
15917,"But they are entitled to her paying for leaving without notice period, https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/explainer-what-should-employers-do-if-their-maids-want-be-sent-home  Employers are not wholly without rights too,  you know."
15918,OP must be thinking maids need to dig a shithole
15919,"This in itself is a xenophobic statement, not to mention really counter productive."
15920,"The only thing I see coming out of this whole thread is frustration on OP's part because he refuses to think outside of his self-righteous box, and his retreat to a safe, European enclave here where he can bitch about how 'those Singaporeans so blatantly excuse away racism."
15921,Promising transparency and a quality workforce (locals and expats).
15922,"If the maid is in trouble, it will help her."
15923,"The basis of his entire post - that ""there seems to be a certain narrative around some commenters in this sub and even from the health minister himself, that somehow Singaporeans are revealing their xenophobic tendencies when reacting to the outbreak"" is unsubstantiated."
15924,Gan Kim Yong didn't even mention xenophobia; it was Lawrence Wong who mentioned it.
15925,"Even then, the intent was ""to not over-react and succumb to xenophobia"", which is a far cry from ""Singaporeans are revealing their xenophobic tendencies""."
15926,Many of them aren’t exactly about Black Lives Matter but about racism in their own communities.
15927,"From here, I argue that racism is a huge issue in Singapore."
15928,"I have heard many making snide remarks about the minorities general using their behaviours, appearances, etc and then go “don’t get so offended” when they are told to not be so racist."
15929,This applies to Singaporeans generally not caring about racism - why are you accepting it?
15930,">Exclusionary SAP schools do the opposite of reinforcing a mindset to prefer one's own race in children's developmental years, as long as they aren't inclusive, racism will continue to exist in Singapore."
15931,"Most Singaporean’s don’t know that when a minority-race person experiences racism, he/she is usually not able to stand up to it."
15932,"If I call out racism I will be deemed to be a “shit stirrer” who’s playing the race card, and it leaves other majority-race people insecure,  afraid that I am that type who could accuse them next."
15933,Alternatively I will not be believed because we all want to believe that in Singapore all races live in harmony and there is no racism here.
15934,The vast majority of Singaporeans are not at all racist.
15935,But you can say “Low racism doesn’t mean no racism”.
15936,"As a westerner who lived in Singapore, I observed that racism was very matter of fact."
15937,"As a European, you will usually not receive negative effects of racism, but heaven help you if you look like you are Malay (as in, someone from Malaysia who does not look Chinese [who would be Chinese-Malay] or Indian [who I guess would be Tamil or something?])."
15938,"There are many, many educated Singaporeans who know that systematic racism is a problem for the country."
15939,"OP, if you don’t mind sharing, how bad is the xenophobia say in day-to-day life?"
15940,"FYI: I'm an expat who has lived in more than ten different cities (in North America, Australia, and East Asia)."
15941,Will you be willing to agree that there are SOME Indian expats that don’t make the effort to integrate?
15942,As for racism... it's a difficult thing.
15943,"To add on, the people I hope you are angry at for being profound racist are within your own circle because you really have no idea about people which you don't interact with on a day to day basis and generalising everyone under that age group as ""hypocritical cloud chasers"" is not the direction either."
15944,"OP, you might want to post this on Singapore expat forum (Google it)."
15945,You'll need the job before you can get your employment pass.
15946,While you can apply for a personalised employment pass you do require a salary of around S$7500/mo in Canada in order to be eligible.
15947,OP: makes point about how racism against Chinese does not get as much attention.
15948,"u/mrwagga: responds with racist statement about Chinese   Yeah, it's big brain time."
15949,"OT: Technically, unless your parents are from Beijing/Northeast China, it's unlikely your mother tongue is Mandarin."
15950,"When the fires of racist/nationalistic pride are stoked, people tend to think it's unfair treatment against the country."
15951,"I feel this is a little hypocritical, borderline xenophobic and best of all, too kiasi that you end up having a mundane, boring, crippling life."
15952,"Obviously it wasn't a ""pretty good deal"" for that particular FDW, so your assessment might have missed out a few crucial factors."
15953,"If you didn't even start that career 15 years ago, now you can't be a plug and play replacement for that expat you wanted to kick out so bad."
15954,"omnicron is coming in through VTL even with all the test and documentation, and VTL ticket sale for flight and even land travel is now frozen."
15955,"But let's be real la, you think employers will actively look out for their hired migrant workers welfare and safety if nobody was pressing them to do so?"
15956,"Obviously we have a very different view on people, let me just say that there is no snowballs chance in hell you are turning me racist with a reddit comment.."
15957,"And with 4k, you can't even afford a maid."
15958,"Obviously you came from a rich family, since a maid is a given for you."
15959,"I'm telling you, most people in Singapore nowadays don't have maids."
15960,"Odd, given how the Sedition Act and various other legal tools has been used over the years to clamp down on what is perceived as racism."
15961,"Oddities with Italy's enclave microstates:  * If you're intending to travel back from Italy via the VTL, going into the Vatican City will mean you are no longer in a VTL country, and thus mean you will be become ineligible for VTL."
15962,"Odds are that if you're racist, you'd also lack the concept of introspection required to interpret those glares as ones aimed at yourself."
15963,Including racism.
15964,"Lots of tv shows, podcast, YouTubers etc are labeling activity racist when it is either just ignorant or simply addressing race."
15965,People can and do resist information that disproves their racist assumptions.
15966,The best you can do to not be a target of racism in the west is to appear not to be mainland chinese.
15967,"Of course I'm not Indian, my observation is that many third-generation Singaporean Indians and Chinese immigrants still retain the overbearing attitudes in China and India toward the servant underclass."
15968,My contention is that having a term like 'ang mo' that identifies a certain group of people with (no clear malicious intent) by the general populace doesn't necessarily make Singapore a xenophobic society.
15969,"Terms like ""Gweilo"", ""chao ang mo"" or ""ah tiong"" can be considered malicious, but having those terms used by the minority doesn't make Singapore a xenophobic society either."
15970,"I would agree that xenophobia is a rising trend in Singapore society, but those terms are a result of the xenophobic sentiments."
15971,"What are you, the maid's pamperer?"
15972,Then the cost of retaining these expats would far exceed the profits from the rental market.
15973,We can always replace expats but we cannot replace Singaporeans
15974,"In worlds where Singapore is pictured as the utopian society, the snitching culture and the migrant workers conditions caught many by surprise --even when as for you, this is just the same old Singapore."
15975,"Which is why it gets soldiers of fortune, not immigrants."
15976,It’s not like work permit holder or FDWs ever make it into Singapore’s community.
15977,Even where there's in-your-face racism you think there shouldn't be legal mechanisms in place to deal with such?
15978,Of course it's never the maid's fault.
15979,I hope the next hardworking foreign worker (responsible for building Singapore) who dies in a horrible crash takes comfort in knowing he went in a peaceful less painful way.
15980,No consequences if the racism is against the right group
15981,"Of course not,otherwise ppl say I am xenophobic /s"
15982,So saying they promote elitism and racism is flaw.
15983,My best friend is Chinese and we always have open convo about racism in Singapore.
15984,Of course there is racism but nobody in the right mind expresses it into action.
15985,Do they represent widespread racism and hate?
15986,"China is a superpower, and lets not forget, we have Chinese migrant workers who live in dormitories too."
15987,Singapore is already doing an exceptional job at taking care of the foreign workers wellbeing.
15988,Of course they do but the point is that racism is most experienced by minorities.
15989,"If one thinks racism exists in America they don't ask white people if they've experienced racism, they ask black or Asian people about it."
15990,And in this story isn't the immigrant the entitled one that expects to be able to go into a sovereign nation and be hired over a citizen of that nation?
15991,Isn't 40% of Singepore residents being an immigrant enough?
15992,"but we do not stop there, we also vacc senior expats to maids to massage aunties to construction workers !!"
15993,"The point isn't whether the scenario is real or fake, the point is to discuss what is actual racism and what is not."
15994,"Likewise, I know several males for real that told me they have a preference for western blonde girls, does that also mean they are racist?"
15995,But is victimising the landlords and calling them racists simply for having preferences the proper solution?
15996,Instead of pointing fingers at each other for being racist every time someone gets the short end of the stick
15997,Any legislation that makes it harder for people to be racist is always a + in my books.
15998,That is true for Singaporean expats overseas as well.
15999,All expats are the same.
16000,That's as anti-racist as they come...
16001,Ofcourse racial slurs/insults should be condemned as with all racist remarks.
16002,"Off tangent, but:  Studied in London - rarely saw anyone racist towards Indians, not saying it didn't happen, but I don't remember my Indian or Pakistani friends having major racism issues."
16003,"I want to hope it won’t get passed down, but I’m still naive about my own racism to teach others about it & I also see many other people my age doing the things OP describe…"
16004,Too many wannabe angmohs who take pride in having zero mother tongue ability.
16005,This maid system was definitely shock to me when I first moved to Singapore.
16006,"Oh and, the space allocated to maids in many units is smaller than a linen closet."
16007,"Oh I need to clarify ""foreign workers employed in that place""."
16008,Not complaining about the foreign workers shopping there.
16009,"Anyway, my point is still on the pervasive xenophobia of Indian and Bangladeshis that exists in Singapore."
16010,"Anyone, not just maids, can stay with family who didn't travel."
16011,"It's incredibly odd that the news only focused on maids, when the change seems to apply to everyone."
16012,"The rhetoric online has already made it about ""a Malay man being racist to a Chinese"", implying the hypocrisy of a minority that talks about racial discrimination a lot, while at the same time being racist to the majority."
16013,The key bit of info that the Chinese lady is from Mainland China changes the framing entirely: in truth it was xenophobia.
16014,"If u can't fly in via VTL during this period, then the traveller is treated based on the classification category of the country?"
16015,edit: ok basically means no tourists during this period then  edit again: ok I misread basically if u already have a ticket during this time still can enter SG via VTL... Is it just me or all these different lanes super confusing?
16016,I do agree that we should be more accepting of each other but I do want to know when self-deprecating humour or even teasing can cross the line into casual racism.
16017,That’s not to say all of the people in India are useless - that would be racist and narrow minded - but it shows that a lot of people that want to come here wouldn’t add any value at all (in my opinion).
16018,"Oh Singapore is plenty racist, just not always openly."
16019,"Oh damn, I prebooked tickets for Dec, but I'm sure my flights aren't gonna be the ones designated for VTL lol."
16020,"Oh damn, you're an expat didn't know that."
16021,It's not racism the law is trying to stamp out.
16022,It's racist discrimination when it comes to renting property.
16023,It's a very specific and observable extension of someone's racist beliefs.
16024,And a pattern of consistent behaviour will likely persuade the court of probable racist discrimination.
16025,"Don't underestimate how powerful it can be when laws are in place so that people cannot openly practise discriminatory behaviour - it may not alter the attitudes of diehard racists, but I suspect there aren't that many in the first place."
16026,"Laws outlawing racist behaviour influences public perceptions, attitudes."
16027,"Over time, stigma relating to racist behaviour sets in."
16028,Meant to be racist?
16029,"\[Edit\] I did not expect people to actually think I meant the iPhone, I was referring to the bad image that these FDW's give to the rest of their community when they steal from their employers."
16030,"Oh great yet another ""wow look a white expat talking about singapore, I must share this!"""
16031,"So... the country isn't just exploiting migrant workers, it's essentially taking tax revenue from countries across the entire region by undercutting them."
16032,"/s  Nah, [it just means ""white"" these days](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration)."
16033,"Utterly bereft of logic really but I guess it's trendy to parrot ""hur durr racism bad, inclusivity good"" these days."
16034,"(Btw - [1] you can't be RaCiSt to a country [2] yelling ""white supremacy"" is racist in itself lol."
16035,"And I hope your children come to learn that the racist thoughts that you have, though only expressed privately, are not right and learn to unlearn them."
16036,"I'm glad you've found a way to respond to this racism in a way that entertains you, but do you think this might reinforce their racist thinking?"
16037,"She fucked up the Covid-19 situation and has made no attempts to rectify the problem, instead providing useless remarks like how no foreign worker has asked for apologies."
16038,Why wasn’t the maid sent back?
16039,Normally it's the Caucasian expats that actually walk their own dogs in the morning.
16040,My comment was more towards people that are using this issue to promote more animosity under the label of racism.
16041,You can address both but just talking #blm when you didn't say anything about the discrimination that foreign workers faced during cb is just kinda weird
16042,Oh please ya know this isn't to help expats but all Singaporeans under home quarantine.
16043,"Do you think the PAP elite and their cronies who live in Bukit Timah (D10) and Balmoral (D9), Paterson Hill, etc, will allow a foreign worker dormitory to be built there?"
16044,I'm sure the Swiss Ambassador and British High Commissioner will be thrilled that a foreign worker dorm is being built right next to the Swiss and British Clubs!
16045,Don't act like the PAP is any less elitist and racist than the WP because they aren't saints either.
16046,Oh poor little rich expat boy.
16047,Oh right I forgot that non-VTL have SHN paiseh
16048,"You xenophobic just say, don't need to hide in your closet."
16049,Oh sorry turns out the rant was by a Agent of an FDW.
16050,FDW wanted 2 off days per month but Agent think it’s unreasonable and that she is not on a holiday here.
16051,"In the end, the guy will probably go to Australia instead, and will have a story to tell about how xenophobic we are."
16052,Oh this is racist?
16053,But I do try to distract her when she starts on the maid.
16054,Oh won't someone please think of the racist :(  Maybe he shouldn't have been a racist shithead instead?
16055,I kept asking Scoot & Jetstar support teams why there were no VTL flights to Bali despite the March announcements...   Mystery solved 👻
16056,Using existing racism as evidence that fighting discrimination is useless is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read.
16057,"Oh wow the comments, this is xenophobia central."
16058,"(inb4 ""this is not xenophobia to shit on foreigners, it's just Singapore first"")"
16059,So the maid can look for ano employer in sg?
16060,"Oh yea we couldn't attend the one at SAS, but we were wondering if the expat community met up on the actual day as well."
16061,"But it's just racist death threats to ang mohs, so it's ok I guess."
16062,"I was expecting some racist remarks when I went to western countries, but the only one I’ve gotten so far was from *a local that looks like me* (the person at an information desk preemptively told me she can’t speak Chinese before I even opened my mouth...) which was just funny ironic lol."
16063,The west is more open about facing the fact that they’ve got racist issues.
16064,"The weird thing is, I realise we’re only getting the perception that their countries are damm racist because *people actively shame the racists publicly & speak up about it fervently*."
16065,"I have had friends who would ask me if I had any racist thing happen in angmor countries because “that happens a lot right”, and then turn around to complain about filipino maids being public nuisances etc."
16066,"We are no longer in the 60s and a third world country, many western expats would not even have a job had we not been so welcoming."
16067,we can see it’s just a PA being completely clueless about the Malay culture and not entirely racist.
16068,Oh yes because only old ass boomers get to dictate what counts as racism.
16069,"We took lots of inspiration from Sudesna’s wix site, went and did some more field research, and came up with the idea of using illustrations to complement text based translations as many migrant workers still struggle to read the text.."
16070,"Then I agree, racism is a cultural thing."
16071,I know this borders on xenophobia but it was a malay dude who called me out 😂
16072,"India already has us locked in via CECA, MNCs can do inter company transfers and we all know which are the companies that do tech but run foul of their new Fair Consideration Framework discriminatory behaviour."
16073,"Oh, I assumed Ah Neh is a racist term, meant to show disdain?"
16074,The exception for expats would be the Japanese and Korean expat families.
16075,The non-Asian expats with kids typically have at least one helper.
16076,I also feel as though a lot of expats in Singapore come from hyper-active cities where public transportation or ridesharing is a necessity.
16077,"The problem is that this is now so stigmatised that even if you wanted to helpfully going up to an Indian with BO and suggest the use of deodorant, it will appear to be an act of racism."
16078,"As all Singaporeans know, the Singaporean government treats foreigners better than its own citizens, so if you're an expat, you'll be fine."
16079,It's a weird Singaporean thing that perhaps stems from the CMIO categorisation.
16080,I kinda think maid treated better than NSF
16081,But it seems odd to focus on expats - it's not like Singaporeans aren’t feeling the effects of the not-lockdown.
16082,I'm not suggesting that we ignore expats: just questioning putting their opinions FIRST.
16083,"Oh, so Hitler was NOT racist?"
16084,Awesome that overt racism is discouraged and doesn't occur.
16085,The family was willing to go to such lengths to cover up something as small as a maid's complaint.
16086,It just kinda took off with a lot of different views and stuff about racism..
16087,"There was initial accusations of racism which was quickly debunked (because it was 2 different groups of Indians antagonizing and taunting each other), and then it was classed as a xenophobic rage incident."
16088,Other commentators on the saga then referred to the ongoing animosity between SG local Indians and the India Indian expats who were said to have arrived with a condescending caste-based attitude.
16089,Do we not have the moral obligation to improve the working conditions of maids?
16090,Have the government done enough in legislation to protect the rights of the maids and/or improve the conditions of maids?
16091,"I apologise if my post come across as self-righteous but this is how I feel, that the conditions of maids are not well taken care of and more should be done."
16092,But I do want to point out that Section 5 mentions the US refugee admission program and not part of Section 3 which mentions about immigrants and visas.
16093,But entering the country as immigrants does not seem to be discriminated.
16094,no VTL or Non-VTL or RGL or bubble etc.
16095,"Please give us expats, more moneis!"
16096,Oi msians dont bring ur brand of racism here.
16097,Wait got boomer hear you they will demand an end to VTL.
16098,Singapore as a country has pretty much just accepted racism as a norm for housing.
16099,Even in the thread about the lady getting kicked for brisk walking you had upvoted comments asking if she was actually brisk walking... as though that makes a racist attack less serious or is even relevant.
16100,I don't have a problem with domestic helpers making rape accusations (what's with the ad hominem attack anyway?!).
16101,The light punishment for the maid 2.
16102,"The fact that the maid ""had to"" make such an accusation because her employer refused to allow her to return to Indonesia  Part 2 was what I meant when I mentioned an abuse of power."
16103,2- He failed to check on the maid.
16104,2- May not have known the maid is not getting enough to eat.
16105,The maid is a grown up women.
16106,Why didn't the maid just walk out the door on some random day?
16107,"I have met enough Bible thumping maid abusing Christians and hardcore heavily tattooed metalheads who volunteer regularly at homeless shelters, to know that the art you consume does NOT correlate with the kind of person you are, because people are complex."
16108,"Similar treatment is given to domestic helpers too....  And I'm guessing it's due to years of oppression under colonial rules (it's a guess), then now there's an opportunity to ""shit"" downwards and still continue to worship our colonial gods.... And it's also good for business cos suppression helps to drive costs down and increase margins  (The above seems to be the common train of thought when I speak to the boomer or older generation, also I think I am on track to be a taxi uncle or uncle at a kopitiam reading wanbao or something)"
16109,Ok actually those two examples don't seem particularly racist?
16110,"But if we just look at her statement right, is it any different from any famous minority speaking up against racism?"
16111,"There can be an innocuous or even legit reasons why certain stereotypes exist in terms of imagery, and I don't think everything can be or should be attributed to racism."
16112,I guess I'm just wondering why you would bring up the high rate of immigration of Indian immigrants or closing the border to Indian nationals in response to this attack?
16113,"I think your comment suggested that these are the ""real problems"" instead of racism (but do correct me if I misread your comment)."
16114,"I think you would probably agree that regardless of how you feel about the government's actions or failures on those issues, xenophobia and xenophobic attacks would still be wrong."
16115,"So why would immigration policy and border control be the ""real problems"" in relation to a xenophobic attack on an old lady?"
16116,There's no need for additional xenophobic and segregationist policies.
16117,Everyone says it as a statement but people seldom elaborate on WHY we have become xenophobic.
16118,Ok so I take it that you disagree having a racial preference is racist yes?
16119,Didn't know about the employer's responsibility to locate the maid.
16120,"You can say it is racism towards Indians, but Malays or Chinese should not be involved."
16121,Ok the rain why maids (and foreigner workers) are living with their employers is because price of housing in Singapore is so expensive that they would have to had a HUGE salary increase in order to rent even the shittiest of places.
16122,"But on the flip side, a commonly used defense is “I didn’t intend to be racist therefore what I did was not racist”."
16123,"Ok we are having “qualifiers” now  So you are saying , by your words, it’s ok to choose someone based on race  if I am staying there but racist if I am not?"
16124,If you are talking about pure investment properties or on second properties then maybe ~  but let’s not generalise that everyone who has a preference is a racist/sexist/ whatever ist
16125,"If you really just don't like tenants cooking strong smell food, but actually there are indian tenants is some expat that never ever cooks, then don't assume that Indian people all will destory the house by cooking curry la."
16126,Discrimination and racism wrong is wrong even if it benefits your bottom line.
16127,However my point still stands that white collar Indian immigrants are often arrogant.
16128,"I personally don’t mind foreigners as I am not local myself but why don’t you go to a place thats more suited to immigrants and given your situation NA ,which is built by immigrants, might suit you better."
16129,"Ok, I'm xenophobic."
16130,Would you say it's racist for Singapore to reserve the presidential election for a   racial group instead of opening the elections for all races?
16131,"EDIT: not only it's two less PCR tests, I can take any flight (which might be cheaper since people would mass opt-in for the VTL ones)?"
16132,"It's like saying, ""Ok my neighbour treats his maid badly, so it is ok for me to treat my maid badly."""
16133,"Ok, so to clarify:  It's not racist if:  1."
16134,It's based on looks  It's racist if:  2.
16135,"It's based on stereotypes of behavior  So for example, if I know that a Pakistani man from Pakistan is highly likely to be a male chauvinist, I am a racist for not wanting to date a Pakistani man?"
16136,"Like if their room is messy, don't just ask the maid to clean it up."
16137,"Ok, to clarify I am referring to FDW in HK, because of a case whereby a helper did receive her citizenship back in 2008  https://world.time.com/2012/03/29/in-hong-kong-a-setback-for-domestic-worker-rights-2/  (Not sure if it has been overturned though)  To put in context of my original post, (first)the debate on the quality of care & rights of FDWs & Migrant Workers is legitimate, (second)my comment is squarely on my opinion of a foreign publication that seems frequent to press on this issue, please don't conflate the two"
16138,Why is this racist?
16139,"Okay - I won't go into the whole ""how many posters wrote racist/ignorant stuff"" etc."
16140,"Yes, from our side it looks incredulous, the idea that the government here is displaying blanket racism towards black people."
16141,"This is not a professional piece of journalism, this is a reddit rant by someone who feels extremely hurt and angered by their perceived racism."
16142,"I have no personal proof of ""racism"" but I can tell you that people were PISSED OFF over there (and this was in 2019)."
16143,"I can't generalize all the races but that's some of the reason for it but maybe, some landlords are just racist."
16144,"Okay but that's definitely not a restriction on marriages (that's an unfortunate side effect), that's a travel restriction, which many many countries have now in some form or the other."
16145,My post is sharing my pain and suffering and experience with racism.
16146,Those people who say racist things aren't my friends.
16147,"You hit the nail on the head again with  your response by saying it's what I ""perceive"" to be racism."
16148,"Also about the instagram thing, I'm not afraid to say I'm kinda disappointed in my friends because whenever I post or share anything about racism (even my own experience like how the aunty straight up told my gf those things) none of my friends bothered."
16149,"Not gonna lie, but I too have had some super racist ideologies when I was younger and I've unlearned (or at least I think I did my best) most of them."
16150,"Okay let me repeat for you since you seem like you’re really trying - mental illness is not a cause of racism, all it will do is prevent you from hiding it well."
16151,"But make sure to avoid all future racism issues, we will call back only the Chinese."
16152,You said your teacher is racist as fuck and said racist shit to you.
16153,You mentioned that after suffering a racist attack I can walk outside and carry on my life with the majority Chinese ?
16154,So with the majority being Chinese I will magically be immune to said racist attack?
16155,Racism isn’t right and should have no place in our society but that resentment and victim mentality you are displaying here is the direct opposite of what racism awareness is about.
16156,"Just because you are majority race, if you experience any racist episode means fuck you mate, you don’t get it any worse than us minorities."
16157,"Idk what’s more shameless as fuck, low-key racism under the cover of “privilege” or some random internet comment pointing out your interesting attempts at trying to discredit anyone who has experienced racism just because they are from the majority race ?"
16158,Very interesting that you came out for racism awareness to display your low-key racist ramblings.
16159,Those people are racist to every single fuck thing.
16160,Trying to excuse more racism eh?
16161,Okay this is probably a super unpopular observation but it's what popped into my head so here goes: I dont think this is a case of simple racism.
16162,"when you consider everyone of all nationalities as equal members of a community) is an enabling factor for racism, because by refusing to see colour you refuse to see the inequality inacted _because_ of skin colour."
16163,It’s not racism for foreigners (expats) to not be able to buy HDB.
16164,"You can count it xenophobic, but foreigners who are able to migrate here are expected to have a certain degree of financial capability."
16165,He's been getting more racist since it started.
16166,What I’m not convinced about is your argument that many things are currently wrongly described as racist.
16167,"Could you give some examples of statements, actions, or beliefs that have been unfairly characterised as racist?"
16168,I think that expats are mobile and the numbers in absolute terms still look alright.
16169,"So i find this attitude found amongst a lot of racist Chinese, that Singapore is somehow a Chinese nation, to be seriously a crock of crap."
16170,"Okay, this article is about Bengali translations, not Tamil, so the racist dude can't even racist lol."
16171,"2)  What I *thought* (meaning: I could be wrong) your counterpoint to the above point was set out in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/36yeer/nothing_like_homophobia_xenophobia_in_the_name_of/crial7b), specifically:  > The fact that you were brought up in an atheist family does not remove you from the cultural mind-set of your country  I do not understand what you mean by this."
16172,I tried my hand at interpreting it in my [above comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/36yeer/nothing_like_homophobia_xenophobia_in_the_name_of/cribp9w); I sense from [the beginning of your comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/36yeer/nothing_like_homophobia_xenophobia_in_the_name_of/cric4mu) that I didn't interpret it properly.
16173,I think it's xenophobic to ban everyone from China; the epicenter is Wuhan and its surrounding areas.
16174,This racist thing needs to stop.
16175,"People are so paranoid these days, not everything can be considered racist you know."
16176,We need to here both sides of the story before we all can decide whether this is racist or not.
16177,I honestly think the rights and dignity of domestic helpers need to be strengthened.
16178,I think Singaporeans in general are very confused on what constitutes to racism.
16179,I'm totally the closet racist fucktard moron here who doesn't wanna live with other races/nationalities 'cos one person from one country caused me problems so now I'm not gonna rent my place out to them.
16180,Or is it your own thinking    For the past 10 years I have been kept thinking deep about the maid culture.
16181,"I think in about 50 years , people would associate live-in maids with slavery or human rickshaws cos it’s so heartless."
16182,"On FB and on EDMW, such a huge crap load of xenophobia."
16183,Gonna go on a binder an guess it's a question of racism across Asia…
16184,"On a lighter note, my expat friend told me the stall aunties and uncles automatically never add the ""sea hum"" in her laksa unless she asks for it."
16185,"On a post about racism towards minorities, you decide to stake your claim by complaining about someone calling you a racial qualifier that has evolved to become a part of everyday language with little negative connotation."
16186,What if an innocent tourist/expat approach us to ask for directions but because we are too paranoid we avoid them.
16187,If we did away with maids and spent more time at home instead we'd have an economy that looks like eastern Europe.
16188,"On learning OP is married to a local, a moderator on that forum replies with this  >However, the fact that you employ a maid to look after your daughter did signal that the purpose of your wanting LTVPs for you parents was to just get them in the country for long periods of time to abuse the system and the PR you were given."
16189,"**   Really, how xenophobic can we get ?"
16190,"That is what needs to be addressed, not replacing foreign maids and construction workers with Singaporeans."
16191,I have not experienced any racism / stereotype at work directly or blatantly.
16192,"If someone closes their nose and mouth if I sit beside them, I still believe that it’s because I am smelly and it’s not due to racism."
16193,Is there racism in Singapore ?
16194,Subtle racism yes - and it comes from acknowledging it rather than being in denial.
16195,"We are lucky to be here because we have not experienced a direct, racism hate crime unlike in Europe and USA."
16196,"On my way to work (essential sector) and see a large party of elderly still mingling around chatting, small groups of maids sitting in void deck floors chilling, area outside mall still crowded early in the morning and people smoking and spitting on the ground... really?"
16197,On one hand we want to stop relying on low wage foreign workers on the other hand we still want them :X
16198,"On the other hand, vaccination is currently still a zero-sum game - vaccinating more foreign workers would mean vaccinating less Singaporeans - and however necessary vaccinating foreigners over locals may be it’s not gonna sit well with the general population."
16199,"Furthermore, the government may consider the foreign workers to be a low-risk group because many of them had already been previously infected and many of them are relatively young."
16200,"I don’t think I mind donating my jab to a foreign worker and just getting it later, but how many of us would be willing to do that, considering it would probably mean delaying our overall reopening process?"
16201,"On one of the screenshot posts, someone writes this:  > *”Some helpers are already choosy to only look for families that could provide own room…”*  Is there no law that domestic helpers have to be provided their own room?"
16202,On reverse racism:   > There is no such thing a “reverse racism”.
16203,"One thing that I’ve already seen come up is cries of “reverse racism”, or racism against the Chinese who form the majority in Singapore."
16204,Being a minority that is prejudiced against the majority does not make it “reverse racism”.
16205,"Again, “reverse racism” is:    > Reverse racism or reverse discrimination is the concept that affirmative action and similar color-conscious programs for redressing racial inequality are a form of anti-white racism."
16206,[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_racism)  An example would claiming that academic scholarships only given out to minorities are “reverse racism” that seek to disadvantage the ethnic majority.
16207,"> So yes, people from minority races can be prejudiced, and can say things that are racist towards a member of the majority race, but what that member of the majority experiences isn’t “reverse racism”, because we aren’t experiencing an entire system of oppression."
16208,"Again, not what “reverse racism” is."
16209,The actual definition of racism is:   > racism rā′sĭz″əm► n.	The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.
16210,"[Source](https://www.wordnik.com/words/racism)  What she has just described, is systemic racism:   > Institutional racism (also known as systemic racism) is a form of racism that is embedded as normal practice within society or an organisation."
16211,"[1]  > The term ""institutional racism"" was first coined in 1967 by Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton in Black Power: The Politics of Liberation."
16212,"[2] Carmichael and Hamilton wrote that while individual racism is often identifiable because of its overt nature, institutional racism is less perceptible because of its ""less overt, far more subtle"" nature."
16213,"Institutional racism ""originates in the operation of established and respected forces in the society, and thus receives far less public condemnation than [individual racism]""."
16214,[3]  [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism)
16215,"On that note, the negative response to the recent migrant worker issue has also greatly disappointed me."
16216,"An exposé regarding the players' pay and living conditions ([https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/today20-s-league-football-stars-who-take-home-less-maids-june-7-2006](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/today20-s-league-football-stars-who-take-home-less-maids-june-7-2006)) raised an uproar, eventually culminating in coverage of the issue on BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/5079434.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/5079434.stm))."
16217,"On the bright side, the number of community transmitted cases have been decreasing and the dormitory residents are being quarantined."
16218,"Im happy for what these expats have contributed, to my point it truly shouldnt even be that high."
16219,"Since these foreign buddies are so capable, why not  for example go to Philipines or any other countries which requires the expat's prowess & help grow their economy.🤪🤪🤪"
16220,It's rather laughable that they claim it is systemic racism instead with a few thousand worded essay and a historical analysis to boot.
16221,On the employment pass there is a passage.
16222,I agree that service workers deserve greater protection for abuse but the xenophobic framing makes it look less like a sincere attempt to protect them but more an excuse to complain.
16223,"On the other hand, why do Singaporeans feel the need to treat domestic workers as sub-human?"
16224,Like the employers who starved the maid nearly to death.
16225,"On the other hand, if you don't mind a 7 day quarantine at home (though if you intend to visit your father without staying in the same home, this may not be ideal), non-VTL flights can be much cheaper than VTL flights, and restrictions on transit were recently lifted."
16226,On the point as to why is CECA singled out amongst the 26 FTAs.
16227,It wasn't Singaporeans who first had the idea that CECA made Singapore obligated free movement of indians to Singapore.
16228,"First of all, this statement is racist as hell."
16229,Some expat seems to have a sense of moral and status superiority over the locals.
16230,"https://mothership.sg/2019/10/deepavali-angry-condominium-security-guard/  I hope I don't come across being racist, but despite the caste system was abolish in India decades ago, many indians continue to emit differential treatment to people based on their skin colour."
16231,The presentation of the sentiment today is not a simple cause of racism or a deliberate manipulation of a single politicians to go against an entire group of people.
16232,"On the seedy underbelly thing, I think OP is talking about dive bars, tattoo parlours and the like, basically working class areas or immigrant ghettos that might appeal to middle class hipsters?"
16233,"As for the four floors and Geylang, I agree that's a very seedy underbelly but I don't know if OP is interested in watching dirty uncles (Geylang) or sleazy beer bellied expats (four floors) chatting up prostitutes over bad quality beer."
16234,On the topic of exploiting and abusing domestic helpers ... its a cultural thing
16235,"Once VTLs to the middle east start opening up, there will be way cheaper flight routes through there."
16236,"Plus United is selling tickets on their SFO-SIN route starting in January, no way that won't be a VTL flight."
16237,Once again I am amazed by the people who mistreat their maids when that maid could very well slit your throat if she wants to in the dead of night.
16238,"In this case, it was not because of mistreatment, but people who mistreat their maids have bigger balls than I do."
16239,Once again Sinkies serving military is sent to help out to make expats feel better
16240,CECA does not impact immigration and/or promote the employment of Indian workers in Singapore.
16241,"Once my dad was on the phone with a customer service officer and made the remark ""I don't need to specify which race but you already know it.. if you see a snake and an Indian, you kill the Indian first""  After he put down the phone, I told him he shouldn't be saying such things and denying them the opportunity to prove they're just like anyone; (this was around the time preetipls called out racist Chinese people)  He shared with me about how he has encountered multiple Indian customers (he's a grab driver in his free time btw) that made bookings and refused to show up, or they cancel the booking when my dad gets there."
16242,Once my daughter approached a chinese child and the parent started hurling racist abuses at India / Indians and ordered my wife to fetch me.
16243,"Also, this is a much better reference for the answers you're looking for:  https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewforum.php?f=78"
16244,"One day if you're sick, poor and need help, these people treating maids like shit would probably treat you the same."
16245,"I understand this throws things into disarray for families that are dependant on a helper being around 13 days out of every 14, but if that's the case the system doesn't work and we need change that isn't at the expense of our FDWs."
16246,"The same teacher also scolded a Chinese classmate for not handing in his mother tongue homework by saying ""maybe you want to paint yourself black and go learn Tamil instead""."
16247,"One maid I do know (employed by family friend) is pretty chill, and I see no reason why she cannot be treated as part of the family."
16248,"I got pretty disillusioned when I heard someone remark that “no matter how close she (the maid) gets to the family, she still has to know her place”."
16249,I got quite upset cos we’re really good friends with this particular maid and I don’t see what was meant by “knowing her place”.
16250,"One major under the radar change recently was Singapore deciding to get rid of the Dependent Pass ""letter of consent"", meaning that if an expat's spouse wants to work, they now need to qualify against the full EP criteria."
16251,"The catch is that a lot of expat spouses do part-time work (teaching at international schools etc), where both hours and salary are insufficient for EP, and you can't even legally *volunteer* (unpaid!)"
16252,as an expat without a LOC.
16253,"They are racist, they are myopic, they are prejudiced - but they have that same ballot as you do."
16254,One of my former clients had a maid who cried when it was time for her to go back to her own country.
16255,"When I went over, more often than not, the maid would be on her phone to her own family while looking up at the night sky from the garden."
16256,"I guess, if you can treat a maid well, get one if you need one."
16257,"But their next maid cried all day even when they gave her a couple weeks of zero duties, so there's that :p"
16258,"By claiming that racism in Singapore is almost always casual and neither exploits nor mistreats minorities, you have, in a single sentence, both decided how minorities feel *and* absolved the perpatrators of any wrongdoing."
16259,What worries me is that most non-woke people in Singapore would be unable to see racism in the US were it not for the deaths.
16260,"If you strip the violence layer off this ""racism onion"", there are plenty of parallels (race-based quotas, housing discrimination - both dead in the US but alive and well in Singapore)."
16261,"The example of predominantly brown migrant workers, for instance, fulfills both your criteria: blatant mistreatment and blatant exploitation."
16262,"Similarly, if you think denying living space to racial minorities (or charging them higher rent because of the colour of their skin) and cultivating SAP schools in their current form aren't examples of racism or stacked institutional odds, then I fear you have mislearned the lessons of what is happening in the US."
16263,"Hint: it isn't just slavery and cops murdering black males  To be clear, I'm Indian and this shit (racism + BLM solidarity w/o introspection) happens in India as well."
16264,One of the guys I know (non Singaporeans) used to pay their FDW a certain percentage of their own yearly bonus.
16265,One of the key element the maid agreed before coming to SG - They are not allowed to be pregnant.
16266,Just because the agent/landlord prefers Malaysians also does not mean that this isn't racist.
16267,financial background etc) is the textbook definition of racism.
16268,"Last year, my cousin hired a maid to look after his newborn child."
16269,"The maid ended up getting a boyfriend, and my cousin made the mistake of trusting in her and let her be."
16270,"The boyfriend turned out to be a good for nothing and my cousin's maid (possibly unknowingly) ended up borrowing money for him from loan sharks, putting down my cousin's address and details for the loan shark to take down."
16271,"When the boyfriend failed to pay, the maid kept silent about the entire thing and my cousin only found out after the loan sharks came up to his doorstep to seek payment."
16272,It was a frightening ordeal and the maid put his ENTIRE family in danger just because of her stupid boyfriend.
16273,One of the reason we did not hire FDW.
16274,"During those days, I am sure my wife will want FDW to stay, and do house chores, at my in-laws place."
16275,MIL has been gian for FDW for a long long time.
16276,"When our 1st child was born, she even suggested that, we hire a FDW, to stay at her house, help her with house chores, so that she can help us looking after our kid (and she still wanted to run her canteen stall business)."
16277,"One of the weirdest things for me, as an immigrant, was having to pay for caller ID."
16278,"And btw, nowhere did Sarah call PA or the incident racist."
16279,"She mentioned culturally insensitive, but how PA jumped to the extreme (racist), no one knows."
16280,One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers.
16281,I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy.
16282,I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.
16283,One reasoning I heard from an old folk who had a maid is that if he treated her too well she will take advantage of him.
16284,The maid had a hard time.
16285,"One symptom of racism becoming systemic is when the racism (or at least racially problematic aspects) is met with ""aiyah, it's like that one, everywhere also have""."
16286,One thing all racists have in common: they're dumb af.
16287,"One thing for such is, migrant workers didn’t have it easy in the lockdown."
16288,One thing i don't understand is why employers keep the passport of their maids?
16289,"MOM explicitly state that employers should not keep their maids' passports and yet, many people do."
16290,It feels like the maid is being made a prisoner no?
16291,"However, since 2011, the PAP seems to have embraced populism via worship of Lee Kuan Yew following his death, their populist anti-immigrant u-turn and the pioneer package."
16292,"Edit: I went to relook at the Annex for 16 Apr again and there's at least 100 cases involving unlinked work permit holders, yet some of them are still indicated as belonging to a cluster/dorm as per the right-most column of the Annex for 16 Apr."
16293,"Given that they specifically distinguished work permit holders residing outside of dormitories from those living in dormitories for the press release but not in the Annex for 16 Apr, it may be that this statistic of separating work permit holders residing in and outside of dormitories is unrelated to clusters e.g."
16294,Perhaps the distinction made in the 16 Apr press release could be in preparation for further measures that they are going to announce which are specifically linked to dormitories/work permit holders regardless of whether they live in dormitories or not.
16295,"Even though his maid requested him to slide down, he scolded her back."
16296,We have maids when we were young.
16297,I never thought I was racist but that day it was like a switch flipped and I never saw them as the same.
16298,One trait of racism is subscribing to and perpetuating stereotypes.
16299,I think it’s very telling that you’re doing exactly that while supposedly trumpeting how you detest racism in your post.
16300,One way to understand why CECA offers such a lopsided deal to India is to understand why India walked away from the RCEP.
16301,"Unfortunately, in negotiating CECA Singapore doesn't have the negotiating clout of an entire bloc like RCEP and hence had to concede that key point and simply settled for some clauses which allowed some measure of control over immigration."
16302,And even then India could still complained Singapore was exercising its right to restrict immigration too much violated the spirit of CECA.
16303,“They are doing it despite the CECA clearly stating that there will be no ENT or quotas on agreed services.
16304,"One, maids are enjoying their life here, it's markedly better than back home with better pay."
16305,Getting rid of maids is just stupid.
16306,"From young, Gen Xers were left in the care of grandparents, relatives or a maid but in reality they were on their own."
16307,"Others can get their local office to sponsor 60 days, the remaining categories are 2 year employment pass also sponsorship local office."
16308,Only Caucasians get labelled as expats.
16309,"Everyone else gets the ""immigrant"" label."
16310,Only SC/PRs can enter via non-VTL unless they have a special permission for entry that can be only applied for via the employer.
16311,Only VTL affected.
16312,Only decent carrier because the other airlines can't be bothered with this stupid VTL game.
16313,Only got to look through the comments to see how the locals feel about expats.
16314,Only the CECA has the clause on mutual recognition of standards in 4-5 major sectors of the economy to facilitate entry of Indian nationals in these sectors into S’pore.
16315,"===================================================  Since you have a clear understanding , pls let us know as which field in EP/WP form will the candidate under CECA highlight that ""he is applying under CECA""?There is none."
16316,Only the rich can use VTLs.
16317,I remember thinking how great it was when I was 17 and I also lived in Hong Kong for a year and visited HK frequently (my parents lived there for 7 years) so I was familiar with the asian/expat lifestyle.
16318,I wouldn't trust any ratial comments coming from a national whose country is uhhhhhhhhh in a love affair with a very discriminatory and racist far right
16319,"Ooooh the old ""if you point out racism, actually YOUUUU are the one trying to stir racist sh1t!"""
16320,Blaming whistle-blowers and not the actual racists.
16321,"I think the author is right in that case, double standards for maids vs ""professional"" people."
16322,"Op is not an expatriate, but he's also definitely not a local."
16323,Op mentioned people looking down at lower income households in his area - not racist.
16324,Op you seem to be more interested in talking about racism than having your renting questions answered
16325,Op your post is very racist.
16326,"Open VTLs with more countries, what a joke."
16327,"Open up VTL after 3rd booster, then new variant comes, rinse and repeat."
16328,Opposition supporters: eh singapore racist  Also opposition supporters: go back bloody indians
16329,But the proximity of other VTL nations makes me think otherwise.
16330,Or a small maid with boils.
16331,"Or he should have enrolled in a local university so he can have a ""bright future and potential to excel in life"" before recording the maid."
16332,Or how to buy foreign worker boyfriend iphone x?
16333,Or just cancel the VTL flights and you get to enjoy a SHN sua?
16334,Or maybe listen as to why it could be racist instead of not taking notice
16335,Or maybe racism really exists and your hypothesis is false?
16336,Or maybe they are racist land lords?
16337,Not every expat is wealthy or earn a lot.
16338,Or they could just be Singaporeans like you and me born out of naturalized angmoh expats who have been here their whole lives.
16339,Or we should let migrant workers do what they want rather than keep them locked up.
16340,I'm a woman that doesn't think reducing the reliance on live-in maids would make me need to quit my job lol.
16341,"I think it's complicated, and difficult to dismantle our addiction to super low paid live-in maids, but it's not impossible."
16342,"My point is all immigrants (settled, third generation, whatever) have no right to the land they settled in."
16343,"Or you know, we can just stop being so damn chauvinistic and accept foreign workers/immigration."
16344,Immigration and foreign workers is literally the only solution to our problem.
16345,"Orchard road is just a high-cost shopping arcade crowded by the high-paid people, which often comprises of expats from some specific finance like sectors, and lots of tourists ... it is not representative of Singapore demography, is it?"
16346,"That said, isn’t it funny that you’ve already written off genetics as a factor when:  1) there’s almost no in-depth studies done wrt to different race behavioural aspect, nor even different culture behavioural difference with regards to aggression, violence etc  2) we know so little about human genetics + human behavior  The biggest problem I feel is that ANY scientist that even raise genetics as a varying factor for intelligence or negative behavioural traits are immediately chastised or labelled racists."
16347,"However, if I translate it to different races have different testosterone level and hence some races are predominantly more aggressive than another then I’m a racist fucker?"
16348,"Just do it if you want it, don’t go saying you can’t clean a beach because xenophobia1!1!1!."
16349,"Other airlines run VTL flights too though, but maybe not to the same volume perhaps."
16350,Other gems:  >Stereotypes occur because it happens in a pattern  Isn't that the definition of racism ?
16351,The first three books in the series are just a smidgen outdated but they're a great starting point of getting to know the idiosyncrasies of living in Singapore from an expat point of view!
16352,"For the case of 1), the maid e.g FDW can only work at the residential address stated on her work permit."
16353,Ask the MOM enforcement division to come down at the same time where the maid is working in the office.
16354,"http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/employers-guide/employment-rules >For illegally deploying an FDW, the penalty is a fine of up to $10,000."
16355,Convicted employers may also be banned from employing FDWs.
16356,Other than South Korea I believe all our VTLs are unilateral since for the most part the other countries have been open to Singapore.
16357,"As to where SQ flies to, because the rule is that you can pass through other VTL countries before flying back, it would make sense to allow neighboring countries as well (eg I can road trip through France and Germany but not Switzerland, when it should theoretically be ok to allow that as well)"
16358,"I'm aware that racism exists everywhere, and wonderful people can exist in the middle of the most unpleasant of places."
16359,"Which is you, as a PAP IB, are shielded from racism and hate in Singapore, because of your ideology (you believe that the PAP will do what's good for Singapore and will defend that at all costs online), race (presumably Chinese, if you are Malay, Indian or something else, I apologize for assuming it) and thus are less likely to see actual examples of racism because everyone around you share the same thinking."
16360,It's really surprising to find out how racist your relatives can be when an inter-racial relationship comes into play.
16361,"Even if our migrant workers are immune, borders has to be sealed and social distancing procedures needs to be followed, and many Singaporean jobs will be gone."
16362,"We will need to spend a lot of money even if we prepared, or responded to the migrant worker situation early."
16363,Our MoM seem to operate in extremes when it comes to foreign workers vs ep sp.
16364,"Our approach to our maid  - We rented a larger flat so she could have a bedroom - we live in a newish condo and the bunker room is not fit for human living (no window, no air, no AC),  - She leaves Saturday at 5pm and returns Sunday at 9pm - stays with her boyfriend  - We pay for her to fly home twice a year (economy) during holidays  - She has wifi access/facilities access - she can go to the gym or pool in the evenings as long as one of us is around    AND HOW DOES SHE REPAY US?"
16365,Our domestic helper was at Kallang loitering happily in groups of 5.
16366,Money from the expat community is needed to inject cash into the economy.
16367,It makes sense to market ourselves as a great place for expats to live in.
16368,"And by expats, I mean people from western countries, not your foreign construction workers."
16369,Our epicenter is on foreign workers and we alrd have a case of employer locking them up.
16370,I'm going to avoid live in domestic helpers as much as possible - because we simply don't have the right arrangements as we do now to allow them to live in dignity.
16371,Heck even maids in many landed property houses live in the tiniest bedrooms that don't have windows.
16372,Our maid always refuses to eat in restaurants and it stresses me the EF out because I'm scared people might judge us.
16373,Made me learn to not judge people who don't eat with their maids.
16374,Our maid joins us to eat with us.
16375,"local staff and Quarantine Officers)  10 Kian Teck Crescent dormitory,  Changi Lodge II,  2x Administrative staff at North Coast Lodge, Aluana Lodge, Operations staff at Sungei Tengah Lodge,  2x Served Quarantine Orders as QO officer at various dormitories,  2 Sungei Kadut Avenue   **2 contacts of the above**  The other SC/PR cases in the past few days are:  4 contacts of cases that I'm unable to find information on (predates these Annex Cs)  2 people (married couple?)"
16376,"Outside of places like SG and HK, I'd have thought that maid would've carried a fairly classy connotation, like the female equivalent of a butler."
16377,Outward racism is perhaps not comment but microagressions usually stemming from ignorance is very common.
16378,"I'm not sure why it makes such a difference anyway, as if discrimination based on religion, ethnicity or national origin is somehow OK or better than ""racism"", it's all coming from the same place."
16379,This seems like a significant change from the demographics in previous decades where angmohs tended to be highly paid expats on full packages with housing etc.
16380,"A change in immigration policy, etc etc?"
16381,Aren't we able to conduct mass daily testing as has been done for the foreign workers?
16382,"The migrant worker dorm issue is not a covid issue, it's a migrant worker issue."
16383,Overheard a bunch of French/Swiss expats in the MRT a few years back.
16384,Like the perception of foreign talents overruning the high paying jobs in singapore.
16385,Overseas foreign worker
16386,"I guess you are one of those who will call everyone who refuses to date outside of their race, racist."
16387,Indian expats themselves firstly have to acknowledge and condemn the minority (unfortunately I dare say 30-40%) that give all of them a bad name.
16388,Like the Indian Encik in the park who called the expat family out for wearing masks.
16389,"By failing to do so, people really feel there is an institutionalised bias towards expats."
16390,"Singaporeans as a whole, then will have more pressure to acknowledge that “Hey yeah, Expat themselves condemn the barbarians” - we saw this when Chinese PRC immigrants were targeted too."
16391,"If one expat commits a hate crime (IE Ramesh), the government says that its “a minority but most expats are law abiding” - yes, statement is true, but when said Indian Encik calls out expat-BS, “ALL Singaporeans must not be xenophobic/racist.”  What gives?"
16392,"Ultimately, locals are angry at BAD POLICIES, however, we are mistakenly taking out our anger on Indian expats when we should really in fact, be angry at the gov (we are, but we scared)  Indian expats don’t help the situation either when you fail to silence people like Ramesh, call people out with fake degrees."
16393,Ownself say ownself not racist.
16394,"What was worse, the officials who called my dad do not have a definite answer on how to handle cancer relapse patients like him if he were to be sent to a quarantine facility (we have a maid here to take care of the daily basic necessities at home)."
16395,"PA banner up to celebrate Hari Raya, but paste a Malay couple wedding photo without consent and out of context, and they are racist?"
16396,"PA is grievously guilty of misrepresentation/misappropriating a group of people and bad PR, but to say they are racist is also a very strong charge."
16397,Just imagine trying to do something good for the community and being accused of racism.
16398,"Don’t they know how hard it is to contain discussion on social media knowing the outrage and umbrage, and recent discussions of racism."
16399,"More accurately, Lee Hsien Loong's foreign talent policy."
16400,"PAP is pretty centrist and implements policies that the Western left would consider far-right (nationalism, militarism, harsh punishments for illegal immigrants, anti-affirmative action, etc.)"
16401,They also have a liberal immigration policy which they say is necessary but have cost them their usual landslide victory in 2011.
16402,"The more ""fringe"" opposition parties are actually further to the right when it comes to immigration (anyone recall Reform Party's Gilbert Goh's racist remarks?)"
16403,"And when the riot cops showed up even though there were only a dozen of them facing hundreds, or even thousands of foreign workers, they were calm in the face of chaos."
16404,"Especially the one about the opposition, considering the govt did kinda fked up regarding the covid outbreak  And with the recent case about the “racist” remarks it just seems like the pap is being petty (also double standards seeing how the pap made worse statements before)"
16405,Also PAP: Don't let xenophobia take root!
16406,"I’m not denying there’s totally no xenophobia or racism involved, but to paint pushing for accountability as racist simply because foreigners are involved is ridiculous."
16407,"If we are to STFU because we developed a PC culture that tells  us that we cannot be xenophobic and call for enforcement against any foreigners, then *what can we do*?"
16408,We can’t just wave that legitimate concern off just because it *sounds racist*!
16409,It is not necessary xenophobia.
16410,"Compared to some of the poor migrant workers whom we revoked their permits, they are actually *educated enough to read and understand what is allowed and what is definitely not*!"
16411,Is it not fair to expect the government to enforce the same on rich white expats?
16412,It would actually be *racist* if rules apply to poor brown/yellow people but not to rich white ones.
16413,"While it appears to be xenophobic to call for their expulsion, it is in line with the government’s stance against foreigners who broke our rules, which is to revoke their permits and *the government had actually done it before*."
16414,"24 workers had their permits revoked and barred because “The work pass holders were caught eating, drinking and gathering in groups in the vicinity of Tuas View Square, a factory-converted dormitory.” Sounds similar to those expats at Robertson Quay who were also caught (by the public with video evidence) *eating, drinking and gathering in groups*."
16415,"Pedestrians at the junction scolded him and the PMD rider responded,""You all racists is it""."
16416,PMed you - a friend is looking for FDW
16417,Go to any expat forums and they will tell you stories of people with >10 years working in Singapore not being able to get it.
16418,"PR and Citizens  cannot apply for VTP as they dont require an approval to come back in, VTP is ONLY for LTP holders and STV  VTL (Vaccinated Travel Lane) can be used by anyone fully vaccinated, but everyone who isnt PR/Citizen requires a VTP (Vaccinated Travel Pass) which is automatically approved / instant, when applying online and can be done by the travelers themselves (not via Company / HR)"
16419,"PR and Singaporeans can travel in and out of Singapore freely, so why not expats too?"
16420,"PR stunt or not, as long as the migrant workers truly benefit, I have no complaints."
16421,Everyone who doesn’t give them a chance is a racist.
16422,Edit: An 8 year old account suddenly becomes active and starts commenting about racism.
16423,PSP and CECA are the perfect example of toxic couple whose refuse to leave each other.
16424,"Political Development  **Economic Development** |    - Vision : To **raise real wages**, Focus on local SMEs, Balance economic and environmental protection  - Action : Job priorities for locals | quota management for S/E pass/ work permits | wage management 		         - Review CECA 		- Funding/supporting SMEs  		- Balancing foreign labour with better equipment/processes instead 		- Moving to value-add/ higher-wage model 		- Workfare/cash portion to 80% | introduce living wage  *(What I would like to know: Details/numbers on how much ""change"" this will be, compared to the current funding/quota for the proposed actions."
16425,"PSP's manifesto had some rather populist policies on immigration (quota for EP, review quota for SP, review trade agreements like CECA) but their performance wasn't affected that much though."
16426,Pandemic prevention for migrant workers bad.
16427,"Healthcare to infected migrant workers good, very little die."
16428,"Pandering to her voter base, which I am pretty sure don't care about the well-being of migrant workers."
16429,"Para 1, 2  and 3 of Chapter 8 (Movement of Natural Persons) of the [Korea-India FTA](http://commerce.nic.in/trade/INDIA%20KOREA%20CEPA%202009.pdf) is almost **word for word identical** to Chapter 9 (Movement of Natural Persons) in the [CECA](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/Chapter9_Movement_of_Natural_Persons)."
16430,"Paradoxically what I've observed is that the more vulnerable people often do not wear masks properly (cleaners, maids, many low-skilled job workers who could have a lot more interaction with other people)"
16431,"My friend is the one who started BFYB, the group that organises flea sales for these migrant workers."
16432,"It's hard to explain to someone how racism is until they have experienced it themselves, I hope to be able to pass this on to my son."
16433,"One rather awkward aspect of this was also the (over)emphasis on the Malays as agrarian in order to portray them as the original inhabitants displaced by the urban-centric immigrants, ironically perpetuating British colonial stereotypes despite many ""Malays"" actually being quite involved in urban occupations."
16434,"Although one of the consequences may be an increase in taxes, but it shouldn't be more than what one would already pay for a maid."
16435,"Later, I was hired and given an employment pass while on s-pass."
16436,Same crowdedness as usual... Serious qn: can a employer demand for compensation if a maid spread the virus to their family?
16437,Wow maid agencies are part of the problem
16438,No need to hire foreign workers lmao.
16439,"But well....I guess it's nice for the maids to dress up, parade around, and have people cheer for them."
16440,"Remember that, in most developed parts of the world (US/Canada/NZ/Australia/Western Europe) middle class can’t afford maids."
16441,Paying more money doesn’t help with the abuse on maids but instead it would worsen the situation because employers would think they are paying too much.
16442,"employers should be educated on the Laws, the rights of the domestic helpers and etc and lastly have some  sort of empathy test to see if they are suitable mentally."
16443,I’m seeing lots of these SG gov’t failed migrant workers articles lately in the foreign media.
16444,"Aside from the dormitory conditions, that existed before Covid, what more could have been done to prevent this apparent loss of control?"
16445,It’s not racism.
16446,Penning this in light of the recent case of [Chinese individuals who have been targeted with racist remarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ocb2lo/man_arrested_over_racially_charged_remarks_attack/).
16447,"I felt like I had to bring this thought up though, as people could naturally respond with ""Chinese priv doesn't exist/ we Chinese face racism too!"""
16448,Think back to the incidences of racism that minorities have shared.
16449,"Additionally, people bring up racist and xenophobic sentiments when it surrounds immigrants and migrant workers here."
16450,"To end off, basically just read the room and understand whether someone is getting the long end of the racism stick."
16451,"People ""work up the rage"" because it's a privilege to be indifferent about racism."
16452,"For people who bear the brunt of racism, I think they have the right to be angry."
16453,"So, it would be logical that the bulk of Singapore's unskilled foreign workers would come from Malaysia, Indonesia and other local countries."
16454,"The fix needs to come from above of course and it'll most likely mean dipping into their pockets to open state funded nurseries so that parents can continue to work, it'll also mean that domestic workers get paid better, better living conditions and more workers rights."
16455,I've probably missed a thousand other things that domestic workers deserve but abuse is certainly not one of them
16456,"And yes, I believe there are kind racists and not all racists are unkind."
16457,Alot of us will probably experience racism first hand ourselves for the first time then.
16458,"Some questions that might interest you,  1.Why does the police force take racism remarks extremely seriously?"
16459,"Singaporeans are pretty much used to living with all kinds of people, there's hardly xenophobic sentiments or strong distaste of foreigners...except maybe against certain groups of people."
16460,I can't imagine a world without curry and I'm a white expat from Canada.
16461,That is not racist.
16462,"For Temasek to make accusations of ""xenophobia, racism, \[and\] hate speech"" against those who have raised concerns about its hiring practices and organisational culture is very unbecoming of a public institution, which should not be trying to help the government score cheap political points."
16463,and young people arguing against foreign workers are absolutely lacking the comprehension of what  will happen if the subsidising effects of foreigners is removed from the local old age suppory ratio (working pop supporting aging pop) at current demographic curve.
16464,"- Construction is at 1/5 cost amd 1000% the capacity of the internal economy enabling generations of people to get affordable BTO and enjoy a very high standard of living because of the systematic exploitation for foreign workers  - Two incomes are needed in almost any developed country to sustain a family today but in Singapore people have incredibly subsidised access to domestic helpers  - As a tiny country Singapore has access to put-of-its league research, development and top of the line companies creating significant opportunities beyond what similar countries in its weight class can provide to their citizens because we are able to attract the best of the best here."
16465,"Locals don't want these jobs, they are hard work for very little money and just like construction, the care costs would multiply into unaffordable territory instantly if you took out these foreign workers."
16466,"I have nothing against expats as a whole, and I think that they are necessary for the economy, but it is articles like this that serves as a catalyst for anti-foreigner sentiment and seeks to stir up tensions."
16467,"If S-Pass holders have a minimum salary of $4.5k, we can still attract young foreign talents."
16468,"People are perhaps more pissed at the government for not establishing a more thorough and effective system for verifying the qualification and quality of the kind of "" CECA talents"" that had been let in before but rather we had let in "" talents "" with fake qualifications from degree mills that locals would otherwise filled that appointment with the relevant qualification."
16469,"For a government that has been lauded and known for our high level of efficiency and capacity, such pitfalls of CECA should not have been allowed to happen in the first place and the citizens have every reason to feel resentment and shortchanged by our government's failing in this particular aspect."
16470,"People are racist, that's our primitive characteristic, no matter what the environment, it will never change us intrinsically"
16471,A motherhood statement that CECA is not the cause doesn’t really explain anything.
16472,I realise this will be construed as xenophobic/racist by those that want to do so but it’s a simple logic exercise right?
16473,It’s the same way we can hire uni grads from the Philippines to be domestic workers because they can earn more here.
16474,"But I don’t see why just because some gay people are racist you should not be ally to gay people in general/the lgbt movement, which, after all, also includes queer racial minorities."
16475,"I’m gay, and I know some people who are racial minorities who are homophobic, but that doesn’t mean I’m not against racism."
16476,People are xenophobic towards migrant workers when it was the cheap rich Singaporeans who hired them in the first place.
16477,"People assume that the locals here treat their maids in an employer/employee relationship, imo, from what ive heard and from a large majority of my ex-colleagues, the relationship between them and their maid is closer to modern day slavery where the maid should be grateful that they managed to work for them and shouldnt complain about the conditions they may face with the family, or the demands put forth on them."
16478,People can be both classist AND racist.
16479,People can be racist and also mentally ill.
16480,People coming in on VTL flights aren't subjected to Stay Home Notice they just have to isolate before the on arrival PCR test results are out.
16481,That info refers to people coming in on non VTL flights
16482,The people who are overwhelmingly in support of the ban a denominally racists!
16483,"Though, it is to be expected I guess due to the nature and the thinly veiled racism that drips in the sub."
16484,People do talk about it but nothing has been done so far to protect employers from recalcitrant FDWs.
16485,"It's easily to blame the workers for their hygiene when you work from 9-5, a maid taking cares of all your chores an the most strenuous task you do during your work is to lift your ass from the chair."
16486,They must be racist.
16487,So everything is now racist which really ends up meaning nothing is racist
16488,"Some people have differing views from others, hence why some get offended, and some dont  No, because my point was never about the difference between stereotypes and racism."
16489,The travel restriction is a step in the right direction but they better close off the dorm cases fast.
16490,But when you ask people if they are ok with foreign workers getting fair wages or blanket minimum wage they get riled up about inflation.
16491,"People got freaked out by MOH's category of ""work permit holders not residing in dorms"" and their minds immediately went to maids."
16492,"If they had checked the annexes, they would have seen that there were hardly any female work permit holders."
16493,"And of the few female work permit holders, even fewer were of the right age and nationalities to be maids (e.g."
16494,Malaysians and PRCs cannot be FDWs).
16495,MOM issued advisories to FDW employers on Mar 20 to ask their FDWs to stay home (not compulsory at that point though).
16496,The first foreign worker to be confirmed (not counting the original 5 Seletar Aerospace guys that probably didn't trasmit further) was around Mar 25.
16497,FW->FDW transmission.
16498,Waving a magic wand and says CECA had no part to play in it is hard to reconcile and this was the Govt’s time to explain it better rather than obfuscate.
16499,People have had their PR renewal rejected for much lesser crimes.
16500,"When the government wants to integrate foreign talent (get married) and boost the population, Singaporeans pay for the infrastructure, education and healthcare costs."
16501,People hire FDWs so that they can spend the time productively by earning money.
16502,We are not racist!
16503,"I'm not racist, I just wanna know."
16504,My best friend is Indian so I'm not racist.
16505,This group has a large overlap with the SG Opposition Facebook group which was formed to discuss issues during GE2020 but has been hijacked by the racist anti-CECA crowd to dogwhistle their racism.
16506,People just cannot separate racism from factual observation.
16507,Given a random picture of a chinese person they would not immediately assume him to be a PRC and spout their racist drivel.
16508,People like that are giving expats a bad name.
16509,People like you are the reason racism will always be rife.
16510,Another joker conditioned to accept racism.
16511,"Let me guess, when a racist comes up to you and offends you and every single person of your colour, you laugh it off as a joke."
16512,"There are tradeoffs, and racism does exist too."
16513,"It's true that the violent incident prodded me to write this up, but my other point about keeping politicians accountable for what they say is still relevant even if we disagree about whether controlled speech helps curbs racism."
16514,"People on this sub are mostly young, and the CECA issue didn't manifest itself until late 2000s."
16515,"People outside this tiny circle jerk of an island understand exactly what the phrase 'no immigrant has a right to here"" means."
16516,"People really need to stop comparing migrant workers' dorms to NS, they are not the same situation at all."
16517,"People sadly would love to just see mediocre transfers and blanket that on a larger expat population, and complain about how Singaporean cannot get a job."
16518,People seem to be willfully missing out that key piece of info because it disrupts their racist narrative.
16519,"Though some may consider xenophobic, there is nothing wrong advocating for a zero immigration law to be passed next day (even if it hurts Singaporeans' self interest)."
16520,"People should get past grouping people as a whole, whether expats, Indian expats, locals, true blue Singaporeans etc and assign them a label."
16521,The point is that not every Indian expat is a Ramesh and not every Singaporean is a Beow Tan.
16522,There is really no reason to say that Indian expats are fucking us over when some random dude in India is making foolish statements.
16523,"The judge noted that the maid spoke Bahasa Indonesia, and that some words could have been interpreted differently."
16524,(This is actually important because it lent credibility that the maid picked it up from the trash instead of stealing it).
16525,People shouldn't be allowed to have 3rd world live in maids on peanuts wages.
16526,People talking about how SAP schools aren't producing racists have missed the point.
16527,"They closed the familial ties line for partners this year, with the VTL they can come without any problems."
16528,People who do employ maids are generally those with high or middle income.
16529,They most definitely do not employ maids.
16530,"People who have been convicted of abuse to domestic helpers need to be blacklisted for life, jailed and fined heavily."
16531,People whom says it's only boomers doing it must have not see the field pack maid.
16532,When all else fails they start pulling comments like we're xenophobic/racist out of their asses.
16533,"And I've heard a lot of these stories from expats, not locals, they have nothing to gain by saying this shit."
16534,Perfect example of an uneducated and xenophobic singaporean shunning foreigners in Singapore while possibly doing absolutely fk all to contribute at all.
16535,"I consider English my mother tongue - the language I feel most comfortable expressing myself in & more importantly, it's the language I think in."
16536,"But by the end of the year, expat countries will not really be behind masks, and we still will be"
16537,"Perhaps after the land VTL is implemented, they can start to streamline existing testing requirements."
16538,"Air VTLs can’t do that since the host country will incur costs on healthcare and return ticket for infected visitors, but our land connections don’t have the same issues."
16539,Perhaps can modify it to a VTL-like process.
16540,"In any case, it doesn't give anyone the right to practice xenophobia."
16541,"A continuation of the CMIO approach, making sure no one group falls too far behind?"
16542,"Or perhaps it’s time for true integration, particularly with more and more inter-racial marriages and the rather rapid detachment from cultural roots of the younger generation, many of whom barely speak the mother tongue at all if they can help it."
16543,"Perhaps it is your opinion that this practice is xenophobic but saying such things without providing any substantial evidence, and accusing others of being xenophobic, name calling others in this thread as racist - is all extremely unnecessary and counter productive to anyone with proper suggestions and points to contribute."
16544,"Perhaps the impact that was meant to be delivered was not just based on ""person A's crime on person B"", but to drive a point at ""employers vs FDW""."
16545,"Perhaps they're talking about cases such as Filipino families with Filipina maids, Malay families with Indonesian maids, etc."
16546,Or perhaps just rephrasing certain questions into a level of English that the maids might understand better.
16547,"I guess it would be fair to set benchmarks and dictate a country to be on an extreme end of racism, and work backwards from there to where we stand."
16548,"Most people are racist to an extent, and keep it to themselves."
16549,"Compare their treatment of the Gurkhas with that of the Belgians in the Congo, for example; the British adopted a relatively more enlightened approach than the brutally simplistic racism that has informed the bulk of our anti-colonial rhetoric."
16550,They were particularly excited when I told them about VTLs and how our neighbors are also opening up in early 2022.
16551,"The $125 arrival PCR (this was discussed back in Jan) was a very steep price restriction, along with the SQ VTL flights being almost twice as expensive as the non-VTL UA ones."
16552,My parents got this reverse racism shit where they only trust Indian doctors and lawyers.
16553,I have not seen any fellow chinese classmate or colleague racist or said anything disrespectful.
16554,I feel offended when we all get sweeped into this just because of a few minority racists as if there is an epidemic of racist chinese in Singapore towards Indians.
16555,Personally experienced racism in many stages of my life  Schooling: Teachers joking about how you don’t see many malays here because they lepak  NS: Commanders asking if I’m malay (I get easily tanned under the sun).
16556,"There will always be racists around us, it’s a deeply ingrained thing since young, but OP please don’t let it affect you because there are people (evident from all the comments) who know your struggles and recognise that the problem exists and should change in this generation."
16557,I have no problems with individuals that are racists.
16558,"You can treat maids with respect etc, or choose to abuse them."
16559,"There will always be a black sheep, much like some maids stealing stuff etc, so you cant really pinpoint a mistake and harp over it."
16560,"The difference of slave and maid is that maid are paid, given rest time, more rights and venue to complain to should they be abused."
16561,The only way to resolve this issue is exercise higher penalty for both the employer and employee should there be any form of abuse by the employer and maid respectively.
16562,Personally i think its a combination of race/xenophobia + socioeconomic factors.
16563,"Anw the deportation is govt policy for floundering the rules and i think Grace Fu was making a point about how SGaporeans are xeno/racist, which i dont disagree."
16564,"Personally, I don't resent immigrants."
16565,"Personally, I feel this is more of a reaction towards fear of the Covid-19 virus rather than actual racism."
16566,"I'm not claiming that racism does not exist here in Singapore, it does."
16567,"Personally, I think that understanding that there are other systemic factors that produce this kind of xenophobia does not necessarily mean that we should blame the government for failing to account for these factors."
16568,"But I think it's still important to recognise these systemic factors, especially if this xenophobic behaviour is common enough that it can't be explained by a few bad-faith individuals alone."
16569,"Personally, I think the Govt still misses the point on this entire foreign talent issue."
16570,I believe many will agree that Singapore can never do without foreign talent.
16571,"Personally, with my mother (who is racist against Malays and mainland Chinese even tho we are Chinese) I point out that 1) everyone requires basic respect (I follow up by with the classic treat others like you want to be treated, throw in some religious spiel about how Jesus treated everyone equally etc bc she is religious) 2) the perceptions against Malays were basically due to colonial indoctrination - see myth of the lazy native for more!"
16572,"(my mother is well/uni educated so she will engage with colonial discourse) so she will basically frown and be forced to consider WHY she inherited those perceptions in the first place 3) with mainland Chinese (usually retailer or manual workers) I emphasize how a lot of them are here to find better lives and for them English isn't the first Lang so she rly shouldn't shit on them for trying to work hard 🙃  I basically call them out at every turn - ymmv, my family is well educated that they SHOULD understand racism is dumb and bad but I Guess Asian parents be deeply stubborn and entrenched in backwards views sometimes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
16573,Petty whataboutism + racism.
16574,"Instead of seeing as solvable differences in culture, you see it as crass racism and go on a whiteknight jihad for it, turning it into a moral issue, going for a tit for tat never ending witchhunt that in the end creates more problems between factions than it solves."
16575,You anti racists are infact the worse sort of racists because you refuse to see cultural difference and instead prefer to see race only.
16576,Fuck these dormitory operators.
16577,Phrasing isn’t great - highlights how we think of domestic workers as a product that has a price
16578,16 charges and still not banned from hiring maids?
16579,Some immigrants know the best affordable food in SG maybe even better than us.
16580,"Them shouldnt get pink IC ever, but by virtue of class or opportunities, would find it easier to get a citizenship than a shipyard foreman or chambermaid who has been here 30 years."
16581,"Pinoy maids are the most expensive, that's why the Indos are now most popular"
16582,"They pretty much either had permanent spots back home or promotions slated for them, but popped down to Singapore temporarily for the expat pay or to pad their resume with an overseas supervisory stint."
16583,"In CATO's dreamland, immigrants get a chance for a better life and citizens have cheaper goods and services (how can they pay for those goods and services is another problem)."
16584,So you get horrid living conditions for immigrants and economic insecurity for the locals.
16585,But these construction companies probably have won contracts based on the budgeting of their current supply of foreign workers.
16586,"For every expats that leave, another one will gladly come and take over your place."
16587,"Please Malay Muslims are a minority race, they **can't** be racist!"
16588,"Please by all means feel free to live in Malaysia where you have bumi seats in university, bumi plots of land as formalized institutional racism that affects every single soul on top of the implicit racial discrimination that minorities face."
16589,Yes Singapore has racial discrimination in institutions like the SAF but it's nothing close to the racism enshrined in the Constitution over there.
16590,The last time I saw someone stupid enough to argue the point of view you're espousing it was Sangeetha and she didn't move to Malaysia when she fled our racist shithole did she?
16591,"Please consider giving what you can, however much that is within your means, to causes that you believe in—whether this might be an organization advocating for the elderly who are struggling even more so now with isolation, children who need laptops for home schooling, women who are at higher risk of domestic abuse, people whose mental health has taken a nosedive, or the migrant worker community."
16592,An expat would take 5k as a whole and company got nothing to contribute on top of that.
16593,He literally claimed that the foreign workers would have hookups with the maids.
16594,Please tell me how is this not racist?
16595,Please don't make me regret case studying #PewdiepievsT-Series for racism... ...
16596,"If you bring in more foreign workers, it increases the risk of an outbreak in a dormitory (even with SHN, the risk is never zero)."
16597,"Please don’t downvote me, but I think the government policy of segregating locals and migrant workers is actually a humane policy."
16598,"After the war, due to manpower shortage, the country relies a lot of migrant workers from North African region with stringent controls on their eventual settlement."
16599,Eventually these migrant workers settle down in many large cities sub urban area but never really assimilate into the local communities.
16600,"On mistreatment of domestic workers, I think this needs to stop, for sure."
16601,"I guess in additional to training FDW, prospective employers should also undergo trainings too!"
16602,Please dun fit everything into the racist card.
16603,I just want to say this whole situation can be handled so much better if it was an educational piece for everyone to learn rather than taking sides and then calling other people racist.
16604,"Please explain like I'm 5 why when someone say they don't like inter racial marriage or dating, that person gets chastised by a minister; but when ""Singaporeans"" say they are not ready for a non-chinese PM, the government just accept as it is and move on instead of calling out the racism."
16605,"Please explain your enlightening, racist and backwards thinking."
16606,"In a post about racism you take the opportunity shoehorn your anti government opinion just because it came from a minister, how low are u?"
16607,"Was waiting for a friend at the airport, when a maid walked out of the arrivals door, before she could even put her bag down, her passport was snatched out of her hands by the agent."
16608,"I thought it was a theft at first, was about to yell for the police but apparently that's how they treat maids now."
16609,"Please lar, VTL flight are probably not even enough to cover cost for the airlines"
16610,"Please look after your maids, treat them well and don’t have them do unreasonable tasks."
16611,Trying to paint me as a racist/xenophobe/lazy local is about as lame a strawman as one can raise.
16612,\-Get rid of restrictions  \-Stop the VTL stuff  \-Stop TT alltogether
16613,> The working conditions for foreign workers here in Singapore are atrocious.
16614,"For examples, see the Facebook pages of ""Humans of Singapore"" and ""All Singapore Stuff""   > What do redditporeans do to improve working conditions for migrant workers?"
16615,How do you think the authorities can act to improve working conditions for migrant workers?
16616,"If you wanted to put in more effort, r/singapore has had several discussions on migrant workers before too - so you could reference that."
16617,"Later on, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Ukrainian immigrants were subject to various awful laws, rules and behaviour."
16618,"In fact, she's the racist one for assuming Japanese/Korean people are Chinese"
16619,Please report the maid agency to MOM.
16620,The law already says the domestic helper is not liable for her covid costs.
16621,https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ntr14n/what_is_racism_in_singapore/h0vfx16?context=3
16622,Please share how anti-Muslim sentiments in Europe are different from the racism you experience here.
16623,"Phobia is being scared, they are not scared they are racist."
16624,Committing atrocities against maids is a Singaporean pastime
16625,She doesn't need to stir up xenophobia at all because just look at what's happening in HK?
16626,"Please, like most Singaporeans, we're not racist."
16627,"Please, like the racists can tell the difference."
16628,Plenty of other first world nations have both parents working without the requirement for maids.
16629,"In order to make it work here you'd need to knock the kiasu attitudes on the head though - wholesale changes like better paternity/maternity leave, flexible working hours for parents, affordable childcare options etc - and there's no real demand to do that when someone can just hire a filipino maid so cheaply."
16630,"Plot twist: households with maids jealous of other households who allow their maids to use facilities, so want to impose ban so that others don't 'spoil market'."
16631,"Silly Singapore is so dependent on maids that they need to systematically subdue them, make them feel and live as 2nd class/ lower caste  people."
16632,I am not even denying there is racism here.
16633,"I am lamenting her choice of platform, her choice of audience, use of anecdotes and extremely isolated examples to suggest there is a widespread racism issue in Singapore."
16634,Plus do maid chores for other prisoners.
16635,The foreign workers don't have such luxuries.
16636,"Point 1, on domestic helpers."
16637,Malay family hiring Indonesian helper while doing this racist?
16638,Is racist even the correct choice of vocabulary when you are talking about lack of basic humanity?
16639,So she has one racist friend so let's bring other Singaporeans in.
16640,So one group of aunties (race not mentioned) are racist.
16641,"If there were more Malay and Indian folk who rent out their units, I sure as hell think their first choice tenants are of the same race but that does not mean they are racist."
16642,:(  The spread happened because of living conditions beyond the migrant workers' control: the folks working on the ground to check the spread ought to know that.
16643,But this is documented racism.
16644,"For sure expats will fly away and even if they want to stay, SG populist opinion is to kick them out."
16645,"Singapore is still very foreign talent friendly, let us know how it goes!"
16646,Poor expats ): I also wanna become an expat
16647,Poor expats after these years with Covid they have lost their abilities to use their hands and resort to more primitive way of showing their emotions
16648,"I always cringe when people say their maid is fussy and doesn’t want to eat any food, like that is ever true."
16649,And I’m sure people will reply to this with “no really Our maid never wants to eat blabla”.
16650,Poor migrant workers.
16651,"Conservatives often think they're against populism because it's a destabilizing force which threatens existing power structures, but then progressives also don't like populism because it's associated with anti-immigrant and nationalist rhetoric."
16652,"Now some populists might say that's not the definition of populism to which I would say ""as if I would listen to people who are literally fascist communist scum of the earth tearing society apart with your extremist demagogue race riots mob rule cancel culture racist xenophobe class warfare""."
16653,Here were are just treated as western and lumped in with expats.
16654,"Possibly because although they might have contracted the virus from a dormitory cluster/construction site, they generally have more interactions with the larger community as compared to dormitory-based based cases due to the greater freedoms they enjoy."
16655,"Anecdote from an acquaintance who is Brahmin but also totally Singaporean, working at MPA, and he accidentally scared a bunch of foreign workers trying to get close and be friendly, that's when he learned they were untouchables and getting near him was ... worse than death?"
16656,I know racism is around forever and now they are just being filmed but people 50yrs ago were singing “imagine all the people living life in peace” tot it would be much better while I think still not enough!
16657,Take foreign workers for example.
16658,"So we saw a maid who was taking care of an ahma who got hospitalised too, but we noticed that she didn't eat for the entire time we were there (and it was for several days)."
16659,Throughout the day we smuggled some food for the maid to eat but she was so deathly afraid to accept it initially because the ahma will scold her.
16660,It feels like maid abuse at this stage.
16661,Any suggestions on how to help without worsening the situation for the maid as well?
16662,"Power over another human's life is intoxicating, the problem is this power is mostly unchecked and since most of these maids are from poorer countries some Singaporeans think they are feeding this woman's whole family back home so they ""own"" her."
16663,"To be clear, I am against racism."
16664,So no this guy isn't your typical expat.
16665,I wouldn't blame it as blatant racism but probably ignorance.
16666,"Pray tell, are an expat?"
16667,I personally don't think the ad was actually racist.
16668,But to me it didn't qualify as racist.
16669,"Blackface had its origins rooted in actual racist reasons, white people were using it to mock black stereotypes in theatre."
16670,"So the outrage is really just a simple-minded case of ""wah blackface is racist so brownface must be racist also lah!"""
16671,"To me, ""racist or not"" depends on intention."
16672,"If I say something with zero intention to be racist but somehow someone just decided he will see it as a racist action, is it really racist?"
16673,"It is wrong to scream ""racist"" just because you *felt* offended by what you *perceived* to be an action taken to belittle your race."
16674,What if not every member of that race felt that the act was racist?
16675,"I've been to white-majority countries and had people say and do things that I understand can be perceived as racist, but eh, so what."
16676,"Precisely, no one willing let their maid get poached unless they are guaranteed another maid in short order."
16677,"As an aside, I wouldn't even put this under the umbrella of racism as it is more a matter of religion (Islam) than race (Malays) - now *that* is another can of worms altogether."
16678,In four years I never experienced one iota of racism but I'm sure my Chinese peers or even South Asian muslim peers studying alongside me might have a different story to tell simply because societal prejudices are more prevalent toward them.
16679,"That doesn't make those prejudices right and that doesn't give me the right to say ""Oh there's no racism in the UK cos I as a brown man neh kena""."
16680,The Speak Mandarin campaign was about being able to speak your own mother tongue proficiently and the Chinese population was the one that was falling behind.
16681,"There's a reason why everytime an occasional foreigner posts something here asking about taxation or moving to Singapore it's always down voted, even when that innocent dude has nothing to do with immigration policy."
16682,Preference by race is racist.
16683,"EDIT: Bro, I looked at your comment history and I think we are on the same page when it comes to racism?"
16684,It’s only racist if it stems from things that is stereotypically linked to their race.
16685,“oh I don’t date Indian because they’re all smelly.”) then that’s racist.
16686,Preference on basis of race is racism.
16687,Premium article for expats 🤔
16688,Presumably these racists are Chinese Sing---- don't they realize the hypocrisy.
16689,"And for that matter, they seem so comfortable as ""Singaporean"" but go spend 1 week in a western country like the US and no one will think you are Singaporean, you will just be a mainland Chinese and will enjoy all the racism and hate that entails."
16690,There's so much favouritism and casual racism against Chinese officers there.
16691,"If you're also earning a high income here, with low taxes, that aids your overall financial security (most of the expats I know that have come here have left with either more money or more earning capacity than when they arrived)."
16692,"Pretty much every expat who gets posted to India and Jakarta gets a car and driver, not a strictly Japanese company thing."
16693,Pretty much every race has the capacity for racism.
16694,Pretty much once they get approval from ICA to come in via the VTL route
16695,The majority of my expat colleagues (entry level) rent a room in an apartment or share the apartment with a few other expats.
16696,Need maid to help her go to the toilet etc.
16697,"But in general, yes, if your school allows it, then if you were (say) Chinese, you could take German as mother tongue."
16698,"Pretty rich coming from Shanmugam, the de facto attack dog whenever a minority talks about experiencing racism in Singapore"
16699,"And if people arent coming in through the CECA policy, then what’s your issue with it?"
16700,Pretty sure some guy is going to ask migrant workers for anonymous opinions and ask whether she needs to apologize.
16701,Approaching a migrant worker feels as if she thinks they’re beneath her
16702,"Like do you want travel restrictions in place for longer, or are you saying the testing regime/requirements need to be fixed, want to stir a bit of drama, etc."
16703,"EDIT: It just occured to me, how are they affected by the virus when they're one of the most isolated, xenophobic countries in existence?"
16704,Many would rather send their maid back and poach another maid if they do not finish contract to prevent maid from getting any bargaining power.
16705,"While they are fun and places like Gardens by the Bay and MBS are beautiful, some of my favorite memories of being an expat in SG come from times I spent at more local places like the hawkers at random HDBs or just taking the MRT around the island and exploring."
16706,Prima cannot protect their reputation while retaining the racist employee.
16707,:\ I'm pretty sure she's not racist at heart.
16708,That migrant worker already demanded something from a minister.
16709,"Prior to cutting all communications with the loanshark, my grandmother already told him that the maid has left the country."
16710,It is an example of active racism and prejudice.
16711,"If I told you my stance is that the government should highlight and address the active racism using their monopoly on violence, and leave the debate and action on privilege to the grassroot collectives, you would have a misunderstanding of my stance because you would think I would be not for legislating against employment discrimination."
16712,"Privilege or advantage, at least in Singapore when someone behaves in a racist manner, it’ll be frown upon or it will backfire like crazy."
16713,Calling it a Chinese ban is “xenophobic” but calling it a travellers from China ban may not?
16714,At least we can confirm she was xenophobic.
16715,"Having played on the racism of part of the populace to win supporters, they might feel emboldened because their president shares their views, and strike out at minority groups and the like more often than they already do."
16716,Probably cause of racism
16717,Do you think expats will be treated with the same disdain as migrant workers who broke the law?
16718,"Not just migrant workers, all impecunious ppl are vulnerable, and all ppl who are accused are vulnerable by definition in my POV."
16719,"But criminal justice system needs to be refined, thinking about condition of migrant workers who are stuck in this predicament."
16720,"Probably not relevant as an anecdote, but a fews years back when I was very fresh from uni, I entered TATA and was shocked to see that the entire senior management/middle management organization chart was all Indian nationals + 1 expat."
16721,(All of them are based in SG)  It was pretty hard to wrap my head around the idea that an APAC HQ based in Singapore has consisted almost all of expats.
16722,"All expats live in condos and probably have their families here, children's international school fees all covered."
16723,An ex-expat's wife gave birth to twins in Mount Elizabeth and all expenses were paid for.
16724,"And yes, that's exactly what gaslighting it, trying to blame minorities for something they don't do, being sarcastic about it, and trying to dilute their voice  Most minorities are well aware that racism is prevalent within their communities as well and they do condemn it."
16725,Probably the same people that would let immigrants in to the UK when the NHS system is already overburdened
16726,Probably too high volume for land checkpoint to make VTL viable though.
16727,Managing a maid is a delicate task.
16728,"At the end of the day, What SGunited are we talking about if foreign talents end up being preferred rather than local talent, mostly just because they are cheaper to employ?"
16729,Our media always like to consolidate the foreign workers that help us with construction with the foreign talent in an attempt to distract.
16730,You racist!
16731,How can you refute this claim in a victim-centric definition of what racism is?
16732,Problem with xenophobia and local blaming FTs for their own incompetence/inability to land a well paying job.
16733,I brought in a maid from Philippines and on the 3rd day she messaged my wife to say that she was positive.
16734,"Finally managed to find someone who did, and said that our maid is serology positive but Covid negative right now."
16735,So we called our agent and told him we don't want the maid as she may have come into contact with other Covid patients in the bus AND the Tuas facility.
16736,"Total cost was over $4k but managed to get refund for the time that was not served at the quarantine hotel (original cost was $1.7k), and also the maid agency refunded half of his fee."
16737,Luckily current maid decided to stay on after hearing about the horror Covid stories in the Philippines from the agent.
16738,"Choosing to act shocked pikachu while posting video of racist incidents on Facebook ignores the cause and effects that current policies (or lack of) have provided, and also ignores how our society have become a prime breeding ground for racist and xenophobic sentiments to prosper."
16739,"Because religion, culture and race are the root of racism."
16740,The one who is racist is the one looking for distinction and separation.
16741,"Despite being divided over many issues, the fact that Non-Malay leader seem to have same concern as Malay leader supports the argument that it was an actual concern back then, and not just a racist remark by Non-Malay leader."
16742,"Without foreign talents, Singapore would not be where it is today."
16743,We should manage the negative and help the people who suffers because of it but for the greater good we need to continue to attract foreign talent.
16744,You sound annoyed people are not likely to sympathize with you because you can afford to hire a maid.
16745,I'm sorry that a significant number of the population who can't even afford a maid can't sympathize with your plight.
16746,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population  Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Augilla, Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Andorra, Monaco, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein."
16747,Proud to note that Singapore is making big strides in the VTL scheme
16748,How can we pressure PAP to not open travel restrictions too soon?
16749,Provide said maid with WiFi password?
16750,Providing (and paying) for the maid's daily meals is stated in the contract and is a legal requirement by MOM.
16751,"If employer won't provide (and pay for) adequate meals, then the law is on the maid's side."
16752,It can be counted as maid abuse.
16753,Hiring a maid is a huge responsibility.
16754,"By hiring a maid, one must be prepared to look after her mental/physical health and welfare as she is living in the same household."
16755,Cost of hiring a maid is much more than just her salary.
16756,Pst from the nearby O level thread :p  How did you do with your mother tongue?
16757,I hope one day those racists could put aside race as a dividing factor and be more loving of other races.
16758,There are stereotypes about each racial group here but I would not go as far as to say there are many racists (less older generation / ignorant assholes)
16759,"Put it this way, that FDW is asking for $900 + all those criteria, is being seen as unreasonable to perspective employers because its not the market norm."
16760,"If there's an employer that's willing to meet those requests, or desperate enough, then the FDW will get employed."
16761,"Else, the FDW will stay unemployed at an agency."
16762,Put them in the same jail cell as the maid who poisoned a baby.
16763,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/d6snwe/3_years_jail_for_maid_who_mixed_detergent_into/
16764,Put this and someone is going to say it is implied racism anyway.
16765,"The dormitory operators are profit run and they charge the foreign workers rent to live there, and once the pandemic started the tax payers, that means you and I are paying for the foreign workers to be rehoused, when it should be the dormitory operators who should be preparing for the social distancing measures."
16766,">**In the next few days, we have a larger population of migrant workers in various purpose-built dormitories completing their isolation period and being tested for COVID-19**."
16767,"As some of them came from dormitories with higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection, we **can expect a higher number of confirmed cases in the next few days** from this group of migrant workers."
16768,"\- from MOH's afternoon [press release on 14 Jul](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/347-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-14jul)  The current rise in the number is due to the ""targeted testing of migrant workers completing their isolation period""."
16769,"""Anti-racists"" behaviour has some unintended consequences."
16770,"Racism - as a fellow POC, I'd say 'casual racism' is more common that the serious / violent kind."
16771,"Violent racism is rare, never have to think about it leaving home."
16772,"Despite all that noise about racism lately, you will find that people here are generally quiet with a nonchalant attitude to strangers."
16773,Perhaps you might want to reach out to other expatriates on their point of view.
16774,"Now, the downside risks for a not so cordial departure - Your employment pass may not be cancelled or depending on your pay, industry and position you might not get a new EP with a diff employer."
16775,"There, no more racism; everyone gets the same deal."
16776,"They are quite unapologetic about it and the way they justify it is the same as racist white people using it, like, ""Black people use it all the time, so why can't I?"""
16777,"We currently peg the value of house work at around $1000 per month (after FDW salary, FDW levy, ancillary costs of living)."
16778,Our government (and some Singaporeans) which thinks mostly in dollars and cents would be hard-pressed to accept stay-at-home spouses replacing FDWs since the economic cost would be too substantial.
16779,Quite crappy there is no compulsory maid insurance for healthcare (there is only PA for $60k)
16780,Quite curious which exactly this refers to:  \> Enhanced testing regime for travellers arriving on VTLs will be ceased  I am guessing travellers no need to do ART for 7 days?
16781,Discrimination against that population has been [rife](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2014/2/19/indias-northeast-speaks-out-against-racism) even before Covid and it has been [exacerbated](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/northeast-citizens-faced-racial-discrimination-amid-covid-19-outbreak-says-govt-study/article34303162.ece) since.
16782,"Edit:  [Charles Yeo, TheTwainHaveMet, and Xenophobia](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i38a96/charles_yeo_thetwainhavemet_and_xenophobia/) \- remembered about this post from a month or two back and I think it's an interesting read on the same topic (CY)!"
16783,"1/ it’s not racist what, she said landlord has preference for profile not race  2/ it’s not racist what, she said landlord prefer Caucasian or Japanese expat  3/ it’s not racist what, she said lease is not suitable  4/ it’s not racist what, Chinese landlord is ok with Malay tenants."
16784,"5/ it’s not racist what, landlord doesn’t want PRC also  6/ it’s not racist what, landlord just doesn’t want “Indian Indians”  7/ it’s not racist what, it is known that many Indians cook curry and dirty the place into an unrentable state."
16785,This forces the maid (agency) to either stay in the role or negotiate with new employer to cover the cost.
16786,To deal with foreign workers locked up for the past 2 years.
16787,&#x200B;  >I remember getting on the bus near Novena MRT once (not exactly an expat enclave and definitely not the heartlands) and a father said to his kid.
16788,"&#x200B;  >Honestly, compared to living in Mainland China, Taiwan, and Japan, - I believe that Singapore is the best place as far as living condition, pace of life, and lack of xenophobia."
16789,RE: #3 - some say nationality of NATO member states rank higher for European immigrants.
16790,"RIP, looks like my dad has to wait another 2 more years to meet his wife it seems despite there being no VTL for Indonesia"
16791,feel sorry for the maid who had to come all the way to sg only to lose her life..
16792,If so then it is racist
16793,As for your third option that is litterally the landlord assuming that the customer is racist by asking if he is ok with a certain race like i've pointed out before.
16794,Race and Religion are two entirely different thing but imho Islamophobia is rooted in racism.
16795,Also the whole issue about the Malays' ethnic and religious ties with its ASEAN neighbour being reasons to discriminate them from SAF speaks to the whole islamophobia=racism.
16796,"Race has got to be a biggest factor if you’re a non Chinese, Malay or Indian expat right?"
16797,"The government has outright said that they want to have a immigration policy that maintains the current racial make up i.e, they want to maintain people belong to the “others” racial category at 1.6%."
16798,That necessarily means that each year our intake of immigrants would be similar to the existing racial demographic.
16799,"So each year, only 1.6% of naturalised immigrants can be “others”."
16800,"To put it bluntly, if you’re a non-CMI expat, this kind of odds makes it virtually impossible for you to ever be naturalised in Singapore."
16801,so are banks institutionalising racism?
16802,Race-based discrimination *is* racism.
16803,Racial ignorance is the same as racism.
16804,"Racial minorities who did not get an A in whatever module he taught, now is the time to go appeal for better results by accusing him of being racist!"
16805,"Black people in America being poorer is one result of marginalization and discrimination from racist laws and policies that were dismantled very recently, and still have lasting consequences."
16806,And not project his own racist tendencies on the victim.
16807,Treating foreigners badly can come as both xenophobic or racist.
16808,Is there a place wiht zero racism?
16809,"Fast forward to now, some cultural norms are hard to change and given the focus on 'white skin' in asian culture, rugged nature of indian workers in general, the behaviour of some of the Indians created an overall stereotype and racist views."
16810,"So racism already existed ""up"" there."
16811,Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who believe racism has no place in society.
16812,People can be racist and not know about it.
16813,It was racist without intent.
16814,Casual racism and stereotyping normalize this kind of behavior and people don't think there is anything wrong in it.
16815,Where did you get your definition of racism from?
16816,"But perhaps we can start by referring to each other as Singaporean brothers and sisters rather than... ""Look, I not racist..."
16817,"However, I can assure you most of the average Singaporean isn't racist, yes you will encounter ignoramuses who say insensitive things unintentionally but most likely they aren't racist at heart."
16818,"However, your attitude towards the occasional racism matters as well, if you're one of those who writes off a country as racist for one or two racist encounters there's nothing much that can be done as well."
16819,"As long as we dont humanise each other, racism will exist."
16820,"Racism exists, but most of them are not racists from the posts."
16821,"They are xenophobic, and unfortunately, the local Indians are very affected by this mainly because many people cannot differentiate local Indians and India Indians well on the surface."
16822,"Have my word that you will also see many Chinese (race) unleashing xenophobic comments if it was a Chinese (race) person with ""PRC face""."
16823,A key issue of modern societies is to prevent ANY racism.
16824,Overcoming racism will be a key challenge of this century to build up competitive economies.
16825,"&#x200B;  Instead, see racism and fight it!"
16826,"I've been reading up on ""us vs them"" theories, survival-instinct theories, even Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalysis, on how racism could have been manifested."
16827,But what is with the sudden uptick in news about racists attacks?
16828,"There's the ""racism"" of verbal despise that polite society condems, the ""racism"" of ethnicity-based biases of each individual, the ""racism"" of preferring (in dating partners) certain physical traits and features that are more common in certain ethnicities, the ""(systematic) racism"" of policies that (inadvertently or otherwise) give advantages to specific ethnicities, and the ""racism"" of preferring to interact with certain cultures (sometimes foreign cultures) more than others."
16829,"Usually it comes across in the form of jokes and not overtly racist, but just because its a joke doesnt mean that people's feelings do not get hurt."
16830,"The remark may seem harmless, but looking deeper you can sense racist undertones, even if none were meant."
16831,The responses were as expected mostly a circlejerk regarding how the real truth is being suppressed and falsely called racists with the most highly upvoted post-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ef18kr/genuine\_question\_why\_do\_some\_singaporean/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ef18kr/genuine_question_why_do_some_singaporean/)  \> Everything wanna bargain.
16832,It might be true that Indians to do this on a statically higher than average basis but the rhetoric through which it's explained is what makes it racist.
16833,"Again this is reapted trend through /r/Singapore posts discussing Indians, racism and stereotyping as smelly casteist bigots without awareness of the Irony."
16834,"Opposition to Immigration doesn't make you racist, but the arguments used often hold these racist overtones of protecting against the sub-human Indian masses."
16835,"Racism is a poorly defined spectrum that is mistaken for binary label, that either you are or you aren't, but things aren't always black and white  People fall all along the racism spectrum (bell curve), all the way from 0 to genocide  Where people draw the line tends to depend on their perspective, for one, the minority tend to draw the line lower, and majority tend to draw the line further  But ultimately its just a name, like how ""circuit-breaker"" is by all measures a lockdown, but gov knows.. semantics is important  Don't let our limited vocabulary distract the real issue here, whether it was an ""honest mistake"" or an ""isolated incident"", it shouldn't have come from government"
16836,Racism is alive and well in SG but people are not allowed to freely spread racism messages that may create violence in the name of freedom of speech.
16837,Racism is bad but I don't support arresting people for racism.
16838,"Everyone should also acknowledge that we all have biases and prejudice within us, so when you see racist behaviour, be it explicit or implicit, we should find a way to turn it into a positive somehow and learn from it so both sides understand that words, gestures and actions (including passive complicity by not calling it out) have true impact to other people’s feelings, doesn’t matter if it was intentional or not, we need to learn from our mistakes and teach our children to do better."
16839,the more the behaviour is normalised ...   you can (not) be a racist and still exhibit racist behaviour.
16840,Racism is costly too but then again when has the law truly cared for racism.
16841,"I know that when I was younger, all the little ""jokes"" made to rile up my primary school friends were just plain stupid and racist."
16842,From being called a Filipino maid to classmates calling my hard working mom a ugly maid.
16843,"No more awkward laughs at racist remarks and no more standing by as someone spews stereotypical ""jokes"" followed by ""Oh just joking""."
16844,But discrimination as a result of racism is the problem here.
16845,I would take the risk here by assuming that you aren't one of the minority who has experienced racism + discrimination first-hand to actually think that it's something that actually does matter.
16846,Racism is here to stay....no point whining about it...that's why i always admire asian dumbos that migrate to the western world to become 2nd class citizens...can u imagine the amount of racist craps they have to endure.
16847,"Don't think in terms of ""how to eradicate racism"", it's better to think in terms of ""be the change you want to see in others""."
16848,"Don't be a racist yourself, maybe even develop a deeper interest in learning about the culture of the other race if you can."
16849,"Ignorance is after all, one of the factors that can contribute to racism."
16850,"When you witness truly racist behavior - keyword truly, like if a friend says ""Malay all lazy and stupid, not like us Chinese so smart and hardworking"", use your own experience and reasoning to tell him why this is not right - for example, you could highlight that there are Malays who are high flyers and Chinese who eat snake at work all the time so it's not about the race and more about the person etc etc  The important thing here is to convince people, not force your morals/opinions on others, pick fights, or ""call out racism"" like what many here like to do, just look at the current US riot of how well that is working out."
16851,"Understand that just because you're not a racist doesn't mean you're a ""saint"" or a ""superior being to others""."
16852,I don't think racism is an issue.
16853,Elitism can be said to be more an issue in Singapore than racism.
16854,Racism is prejudice towards people of another race and xenophobia is fear and hatred of the unknown.
16855,I think it's safe to use these two terms interchangeably in this case because the xenophobia we're talking about here is about discrimination against the Chinese.
16856,"I prefer the word ""racist"" because it's shorter to type out."
16857,Racism is racism.
16858,"Racism is still racism, when is the last time someone dressed up racism to minorities as ""overly sensitive""?"
16859,Ever wonder why SGeans are racist towards the other races except for Ang Mohs?
16860,Which group is majority is irrelevant to whether it's racist or not.
16861,All that changes is the average amount of damage done by the racism.
16862,But if it’s still NOT racism.
16863,PSP sees this as a strategy to win over the racist PAP voters.
16864,Singapore has a massive racism issue.
16865,"But the one consistent factor is racism is the worst when a minority is perceived as a threat ie: terrorism, steal yo jobs etc."
16866,"While it is not to the extent of racial violence or whatever, it can still be mildly racist to assume that Malay weddings = Hari Raya."
16867,"While I slightly agree that the error might be due to ignorance and the lack of due diligence, their response to the concerns that the Malay couple in question has, as described in the article, is definitely racist and wrong."
16868,"I feel that a good number of people here are very prone to idealistic thinking, maybe because a majority are still really young or were a victim of racism and thus have unrealistic notions that someday, everyone will come together as one and sing kumbayah around a campfire."
16869,It's fine to address racism but it's also important we acknowledge that human difference exists.
16870,"When I was schooling back then in the late 90's/early 00's, racism wasn't even a word on people's minds, sure we each made racist jokes about each others race but it was all in good fun and no one gets butt hurt, yes majority mostly stuck to their own race for friends but that's pretty much human nature at work, doesn't mean we're hostile towards the other race groups."
16871,I'm not sure why is it so many people nowadays just love bringing up and talking about racism all day long when it isn't doing anything except to perpetuate even more racism.
16872,However that is a very shallow understanding of racism as a concept.
16873,Most people think you are attacking Chinese people when you point out how racism disproportionately affects minorities.
16874,"Racism vs Nationalism  Usually intertwined, with xenophobia as the mortar, but the dichotomy is clear nonetheless."
16875,"This is nationalism, not racism."
16876,"Racism, and other forms of prejudice are generally considered to be rooted in xenophobia."
16877,"Don't blame expats or foreigners for racism and xenophobia  The ""tough condition"" actually shows how well this system is working, when condition got tough the bulk of those that loss their jobs were foreigners."
16878,My own gf was forced to leave the country  Those shortsighted clueless racist xenophobes don't realize that many of those jobs can be done remotely.
16879,Large majority of Chinese Sinfaporeans have a implicit racist bias .
16880,"I can’t speak for all Indians but from the few I’ve spoke with, they seem to share the same concern regarding these foreign workers."
16881,I think educating foreign workers is probably a low priority for the government.
16882,"Living here for more than four years, never encountered any racist behavior, always felt treated equally here."
16883,Most of them are just closet racists who won't treat anyone too bad but still think very negatively of you.
16884,"Also, he can't exactly be racist with you in school in a professional setting."
16885,They just want to milk this to justify racism against a group of people they've never liked.
16886,Racists will obviously never see themselves as racists.
16887,"Radicals like Preetipls say racist shit and then claim that it is 'punching up' when called out on it (or in her case, the authorities come after them)."
16888,Then when genuine mistakes like this occur they scream racism until they froth at the mouth.
16889,"Malays were favoured politically, and the immigrant Chinese and Indians economically ( [https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/The-impact-of-British-rule](https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/The-impact-of-British-rule) )."
16890,"The British set up English-medium and Malay-medium schools, but schools specially dedicated to immigrants are funded through community donations (keep in mind for later on)."
16891,are normally taken up by mainland Chinese and Malaysian immigrants who have a far greater mastery of the language.
16892,Most cite incidences of casual racism and ethnic slurs.
16893,"Hence, it is inevitable that a racist remark from a Chinese person would carry more harm, but at the same time be protected by the safety in sheer numbers."
16894,**  Speculation: I think there may be a conflict between the government's duty and its ambitions when it comes to transitioning the Malay community from primarily speaking their mother tongues to speaking English.
16895,"Raise the wages of FDW to 4 figures and suddenly, the dependence falls."
16896,I question the quality of FDWs we get as well.
16897,"Imagine trying to have a maid who's young, in a foreign country with no experience having to take care of elderly who are wheelchair bound or have conditions like dementia."
16898,I don't plan on having a FDW for my family.
16899,My family used to have one almost 20 years ago but that experience was enough to turn us off having a FDW ever again.
16900,"What do you mean by ""foreign talent"" and ""foreign workers""?"
16901,"Be chinese and visit any country in the west or india, see what true rampant and explicit racism looks like."
16902,Rampant xenophobia?
16903,Saying no to rampant immigration when there are already not enough space and resources or jobs for our own people is not xenophobia.
16904,"Random question : If the employer paid the maid an agreed amount, is it still legal?"
16905,"Ranging from various like unpaid salary nasty bosses harassment mistreatment assault racist insult inappropriate retrenchment which are some to name, what else are reportable?"
16906,One has to face racism directly to learn not to discriminate others just because of their race/religion.
16907,This is exacerbated by the fact that many Singaporeans don't seem to be perfectly fluent in their mother tongues either.
16908,casteism: It would probably improve the quality of the discussion of this issue immensely if we actively collected data on the prevalence of barbaric cultural practices in Singapore - it's not fair to either South Asian expats or those who are on the receiving end to either exaggerate or dismiss it on the basis on mere speculation.
16909,"Re: 3 - saving money as an expat  Things get expensive for expats when they can't adjust to local lifestyles here, and end up buying expensive groceries at cold storage, taking cabs everywhere instead of public transport, eating at restaurants all the time instead of food courts/hawker centres, drinking out all the time etc."
16910,"These are mostly the habits of Western (American/European) expats, so since you are from SEA, you may not fall into these expat traps so easily."
16911,Re: The SCMP article posted yesterday on migrant workers.
16912,"CECA, Work Passes, Foreign Talents) 4."
16913,The Pledge only mattered until we got rich enough to “afford” racism.
16914,"And no, we’re not talking about migrant workers, we’re talking about people who come here to settle down."
16915,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs  Let me know which category or categories do you think racism and lgbt issues fall under.
16916,"She’s a divisive, crass, mentally infirm racist."
16917,Last time I checked mental illness didn’t cause racism.
16918,Only in Singapore can you cover up racism as a mental illness.
16919,"We preached the Pledge until we could afford to be racist, after which time we became a Confucianist Chinese-first company."
16920,Reading the article I actually get the impression this was acquitted more due to technicality than the domestic helper not committing the crime
16921,"Reading the article I think the additional focus is that expats are stuck and unable to see family, attend life events etc without major challenges like quarantine (if it's possible at all)."
16922,"It takes bravery to put up a public apology, and this apology shall also serve as a reminder to other Singaporeans that racism is not taken likely."
16923,Won't get snarky or unpleasant comments from people who are racists or perhaps don't know better.
16924,"I agree, we need to be more vocal against racism when we see it."
16925,Reaffirming that the average Singaporean have more things in common with the foreign worker than elites who save on transport but splurge on newspapers.
16926,The foreign worker situation was already a ticking time bomb which exploded during the 2013 Little India riot.
16927,"Real unpopular opinion:  The govnt is being intentionally difficult with regard to the CECA debacle to obfuscate their failures in other areas like response to COVID, treatment of LGBTs and immigration."
16928,CECA is the scapegoat for a variety of failures within the system and both sides are failing to look past the smokescreen.
16929,Realise that many commentators have no real knowledge of working life and people - even maids!- gaming the system.
16930,"Your foreign worker pool, on the other hand, is limitless."
16931,"Given an American accent and unfamiliar features, you'll probably fit most easily into ""expat"" and ""tourist"" boxes."
16932,"If media repeated the need to stay vigilant, more people would be aware it’s not just “a foreign worker problem”    Now you come and accuse people of being biased because of the headlines you publish ?"
16933,"Edit: Most of the people living here are descendants of immigrants, go back 3-4 generations, and you’ll see."
16934,"IMO you just can't rely on people to ""do the right thing"" and not interact with the quarantined person and constantly sanitize for the 14 days before using common areas (especially older folk, sure want to at least come out to living room etc and dunno if maid/family is able to say no to him)."
16935,Especially so if the family members/maid staying with him still can continue to go out and do whatever.
16936,"There needs to be compassion, justice and equity in our policies, that view immigrants as people more than economic agents."
16937,Really hope migrant workers living conditions will improve 😞
16938,The only pple who would benefit from minimum wage are the foreign workers.
16939,In my firm the only guys on true expat packages are the most senior.
16940,Why do maids have to be treated like slaves...
16941,"To the people who are saying “it’s not the agent’s fault”, I would argue that most agents allow latent racism to seep into their responses to Indian tenants."
16942,Too many stories of racism nowadays.
16943,Like once one VTL falls others will follow suit to impose extra restrictions or cancel the VTLs.
16944,Really wonder why the media seems so eager to keep pushing the idea that there is a crap ton of racism in Singapore?
16945,The last thing we need is the media drumming up hate for the Chinese by constantly painting them as privileged racists.
16946,Is that just as racist or does it mean something else?
16947,"It's an interesting perspective, certainly the expats I've mixed with here that have PR don't consider themselves Singporean, on the whole."
16948,"I don't know (m)any expat families without a helper, or even multiple helpers."
16949,I know someone whose a closeted racist and dislikes Filipinos cause they feel that they are too arrogant.
16950,You the guy who people got salty about calling yourself an expat?
16951,"Recently got a WA message complaining that foreign workers getting food like fish and vege with some gravy, but they were throwing them away because ""there wasn't enough curry""."
16952,what boggles my mind was that the Japanese had an expensive expat package which would make Singaporeans the attractive/cheaper option.
16953,Recently there has been a spate of borderline racist comments being given a lot of awards and upvotes.
16954,"I instinctively knew this was racist, and tried to let my friends understand."
16955,"Recently with all the talk about racism in Singapore, the issue of [SAP schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Assistance_Plan) has come up a lot."
16956,This can be classified as a form of systemic racism.
16957,"Recently, I have noticed a lot of people politicising the decisions being made by the government with regards to travel restrictions (or lack there-of)."
16958,"Recently, I've been reading some articles on therealsingapore.com about foreign talents not on their best behavior."
16959,"So the question is, as a foreign talent reading such articles, what comes to mind?"
16960,"Before we dive into actual representation in terms of seats, it is important for us to take a look at national census (and the proportionality of CMIO citizens) from the period of 1970-2010:  Singapore Census 1970: 77.0% C, 23.0% MIO Singapore Census 1980: 78.3% C, 21.7% MIO Singapore Census 1990: 77.8% C, 22.2% MIO Singapore Census 2000: 76.8% C, 23.2% MIO Singapore Census 2010: 74.1% C, 25.9% MIO  As we can see, overall, the proportion of non-Chinese citizens has increased over the past few decades despite a slight dip in the period from 1970-1990."
16961,"Singapore, to be fair, has loads of charities for numerous causes, from protecting vulnerable women and sexual assault survivors to migrant workers to elderly healthcare and so on."
16962,"---  **A- or B+:** HOME (A-), SG Children's Society (A-), Boys' Town (A-), *Community Foundation of Singapore* (A-), Singapore Breast Cancer Foundation (B+), Free Food For All (B+), Care for the Elderly (A-), Beyond Social Services (A-)  Although HOME *only* scores an A-, mainly due to a relatively low percentage of expenses towards charitable programmes, I would still highly suggest donating to them, given the conditions migrant workers have had to go through and their current, ongoing situation."
16963,Employers would be more careful if they know MOM will check on the maids.
16964,"Geylang and Balestier have been gentrified too, so no issues living there on expat package."
16965,The most upvoted comment refuses to acknowledge there is a problem (and then brings up NS as a fallacy of relative privation) and then another one and other replies suggest we're doing the maids a huge favor by employing them.
16966,Yes its great we're offering maids comparatively competitive pay compared to what they get back home but you'd have thought we could also be a bit more compassionate about it and not assume we own them for the relative pittance we pay them.
16967,Spoiled doesn't begin to describe some Singaporean's attitudes towards maids.
16968,"Reddit's stance on China is fuelled by an insane amount of misinformation, racism and ignorance."
16969,Reddit is mostly expats and travellers before.
16970,"Reddit potatoes can't even speak their mother tongue, they'd die of shock if you asked them to pick up a third language"
16971,Am I eligible to do so under an employment pass?
16972,Reduce the FDW quota and watch their pay go up.
16973,Not too soon after TOP male expat suffering from depression and going through divorce killed his toddler before attempting suicide by crashing his car in MCE.
16974,"Regarding 2), what is the proportion of students taking up a mother tongue that is not their own as a second language?"
16975,"Regarding immigration and encouraging Singaporean entrepreneurship: Youtube was co-founded by the son of a Bangladeshi immigrant, Apple founded by the son of a Syrian immigrant, PayPal co-founded by a South African immigrant… all of these companies are now American stalwarts."
16976,"Regarding overseas travel, I think VTL is the way to go forward, and maybe with mandatory boosters to reduce infection rate, they can also completely or partially use ART test kits to cut the cost of testing."
16977,"Regarding taxes, I was in Singapore as an expat and my company paid an accounting firm to take care of them for me both in the US and Singapore."
16978,"From my personal experiences, I've met a lot less racism / other forms of discrimination from teenagers and generally younger generation while it seems the elderly and the older generation habor distaste towards other races."
16979,"Regarding the fiasco from OkLetsGo, should we put misogyny on the same level as racism?"
16980,Just like how you can report to the police for someone making racist remarks.
16981,Those are exactly the racist beliefs that some of us are criticising.
16982,Or for that matter travel restrictions.
16983,"Regardless of what you think of the reserved presidency, if a minority president isn't allowed to ask questions about racism then who is?"
16984,"I know there’s friends/influencers who probably give no fucks about this issue (not to say they are racists but perhaps they don’t understand fully what is going on, don’t get the importance of BLM and are not passionate about this subject) but still chime in on the movement but like i said, i really believe that support is support no matter what, and we should just put that aside for now and be glad that so many people are amplifying black voices all over the world."
16985,Regardless of your thoughts on expats this is bad.
16986,I feel like this is not just an expat thing.
16987,The ops comment condemns racism and makes a very substantive point about hypocrites who claim to denounce overt racist acts but simultaneously are fine with systemic discrimination.
16988,"This mindset definitely qualifies as racist(or maybe islamophobia is the appropriate nomenclature)by any sane definition, but to some it’s just good ol’ pragmatism."
16989,"The racist attitudes held by people like the landlord is more   prevalent that you think, he’s not an outlier."
16990,"Relevant part of his speech (source: CNA):-  >Second point, the obligations relating to Movement of Natural Persons in CECA, as in all FTAs, are not broad principles with wide applications, but actually highly specific."
16991,">So if immigration had not been carved out, and National Treatment principle had been incorporated into Chapter 9 of CECA, then indeed, Indian workers would have to be treated like Singaporeans and would have had free rein to come to live and work in Singapore."
16992,"Except that there is a strong immigration carve-out and National Treatment is not found in Chapter 9 of CECA, nor any other corresponding chapter in the FTAs that Singapore has entered into."
16993,"Contrary to PSP’s claim, our ability to impose requirements for immigration and work pass has never been in question in CECA or any other FTAs that we have signed."
16994,">Instead, then what are the obligations of Chapter 9 of CECA?"
16995,>Such a commitment on duration is not something unique to CECA because similar commitments exist in other FTAs and are also found in the WTO Agreement signed by 164 members including Singapore.
16996,>Let me also specifically address two aspects of the chapter on Movement of Natural Persons in CECA that has been singled out for criticism.
16997,">First, the PSP pointed out that CECA listed 127 categories of professionals and hence claimed that Indian nationals in these professions can all freely come here to work for a year."
16998,The maid is super strong and competent and understands the routine of our entire family very well.
16999,Moreover my father is very overweight and I don't think there's many maids who have such strength and techniques to handle him.
17000,Had a maid that brought her BF in while family was on holiday because she thought my grandma was senile.
17001,Remember what Lee Kuan Yew said on foreign talent in Singapore:  https://youtube.com/watch?v=NxX-tWksVaw
17002,Remember when they said Trump was a racist who would never win?
17003,Remind me again: how does Singapore benefit from the immigration clauses in CECA?
17004,Or is the immigration part of CECA a concession for some other benefit?
17005,"Reminded me of the [Bedok double murder](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/bedok-double-murder-indonesian-maid-serving-20-years-jail-in-home-country-062531740.html), which also involved an Indonesian maid who fled Singapore after her murder."
17006,Have we gone so far back in our society to believe we are superior that those maids?
17007,....you said it’s not good to say it but you just said it yourself”  “this is within this room”    mind fucked so much racism and mental gymnastics.
17008,Repeat after me: There's no racism in Singapore.
17009,> At the risk of wading into a messy discourse - would the context that LMW continued to claim that free movement of persons was used as a bargaining chip in negotiations (implying that there is something wrong with CECA's position on free movement of persons in 127 sectors) change your assessment?
17010,">  > To further clarify - if the issue is a misunderstanding of CECA (as OYK mentioned in his response to LMW, referencing Helen Poa's queries), then I think a charitable interpretation of PSP's position on CECA (i.e."
17011,"But if contextual clues suggest that PSP (or at least, LMW) does not merely misunderstand CECA, then is it fair to continue to affix a charitable interpretation of the claim that ""free movement"" should be interpreted within FTA confines?"
17012,Discriminating someone on racial basis should not be conveniently put as their 'choice' when this by definition is racism.
17013,"Not to jump to conclusions, but this might explain why the dorm numbers are still not under control even after rather draconian measures on migrant worker freedom-of-movement."
17014,"Reproduced from the post:  Part 1/2      ***   CN: Online harassment, reference to violence  I’ve been questioned multiple times over the last few weeks about why I do the kind of reporting I do on migrant workers’ experiences, and I’ve also received questions about the veracity of my claims, the photos I share, etc."
17015,"While many friends and strangers have reached out to say that they find my reporting valuable and extended a lot of solidarity, I’ve also, unsurprisingly, become the target of hate campaigns, including sexist and racist attacks."
17016,"This could be migrant workers, NGOs, experts in various capacities or others working on the frontlines."
17017,"When I receive a report, I do my best to triangulate it with other sources and my own understanding of the situation formed over years of reading, writing, volunteering, and building relationships in the migrant workers’ rights space."
17018,"**However, Ms Sarah has shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”."
17019,She characterised this incident as “racist”.
17020,"** In her interview with Walid J. Abdullah, she also insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”."
17021,Respecting the opinions of racists?
17022,"I remember her, she was invited to my school (as part of the curriculum to introduce to us various charities and NGOs) to give a talk about H.O.M.E (the shelter she runs for abused migrant economics (maids/foreign workers)) and she moved us to the point that we turned the small cash donation drive for the level into a big food donation movement that spanned the whole school (as they were in urgent need of supplies more then)."
17023,Rest of world opening fully and these jokers  still insisting on VTL bs
17024,"Trump might cite my work, but he overlooks my findings that the influx of immigrants can potentially be a net good for the nation, increasing the total wealth of the population."
17025,Clinton ignores the hard truth that not everyone benefits when immigrants arrive.
17026,"For many Americans, the influx of immigrants hurts their prospects significantly."
17027,"Even after the economy has fully adjusted, those skill groups that received the most immigrants will still offer lower pay relative to those that received fewer immigrants."
17028,tldr: Bringing immigrants grows the overall economy.
17029,I don't see how this is 'SJW whining' when this is a legitimate issue about how trolls like to use their anonymity to write blatantly racist shit when the family is going through this traumatic situation.
17030,"Singapore always feel like a something simmering underneath when casual racism is really common, especially among the older residents."
17031,Wonder how the VTLs will be impacted by this new variant.
17032,Rich people (main con employers of these foreign workers) will be affected by rule change.
17033,As bad as the ones that try to make it seem like xenophobia is somehow better than racism
17034,Right because the real issue here isn’t the racist landlord or the harm it does to minorities.
17035,It’s your specific form of racism and whether this particular incident is that particular type of racism.
17036,Right because there was no racism in Singapore before the internet as Western influence.
17037,"Most maids and construction workers are not human beings anyway, no?"
17038,We aren't the first in imposing snap border closures and restrictions and others have gone with much more extreme measures.
17039,Though i do believe that our examples are straying off quite far from the actual scenario that the actress was asked for her preferences on kissing indians   Yet again i have mentioned before that we can't label the Director as a racist without knowing his intentions.
17040,"The question is whether he was initially a CECA immigrant, and even if he was, whether the organizers knew this or simply assumed he was because of his race."
17041,"Right, so you can either come to SG and look for work, or apply remotely, maybe get a fly out interview, and then get an employment pass approved before you land to start work."
17042,"Right, thats why taxi uncle in parliament cries CECA but barely complains about any other trade agreement"
17043,"If a FDW is hired for a specific job, ensure they aren't forced to do other work - fatigue and frustration leads to lash outs like this."
17044,Provide adequate training (on Singapore's dollar) for FDWs who need to take on nurse-like responsibilities.
17045,Increase time-off and living conditions of FDWs such that is on par with what a Singaporean would be comfortable with.
17046,Right..    https://www.dictionary.com/browse/xenophobia  &    https://www.dictionary.com/browse/racism  The discrimination here is towards China’s Chinese and not towards our locals.
17047,So basically racism doesn’t apply as prejudice views against China’s Chinese isn’t towards Chinese as a whole.
17048,"Which is why I've been telling a lot of my American and British friends who know people who are a bit too anti-inclusionary for survivable comfort, that they ought to invite those people to spend a few years here in Singapore, as locals rather than on any sort of expat package."
17049,"(Lol, we are kinda racist, it really is a ""white"" premium, hence listed separately from being American)  Edit: as you can see from the posts, there is a certain bias to the schools being mentioned - the reality is for tech & Asia, your baseline comparisons are USA: Stanford, Singapore: Insead."
17050,Role of expats in singapore: Transitional and Transactional.
17051,"Rosdiana told the maid that her husband would not be interested as the victim's breast was ""small unlike hers""."
17052,I know that Myanmar FDW pretty much starved to death but seems like a bit of a bandaid solution versus root cause?
17053,It’s basically saying “if you starve your FDW we’ll find out eventually!”
17054,I don't agree with the hate and xenophobia but to a certain extent I can understand why people would feel hard done by if this was my country although clearly this isn't a valid excuse for the abuse.
17055,S Iswaran's bulletproof VTL plan to restart air links in shambles
17056,S pass workers are totally irrelevant to the CECA debate.
17057,(VTL)  Vs  S$3.30 for SG2MY + RM3.40 for MY2SG = ~S$4.50.
17058,"You can definitely tell that some are racist, but I think there are far fewer than one expect."
17059,SAP schools only offer Chinese as a mother tongue.
17060,"If I'm not wrong, at one point in time it was compulsory for students to take the mother tongue corresponding to their parents' race."
17061,"SAP schools, EIP in Housing policy, Linguistic prejudice for Mandarin over other mother tongues..."
17062,SAP students who graduate and went on to local unis are educated and still racist as hell
17063,"SCMP definitely has their agenda with their news articles... Just need to go in with eyes wide open, but doesn't mean we can't agree with the broad strokes of the article, mainly that our migrant workers are treated like shit even till today."
17064,"SEA games medallist, preferential treatment, no comments on Bumi, come SG, landlord only wants ""ang mohs and japs"", say whole of Singapore has ""rampant"" and ""explicit"" racism against minorities."
17065,"You were born Chinese, and thus your mother tongue that you have to learn (and suffer) is Mandarin, not Melayu or Tamil, etc."
17066,SG Chinese: Stereotyping and making fun of all Chinese with dog meat is racist.
17067,Also SG Chinese: Stereotyping and making fun of all Indians with curry is not racist.
17068,"Only thing different is the political situation, but that does not directly concern expats."
17069,There will be fringe expats in both countries that care about politics but most don't.
17070,"I do agree though, that the longer the situation stays, the more difficult it gets for expats."
17071,It boils down to whether the expats have deeper roots in either countries.
17072,SG chinese- there is no racism in Singapore/ stop overblowing the issue  Also SG chinese- wah don't go Australia or country X to study/work because they are so racist when they commit the same behavior
17073,"Our migrant workers need not beg for food and they're getting paid, getting food & shelter & medical care while in quarantine, while the job is still there for them as SG still needs them."
17074,"Most expats live around Bukit Timah, Novena/Newton and Kallang areas because there are many rentals available."
17075,"I have expat frens who chose to stay in public housing (HDB) in Redhill, Queenstown and Holland Village."
17076,"U can join the Expat forum  https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewforum.php?f=3  Believe there is a Facebook group too  Many will be happy to furnish info on relocation, visa, taxation etc"
17077,SG is racist as fuck.
17078,Only thing is if it's against the majority it's called racism.
17079,"My prediction is early April in line with Malaysia, we'll scrap VTLs and allow the fully vaxxed in with 24 hour arrival ART."
17080,"SG version of racism = annoying neighbours, insensitive social media remarks  US version of racism = people died  If you survive in the US as a minority, you’d be fine here."
17081,Yet they don't get criticised like Indian nationals and CECA.
17082,"SGporean working overseas - I'm definitely not considered as an ""expat"", more of an  ""a legal alien"" - it's not bump-free, but it's definitely better than fighting with ""expats"" in SG for a job."
17083,SIN - CPH is already a VTL flight and can get you to the rest of Sweden via SAS (or train) quickly.
17084,"Since campaigning began on July 1, opposition candidates have been taken to task under the law over comments made on three issues; government spending for foreign students, plans to grow the city-state’s 5.7 million population to 10 million, and government advisories that discouraged COVID-19 testing for foreign workers."
17085,SINGAPORE - A maid who wanted to work for another household deliberately dipped the hand of her employer's 16-month-old baby into a pot of hot water after finding out that she would have to incur costs for a transfer.
17086,The maid started working for the family on Dec 8 last year.
17087,"After two weeks, the maid decided she wanted to work elsewhere as she did not know how to care for the baby."
17088,The maid was cooking chicken curry on Jan 14 this year in the family flat in the Buangkok area when the baby started crying at around 5.15pm.
17089,A closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera in the flat captured the maid committing the offence.
17090,The victim's sister stepped out of a bathroom when she heard the cry but the maid claimed the baby had placed her hand inside the pot.
17091,But the father became suspicious the next day when the maid said that she wanted to stop working for the household.
17092,He viewed the CCTV clip with his spouse and saw the maid committing the offence.
17093,"When confronted with the video evidence, the maid finally confessed that she had hurt the baby on purpose."
17094,"On Wednesday, DPP Lim pressed for at least 16 months' jail for the maid and told District Judge Ong Chin Rhu that the case involved ""a very vulnerable victim""."
17095,She told the court that the maid had worked for seven days a week with no days off.
17096,The maid cannot be caned as she is a woman.
17097,"SINGAPORE - The sole coronavirus case in the community on Friday  (March 26) was a 26-year-old Myanmar national employed as a foreign  domestic worker here, said the Ministry of Health (MOH)."
17098,"Following her SHN, she moved into a boarding house for foreign  domestic workers while waiting for deployment to an employer, and had  not left the boarding house from Feb 6 to March 23."
17099,"And some go even further to play the racial card to divide our society,”  Does the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) allow firms to hire Indian professionals in Singapore without valid work passes, or without adhering to fair employment guidelines?"
17100,The CECA DOES NOT allow firms to hire Indian nationals to work in Singapore without a valid work pass.
17101,"SINGAPORE — The sole proprietor of an employment agency was fined the maximum of S$5,000 on Thursday (July 12), after she admitted to bringing in a 13-year-old girl from Myanmar to work as a foreign domestic worker in July 2017."
17102,"The girl's passport stated that she was 23 years old, the minimum age set by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for foreign domestic workers."
17103,Khor's agency was the second offender in two months to be convicted for bringing in an underage maid.
17104,"Last month, Casa Employment Services was also fined S$5,000 after pleading guilty to bringing in a 14-year-old Burmese maid."
17105,"Similarly, Casa Employment relied solely on information provided by their own overseas agent, without conducting its own checks to verify the maid's age."
17106,The two underage maids have been sent back to Myanmar and barred from seeking employment in Singapore.
17107,"In the last three years, the MOM has taken enforcement action against at least 98 employment agencies for failing to ensure that the foreign domestic workers whom they place met the age requirement."
17108,"On Thursday, the court further heard that Khor usually interviewed foreign domestic workers from Indonesia through Skype before processing their applications, as she knew Bahasa Indonesia."
17109,"The girl knew that the date of birth on her passport was inaccurate, but was told by her agent that the minimum required age to work in Singapore as a domestic worker was 23 years old."
17110,He also argued that his client thought the maid was taller than most Myanmar women.
17111,"SINGAPORE — Upset that her three domestic workers were not carrying out their tasks to her satisfaction, a grandmother got them to slap one another on the face as punishment, and even had them pour water over one another until they were drenched."
17112,"On Thursday (March 12), Kan Choi Yit, 62, pleaded guilty to two charges of instigating the domestic workers to voluntarily cause hurt to each other, and another charge of instigating them to intentionally use force to annoy each other."
17113,"The court heard that the foreign domestic workers involved were two women directly employed by Kan: Filipino Annabel Timbol Reyes, now aged 26, and Indonesian Ratna Lestari, now aged 25."
17114,"&#x200B;  ‘NO RIGHT’ TO METE OUT PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT  &#x200B;  In asking for a lighter sentence for Kan, defence lawyer Justin Chan said that his client would typically get her domestic workers to write out lines many times if they committed some error, as a reminder not to do it again."
17115,He also added that none of the domestic workers had personally filed a complaint with the Ministry of Manpower about how they were treated.
17116,"However, DPP Gwee pointed out that this was victim-blaming and that as domestic workers, they are in a vulnerable position."
17117,"See how some places like minorityvoices on IG say ""swipe to read journalists mansplaining racism"" while reposting kirsten's content lambasting LHZB when it clearly isnt a man justifying any form of discrimination against women."
17118,Sad to learn about the many maid suicides in Singapore...
17119,I believe Singapore Govt can do better for these migrant workers as they also play a very important role in the growth and development of the nation.
17120,"Sad to see the mentality that "" I paid for maid, I own her"" still existing."
17121,Or similar to maids they can only buy up to x amount?
17122,Sadge the govt fucked the employer instead by using the weird law treating the maid like a product instead of a foreign employee.
17123,"Assuming that he and his family did try to cover up and misaccuse the maid, I wonder if he could end up in jail?"
17124,Sadly people brought up in traditional Chinese families tend to be secretly racist.
17125,"I have a friend who I thought was really nice until I heard her making a very racist remark one day, I was so aghast and asked her where she'd heard that from."
17126,"And no, I am NOT saying that only Singaporean Chinese are racist."
17127,Sadly the “one foreign worker” is willing to work 12hrs or more a day while the local can’t because of life’s responsibility.
17128,Sadly this is not uncommon even among the non-racist in the US.
17129,And Singaporeans are xenophobic.
17130,"There's a lot of institutional racism in sg that I can rant about for days, but throwing the racist card straight off the bat for this incident makes me go hurmmmm...."
17131,All these people will not be Singapore's long term problem looking at the shitty migrant worker rights here.. Can't work?
17132,"Sadly, that is how expats view Singlish."
17133,"Sadly, there are people who got X-ray eye to see maid abuse, but never report."
17134,A friend of mine recently complained about maids overcrowding Orchard Road on Sundays.
17135,"I hate crowded areas too, but it's not the maids' fault that they want to enjoy their day off in town."
17136,"3) the alternative is to convert all these expats into independent Contractors, not employees."
17137,In the form of xenophobia or a hatred towards younger people.
17138,"As an SG Chinese myself, I believe the more non-Chinese friends you have and know, like other Malays & Indians, the less of a racist sentiment you would harbor."
17139,Wouldn't that be more of social classes prejudice rather than racism?
17140,"It's not really racism, tbf, but it's completely playing into colonial stereotypes where Caucasian ppl are supposed to have connections and be the real high-ranking officials."
17141,My experience with racism in my formative years was strangely more rampant in my non-SAP pri sch than my SAP sec sch.
17142,"Although it was a maisonette with a proper maid room downstairs, not store room as we also got store room."
17143,"If she's done with her work she can do whatever she wants, etc   There really should be a system for employers where agencies can have the right to refuse to let you hire a maid if there were reports prior which state with proper proof that you have abused your maid"
17144,"Same here, had an English expat that works at one of the big tech companies and after news of the open lane to Germany, he told us about his travel plans to Denmark via Germany."
17145,I hate when people call me expat.
17146,"It makes it look like if you are high ses you are an expat, otherwise, you are an immigrant/foreign worker."
17147,My workplace won't even let me go back to office for the first week even if I take VTL so makes no difference to me.
17148,Same like: 'I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology'
17149,"Sadly it's not so much about xenophobia, as a Singaporean I can honestly admit that we are not keeping up with new immigrants, and that's why the natural born citizens are resentful."
17150,"Same situation with the expat community at the moment, a lot of senior ones here with their families aren't really fussed with the closed borders."
17151,"Who can help us, poor soldiers forced into conscription to protect the country, but paid an allowance lower than foreign workers?"
17152,"Ppl foreign workers help build Singapore, we NSF also help protect Singapore."
17153,Same when you're a non Chinese immigrant living in China.
17154,Once VTL opens I'm out of here for sure
17155,"Same, I was so horrified and disappointed to see my wise and kind mum (who I look up to a lot) turning into this xenophobic and inhumane person, as this whole Covid situation develops."
17156,Dad has always been xenophobic so I'm not surprised lol.
17157,"Literally walked out of a conversation with her this morning, as she started talking about how migrant workers are getting too 'spoilt' because the govt and NGOs keep helping them out, and neglecting the locals."
17158,"If that's the reason, then be mad at the govt lah, don't blame the migrant workers for receiving whatever help they needed :("
17159,"While we are at it, the super duper racist McDonald’s ad on the samurai burger...."
17160,It's racism in another form.
17161,"Sangeetha is very racist lol, she's been warned by the police before too."
17162,Was an immigrant (or fancy word expat) for a long time before calling home.
17163,If a foreign worker saves the same and needs to minus one-time cost of 'agent fee' which can go 3-6 months in commission does it make sense to come here?
17164,"That dude then approached this Indonesian lady (I presumed she is a maid), introduced himself, told her that she is pretty and asked for her number."
17165,"Saw someone share this on my Facebook, calling for Singaporeans to WAKE UP to the detrimental racism in our society."
17166,"I find our ""tolerant racism"" very unique to Singapore and somehow help our multi-racial society function."
17167,"Also, I think people who mistreat their maids has nothing to do with race, but has everything to do with the employers being absolute scum,   What do you guys think?"
17168,Insurance agents that employs a 3rd party foreign worker to bait people into going to them.
17169,Does those foreign workers have a work permit to do this?
17170,"&nbsp;  These foreign workers are typically young ladies and they will firstly confirm if you are a local/PR and mention that they are not trying to sell you anything, saying it is not insurance."
17171,"Say if I asked u a question on X race and u gave the wrong answer, are u racist?"
17172,And isn’t it racist to say that a person of different race cannot further the multicultural and multiracial agenda in Singapore and cannot understand other races?
17173,"I have not come across one single migrant worker himself, that has demanded, an apology."""
17174,"Say thanks to MMTF   Draconian covid measures scare away foreign talents, *Surprise Pikachu*"
17175,Saying ang moh's are fuckers and should go home is not racist.
17176,Saying no Indians and PRC's allowed to rent is not racist?
17177,A Malay Singaporean saying the local Chinese are bastards who hold them back is not racist?
17178,A local Chinese saying the local Malay's are lazy or the local tamils are only good for menial jobs is not racist?
17179,"She exudes cynicism and privilege, if there was one thing I’d wish upon her it’s a couple of months in a COVID-19 infected dormitory under the same conditions as the less fortunate members of society."
17180,This comment makes the most sense to me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/mzjcpq/police\_investigating\_alleged\_racism\_and/gw258j2?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/mzjcpq/police_investigating_alleged_racism_and/gw258j2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
17181,"Scold the maid la, scold somemore later maid run away."
17182,Scoot is already flying VTL flights to Germany and Australia.
17183,I would expect the VTLs will remain so long as variants of concern don't become... a concern.
17184,"Search report maid abuse...  https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/report-an-infringement  Take photos, of the maid, of the employer, employer name, bed number, hospital etc."
17185,Easiest would be to get the maids details directly from the maid since u already managed to communicate/give her food.
17186,Second post about racism from this guy already.
17187,My uncle's maid is too far gone already and I have no say.
17188,"See   https://www.instagram.com/p/CP5VvD-FzRz/?utm_medium=copy_link  All SJWs calling LHZB editor ""mansplaining"" racism."
17189,"I honestly think more than actualities, the item that holds back easing of travel restrictions is the will of the people."
17190,It is quite worrying how many people see that a travel ban would be considered xenophobic.
17191,See this is why it isn't bad to be an expat.
17192,"good of you to at least concede that CECA was always a canard, the real target/issue was always something else."
17193,"Besides, this discussion is on the general tone of the sub, and not individual topics like xenophobia."
17194,Seeing how all the employers are making recent headlines for maid-abuse in various violent and inhumane ways.
17195,"Look at some of their atrocities done onto their maids, can even match SISI liao in terms of violating human rights."
17196,"I mean would terror groups prefer to hire the 'violent and easily triggered, abusive employers' or 'some foreign domestic worker who are usualy harmless'?"
17197,"Seeing some of the comments here, it's better if Singapore stops taking in foreign maids."
17198,&#x200B;  Getting a maid just seems like an excuse to throw all these things on them without accountability.
17199,"Seeing some the comments with people claiming that the hold their maid's passports so that they don't ""skip town"", I cannot help but ask: What century is this?"
17200,"Wouldn't be surprised if SQ announced it this week, given how fast the announcement of SIN-YVR-SEA happened after the Canada / US VTL announcement."
17201,"Unfortunately some of our policies and stifling environment drive some of the best and brightest Singaporeans (and now, expats) away - why not make Sg a TRULY welcoming place for her own people as well as the world, while lifting up those who just need to get by."
17202,I don't have a domestic helper but after reading through what she says about her I understand her POV.
17203,Imagine it being a roommate instead of a domestic helper.
17204,"If it's a roommate I'm pretty sure no one would actually give a fuck about speaking up for her, but just because it's a 'lowly paid domestic helper' suddenly everyone come and become some social justice warrior."
17205,Seems like it's ok because it's the Chinese that is being laughed at and also Chinese are the only racist according to some post here.
17206,"Seems like we gonna just keep looping, because you seem to think that the FTs are perfect beings while the domestic workers aren't."
17207,"Someone can have largely enlightened views, but still hold one racist assumption they aren’t even aware of."
17208,It isn’t helpful to call them “a racist” since that sounds like writing off their whole character.
17209,Yet it also isn’t helpful to say they are “not racist” because then it sounds like a licence not to address the one racist assumption they have.
17210,"We should focus on calling out and addressing racist views, assumptions, actions etc., rather than focusing on the personal virtue of the person expressing/performing them."
17211,Seems this was a yahoo news assignment 🙄  https://sg.style.yahoo.com/singaporeans-reveal-shocking-mistreatment-maids-070321878.html
17212,Sadly the actual bouts of racism will possibly become trivial used as a result.
17213,Seems to me FW isn’t a Govt priority or concern given the lax regulations that led to dormitory disaster.
17214,"Self disclosure here; I’m Chinese, and although I’ve always known there was covert and casual racism, I’ve never known it to be that bad."
17215,"Which is why I felt that the juxtaposition of those 2 posts on this sub was hugely ironic, because on one hand you have over 1k upvotes for a post about the “racist guy in the street”, and yet the post which asked why renters are discriminated on the basis of race was being downvoted to oblivion, with all sorts of people trying to be apologists and justifying how it is not discriminatory to only look at race and nothing else when renting out a unit."
17216,"And you are probably right, maybe many of us might be extremely shocked when racist incidents in public appear right in front of our faces, without realising that such sentiments often breed in our own homes and backyards and that we are also actually responsible for perpetuating such beliefs when we practice race discriminations in rental markets and employment, or defend against such practices in general."
17217,They can afford to get a maid but cant afford to get a decent meal for her?
17218,"Never heard anyone says there's no racism against the majority, but here we are, witnessing the emergence of Trump-like characters, the perpetual victims of imaginary circumstances against them."
17219,Why should I stand up against racism when the people I am standing for will not stand up for others in turn?
17220,I am disgusted by how many Muslims scream oppression and racism while at the same time actively condemning and oppressing other groups.
17221,"\[Wahyuwidayat, 2016\] 'Traditional colourism combined with racism, congealed into a toxic mix of ideas that associated European features with power, wealth and status.'"
17222,Nobody is saying send all the expats back.
17223,"Just like the immigration issue, the foreign ""talent"" or expat issue is about fair treatment to locals with similar qualifications to those top jobs."
17224,Serious Q though: how is it inclusive to limit access only to FDWs?
17225,"Many maids have local boyfriends, but they'll be banned from entering."
17226,Serious question -- is there any international court of human rights that can hold the SG government accountable for how they've treated the migrant workers for over 1.5 years?
17227,"Because I don't, and I think it is a major problem when some of our most active local online communities are actively racist and xenophobic."
17228,Is it racism or race preference?
17229,Is it only racism when it does not supports the moral compass or suit your agenda?
17230,Sadly the Prosecution did not apply for seizure and garnishment order to pay the compensation during the original hearing allowing this terrible couple to get away from paying the maid's compensation / salary.
17231,AG should seriously look at this mishap and the State should compensate the maid.
17232,🙄 It’s not like you’re some billionaire or aristocrat or royalty to treat your domestic helper in such a manner....
17233,"That & HWZ EDMW both compete for being the most racist, xenophobic & just short of nazi level hatred."
17234,All i can say is hope the Gov relax the rules (they did a bit for FDW from Indonesia where they can SHN at Employer homes + easier travel approvals) and let the FDW enter the country with Vaccine + PCR negative.
17235,"Want to make Singapore a COVID-endemic country, but you fucking lock up the migrant workers in their dorms?"
17236,"Seriously, is it normal to ask maids (if you have them) to switch the air conditioners on for you?"
17237,"VTLs are a Singapore specific invention, that was supposed to be a temporary measure."
17238,"With everyone vaccinated and boosted, and with 10+k mild or asymptomatic cases per day (real number probably at least 2x higher), what's the point of continuing with VTLs exactly?"
17239,"Seriously... this gets upvoted just because it plays to the young crowd on here, despite it being so easy to find cases of younger ppl abusing their maids?"
17240,https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/some-singapores-worst-maid-abusers  7 out of 9 cases in the above article from 2015 are aged 40 and below.
17241,In fact if you just google “Singapore maid abuse cases” the very first result (i.e.

17251,Shan is just a closet boomer racist himself.
17252,">""If everyone starts discussing race and religion in the way they did, you will in fact get more racism, not less."
17253,Isn't that racism?
17254,Ignore because they don't have the right to chase after you but do inform that the maid is no longer staying at your residence.
17255,Walao eh might as well donate it to help those migrant workers get better condition.
17256,She deserves to live all her remaining days in the same way she treated her maid.
17257,She did not ill-treat her maid.
17258,"Our government has been open about paying attention to the race of potential immigrants, with the sole intent of 'preserving the racial balance' (ie making sure total percentage of Chinese people doesn't fall below a certain number) of the country."

17268,She is ruining it for the other domestic workers with legitimate cases.
17269,"Have a relative working in a maid agency, not uncommon to hear they have their own group chats to teach other maids how to get transferred to a ""better"" household."
17270,"She is still subject to racist BS whenever someone online calls her makcik, or makes a crack about her tudung."
17271,"This kind of problematic framing of people's neutral examination of the issue at hand as being tied to ""not recognising existence of racism""(which is SJWs' main focus of contention) is a really low blow to fostering a conducive environment for freedom of speech."
17272,"She made it sound like the Chinese community in Singapore was going out of their way to discriminate against the minority races when in reality, it was a landlord discriminating in favour of expat races, presumably because they are perceived as having deeper pockets and willing to pay more for accommodation."
17273,"She may be a minority in Singapore but in the great context of the Nusantara region, she is a majority and therefore capable of being racist."
17274,She may have stopped being a maid abuser but she will always be a maid killer.
17275,She may not be racist but she's obviously a bad version of a human.
17276,She mentioned that no migrant worker demanded an apology.
17277,Lol which migrant worker would even dare to do that in front of her.

17279,It could mean the general public is racist that it needs to be asked.
17280,She must have been very proud she can afford a maid then get big headed.
17281,There must be silent transmission still going around in these foreign worker dormitories.
17282,She said that she is not racist because she won't talk to rank-and-file Chinese too.
17283,That is maid abuse too and the employers should get some consequences too.
17284,"All the maids under my family always grow fat from being able to eat whatever they want and eating the precise same meal we eat if it suits her taste, she gets first dips since she's cooking it."
17285,"And I think for all the hard work a maid does, keeping her well fed is at least the bare minimum."
17286,That's what she thought was enough for her maid.
17287,She started the charity when it wasn’t cool to help migrant workers.
17288,She went back to being a non-maid abuser??
17289,Well maybe it's because she don't have a maid to abuse?
17290,We have massive a expat community with the largest concentration of MNCs so it tells us something.
17291,She's a beacon of light for racist toxic people lor

17299,"“It seems like they only take the most serious ones to hospital; the normal ones like me, no one takes care of us.”   The situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up one-third of the labor force."
17300,"Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes."
17301,A worker on a dormitory balcony.
17302,Workers hang out in a dormitory compound.
17303,"“This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don’t exist,” Au said."

17317,A metorite could strike your domestic worker.
17318,"Singaporeans are not allowed to be racist because it is illegal, but deep down, many of us are still racist af."
17319,"Shit was so bad, the maid had to climb down 15 storeys."
17320,Shit wouldn't happen if we housed migrant workers separately without cramping them in fucking domitories.
17321,How things would be better if each of us could take a migrant worker to stay with us in a hdb household...
17322,"My plans are still on with the above contingencies but if a scenario of border closures in my destination countries materializes, I'll have to cancel them obviously, so just mentally prepared for that."
17323,"But there are varying levels of xenophobia, spread out between races, religions, social status and their nationality."
17324,Your social sphere can expand to more than just your English-speaking expat bubble.
17325,"Short of going down this road of discussing about cultural differences, just one point I'd like to make:  The PAP did not foresee CECA's impact on Singaporeans who lost their jobs since 2005 till now."
17326,"With only 4 days of campaigning left until Sep 11, the PAP has actually not shown it understands people's problems and objections, with the CECA as one of the problems that had its start years before 2003 when George Yeo tabled it."
17327,"But now, ITS GONE and the price is hmmm... racist?"
17328,"Short term expats (<6 months) pay a higher income tax while the longer term expats pay a similar income tax, but are not eligible for many of the tax deductions, govt subsidies, healthcare benefits, etc applicable to local Singaporeans and pay a significantly higher property tax."
17329,Short term visitors (and unvaccinated) can still come to Singapore under familial ties on a non VTL flight.
17330,Our country is exploiting these foreign workers
17331,Please also cite sources for PR approvals based on ethnicity.
17332,Should get a lifetime ban on maids.
17333,"Sure it may not totally change their racist mindset, but they generally have a better perspective of our minority races."
17334,Should show the trend before and after CECA implemented to be conclusive.
17335,Should strip him naked and parade him through orchard road with a gaggle of domestic workers ringing bells.
17336,"When we have [such rules](https://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20110118-258823.html), I dunno if people treating maids as lesser are really few and far between."
17337,Should we take the view that every black athlete representing US supports anti-black racism or Donald trump’s racial rhetoric?
17338,The current land VTL numbers are a joke
17339,Shouldn't this the case for all FDWs?
17340,Some of the outbreaks in these two places were also linked to expats that didn't give a hoot about restrictions (e.g.
17341,The reason expats are here was never about no restrictions or freedom.
17342,Show me the statistics that justify anti-immigrant or/and Muslim sentiment in EU.
17343,Why do you have an impression that the bystanders or majority think racism is acceptable in Singapore?
17344,Shutting down SAP to reduce racism isn’t even a solution.
17345,Avg cost of the houses are > 5Mil :|  Hopefully the FDW can find another job with a human employer.
17346,"If we were to handle these expats the way their countries handle foreign talents, they will start a protest of their own in front of Istana."
17347,I think it's time we curb this whole domestic helpers industry.
17348,"And if you reply me: “but Chinese are the ones in the privilege position, you guys don’t get to complain about racism”, think about those words for a bit and tell me if you’re being hypocritical."
17349,"Sidenote: Can we just let the term ""expat"" die now?"
17350,"Sigh even if you don’t agree that the situation is racist, the PA did not do anything right here."
17351,If they bothered to read r/sg they would come across harrowing tales of racism faced by people who had their fortunes stolen by the silly mistake of buying nasi pandang.

17354,Not every expat will get their dream job in NY or London or wherever else it’s going to be.

17356,These events isn’t going to change that fact which is why there will be expats that will continue to come out here when the time comes.
17357,"If you really believe that this incident is going to cause a major dry up in expats coming to SG and HK, then I don’t really know what else to say."
17358,You think that a business owner who thinks he can make money in Asia isn’t going to come here when the time comes just because of how expats are being treated?
17359,"And to be clear, it’s not a situation where expats are being treated in an inhumane fashion necessarily."
17360,"I remember seeing a post from awhile back where someone asked about being black in Singapore, and the answers seemed to suggest either (a) the racism is not directed at black people, (b) there aren't enough black people in SG to even really say either way, or (c) nationality trumped race."
17361,"[The English-Only Movement ](https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/english-only)   >Perhaps it is your opinion that this practice is xenophobic but saying such things without providing any substantial evidence, and accusing others of being xenophobic, name calling others in this thread as racist - is all extremely unnecessary and counter productive to anyone with proper suggestions and points to contribute."
17362,"And even for your example of Australia having language tests, it's highly criticised as a xenophobic move."
17363,"[Aussie language test ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-10/australian-partner-visa-english-language-rule-budget/12743534)  I mean, you're probably going to send me an angry reply again, telling me that I'm not realistic or letting my personal bias cloud my judgement."
17364,"Don't just dismiss comments on the sub just because they've called people out for being racist or xenophobic, if you're truly up for a discussion, then keep an open mind and try to understand why there are people who would use these terms."
17365,"I mean, if at the end of the day, with all these people telling you that the idea is xenophobic but you can still tell yourself that it isn't then you can sleep easy."
17366,Sucks to be maid in Singapore.
17367,It is literally illegal for foreign workers to change employers.
17368,"A foreign worker might come here to work for an employer, but turns out by the time he gets here, his employer gives him different terms and different job scope."
17369,"But foreign workers cannot, it is literally illegal under MOM’s laws to do this."
17370,Catch up with foreign talents.
17371,"It's not racist, simply because we say so."

17375,Simi mermaid so much plastic.
17376,Simisai also racist  It's the new 'kua simi kua'
17377,"Another reason is that unlike us, idiots posting racist content online are not prosecuted, so it gives the impression that they are more racist than we perceive them to be, and the fact that racism is usually swept under the carpet by the government isn't helping."
17378,"That said, I am not implying that racism levels are lower or higher outside the country."
17379,"In my opinion (which is not 100% flawless, as are of anyone's opinion), direct racism is more prevalent in UK or US, and casual racism is more common in SG, probably as we don't really adhere to the ""political correctness"" culture."
17380,"I would say""Uncle,ok lets settle this, let me call the police and let him be the judge on who is a racist, you or me."
17381,Simply because we are mindful of race does not mean we are racist.
17382,"Yes, we are racist to a certain extent (we are also slightly biased against our poorer Asian counterparts, and generally prefer whites) but I think you are jumping to a lot of conclusions (that MAY be right) without understanding Singapore's history and background."
17383,"Now, the first thing that came to my mind was ""How racist can we be to Caucasians??""."
17384,"Honestly, White prestige is a thing here so if you wish to complain that we're being racist against Whites by leaving them out in our rental notices and ignore the prestige you enjoy in other areas.. well."
17385,"If my Hokkien speaking grandmother wants to rent out her one bedroom to a Chinese female over a white/Chinese/Malay/Indian English-speaking male I would not be surprised, or feel like she was being racist."
17386,If you think all it takes to remove racism is to make sure rental notices are non-discriminatory maybe you are being too narrow-minded.
17387,"You seem to go on and on in your replies about how racism is not acceptable ANYWHERE like it's some universal mantra we should all live by but COME ON, different cultures exist and they are more complicated than you can initially imagine."
17388,"You might call it racism but I call it being pragmatic, so who's right?"
17389,"Through your liberal lenses MAYBE we're being old-fashion and xenophobic, but look at the bigger picture."
17390,Simply because we as Chinese do not suffer in any part except our bruised ego and lost face when the minorities are racist to us.
17391,"When we the majority are racist to the minorities, they cannot just shake it off as just words."
17392,"If there is anything else I might have to offer, it's that people's anecdotal experiences play a large part in whether they are more disposed to racism."
17393,"The PAP has traditionally been in favour of joining Singapore with the wider world, whether it be through free trade and accepting immigrants, and integrating ourselves with ASEAN."
17394,"Since NSFs and migrant workers all have to do it, let's also make all civilians, old people and babies do it!"
17395,/s  Obviously like it has been pointed out -  it's a win-win if such standards get enforced for even migrant workers.
17396,"Since quite a lot of people are asking why is there a need to confine the foreign workers to their dorm, let me explain in detail."
17397,"It is much, much larger than foreign worker dormitories."
17398,"If anyone of your online friends is claiming to be a FDW and needs a couple thousand dollars to be ""released"", please do your own DD before blindly giving them cash."
17399,Since when I say it is racist ?
17400,"Since when did xenophobia depend on race , not nationality?"
17401,Since you have a fixed date then it can’t be helped… or like what others said maybe you can look into non VTL flights.
17402,Maybe the grandparents also want to go for a holiday via VTL leh.
17403,"If you bother to read the article, the kid obviously wanted to go holiday with her parents and not want to live independently or whatever bs you are spouting, they could have choose the option of travelling via non VTL"
17404,Since you mentioned it - please be nice to your maids.
17405,"Since you want to compare:   If you think Malaysian Chinese are fucking racist, I'll introduce you to the extremist Malaysian Malays and you'll see how the extremist Chinese pales in comparison to the extremist Malays."
17406,"Since you want to harp on education, immigrants should be educating themselves on the norms, cultures and laws of the host country."
17407,"Yes, racism is a public issue."
17408,"When I read about Esther Low being asked if she's ok to kiss an Indian guy, I can also hear the racist bullshit my relatives sprout and the underlying implication that there are still people out there who think the way my racist relatives do."
17409,"Ultimately America essentially controls the media (and its much worse back home, that's one of the reasons I wanted to become an expat and get out of that bubble)."
17410,"Since your citizenship is Singaporean, you're actually considered an expatriate in Australia - the other way round!"
17411,International schools are expensive and the crowd are mostly expat's children of a certain social class.
17412,I sincerely believe that my circle of Chinese friends are not racist; honestly we will take Tharman or k.Shan as PM over the current 4G team.
17413,So please believe that not all Chinese Singaporeans are racist.
17414,"Singapore GE2020: The long view on Ceca and other free trade agreements ---  *[Ravi Velloor](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/ravi-velloor) - Associate Editor*  > **The fear of losing jobs to foreigners is valid, but it needs to be addressed with facts, balanced reasoning and empathy**  > Leading up to this month's general election, one issue that won traction was that of the large presence here of foreign workers, particularly the PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) - who are thought to compete with locals for jobs."
17415,"> [ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2020/07/19/st_20200719_rvftadate_5825933.jpg) *Last week's retrenchments at Resorts World Sentosa - and reports that Marina Bay Sands will likely follow suit - have added grist to the mill, that of the large presence here of foreign workers, particularly the PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) who are thought to compete with locals for jobs."
17416,A female Chinese classmate said something racist to me as a joke.
17417,What’s especially interesting is the fact that the first words she chose to speak to me were a racist joke.
17418,Same thing with maids.
17419,My mom had a maid who called police to our home claiming my mom beat her when my mom got upset with her for not completing household chores for the day.
17420,The maid who brought us up loved us so much I still get phone calls from her on my every birthday.
17421,My parents cramp us 3 kids into one room to give the maid her own room with air-conditioning and TV and a queen size bed.
17422,It is not exclusive to maids.
17423,But I do not believe maid abuse is an epidemic here.
17424,As many of my relatives and friends have maids and I feel they are usually treated as part of the family.
17425,You can tell the maid is not abused when she doesn't speak subserviently to her employer and speak casually like a friend and a equal.
17426,I could have conversation with my girlfriends in the house and the maid can join our chit chat.
17427,My mom and her maid chatter with each other non stop like buddies.
17428,"Just replace all the ""CECA"" with ""Ah Tiongs"" in all the arguments here and you'll get a good idea of how it's like in the early 2000s."
17429,Singapore also xenophobic.
17430,"The only reasons why it might seem global talents are used instead that I can think of are, (1) experience in scale, as in foreign countries usually have projects/companies that dealt with more $$ or ppl, (2) niche markets such as products that most Singaporean don't get the chance to deal with, so when Singapore wants talents in the field initially, it has to source foreign talents, (3) the product is proprietary, so only foreign specialists can access the core data."
17431,Did on occasion in a lift come across people like that who will comment in a derogative manners about migrant workers taking the lift after they leave the lift and looking towards you for agreement and consent.
17432,Singapore could justifiably arrest and prosecute you for flagrantly flouting their VTL requirements.
17433,"Singapore does choose its immigrants, and it's been known for a while that Singapore has taken in more Chinese immigrants than other racial groups."
17434,"In fact, a lot actively *prefer* coming to Singapore as temporary foreign workers to work legally, make money, and leave."
17435,Singapore does not have a black/african demographic and muslims tend to be malay and some indians and they experience plenty of racism.
17436,But affirmative action has been the answer to years and years of racism in countries like the States because the government has accepted on some fronts that the reason why black folks are so economically disprivileged is due to systemic discrimination for years.
17437,Singapore expat wives on Facebook.
17438,There’s also Singapore real expat wives in competition with the original that turns the cat fighting up to eleven.
17439,Singapore exploits not just migrant workers.
17440,"The infection rate among the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories, who have driven the surge in coronavirus patients, is now approaching 10 per cent."
17441,"Sectors including construction — which relies heavily on migrant workers — transportation, wholesale and retail trade all shrank in the first quarter of the year."
17442,Singapore gov and companies already profited billions of dollar by paying lowly foreign worker peanuts for decades now.
17443,Singapore government does not value the maid's life enough to give the murderer a life sentence.
17444,"At the per capita level, Singapore is drawing many more immigrants than any other developed country."
17445,"Thus, the issue of social tension is amplified and one way to manage this social tension is to control the type of immigrants with due consideration of their national origins."
17446,"If you want to use Singapore as justification for discussing immigration policy, you need to look at the overall policy rather cherry picks bits of it."
17447,Having people going round saying racist things?
17448,"Singapore has a history of racism, for sure - but it is not institutionalised and systemic racism since our independence."
17449,Singapore has a problem with racism and xenophobia that doesn't seem like anyone wants to address.
17450,Too many bigots couldn't comprehend how serious the xenophobic comment was.
17451,Some idiots outright denying the xenophobia  You can even be a true blue Singaporean and yet still face racism from your own countrymen.
17452,Not sure if I would consider that racism since it's not so much a hatred for Asians as it is a misconception that Caucasian = boss.
17453,We’ve seen no real progress in mi this but we’re constantly expanding a redundant VTL scheme?
17454,Singapore has something call income tax and on top of that all kind of levies on foreign workers.
17455,Singapore has strict rules on small issues such as smoking& chewing gum but when it comes to racism at the workplace they brush it under the carpet.
17456,Racism carries on from one job to another because you racist manager from one place bad mouths you in your next job.
17457,Singapore has systemic racism built into the country.
17458,Who is saying that there is no racism in Singapore?
17459,"Singapore herself is racist, she can't trust a specific race to be in sensitive units and there's no logistical issues in having said race in the unit."
17460,Singapore industries and business fear that loss in business opportunities and hiked prices might be looming if the migrant worker population decreases in the country.
17461,Singapore industries and business fear that loss in business opportunities and hiked prices might be looming if the migrant worker population decreases in the country.
17462,Singapore is Singapore because of immigrants.
17463,"If you're a local that can't compete with immigrants with no connections, no money with only their talents  in hand."
17464,And racism and xenophobia are considered unacceptable in all of them.
17465,The people who post TRE-style rhetoric in North America typically don't live in big cities; instead they often live in areas with very few immigrants or minorities.
17466,"Singapore is a great place for expats, horrible for locals who have to deal with the high cost of housing, car, etc"
17467,How does a foreign immigrant gain PR status in a small country limited in land and natural resources ?
17468,Singapore is a prison and the foreign workers are the ones in solitary confinement.
17469,Singapore is a tiny city-state where there are more immigrants looking to get in that to get out.
17470,"But hey, if saying ""foreign workers need to be treated like people"" is that offensive to you, here's something one of you fucking jackboots told me:  Go touch some fucking grass."
17471,"Preferably next to a foreign worker, if you can find one."
17472,"As for the migrant workers and domestic helpers, sadly they’re just being used to do jobs that locals don’t wanna do."
17473,"Singapore is crazy racist, just speak to any taxi driver."
17474,Maybe look for international school for chinese expats children?
17475,"We never reject expats, but they can’t be here taking away all our high value jobs which the locals can do."
17476,"If you call a mover in Australia, they send two fucking massive rugby players who balance fridges on one finger, and they'll get paid more than the 12 migrant workers combined."
17477,"We have maids quarters in our house, but there’s no AC and no hot water."
17478,I’m an expat though.
17479,You think it’s any better here for the maids?
17480,Singapore is racist.
17481,"Singapore is structurally, foundationally racist."
17482,"Our founding dictator was a world-famous racist, and he passed those ""values"" on, especially through the Ministry of ~~Education~~Regurgitation and Indoctrination and through NS."
17483,"Certain subsets of Singaporeans have been taught all their lives not to see the racism that is in front of their noses, since it is by definition well outside our ""OB markers""."
17484,That does *not* mean that the racism doesn't exist.
17485,You will likely remain in the expat bubble and that's fine.
17486,"Singapore lucked the hell out that our first major outbreaks were in foreign worker dormitories, and those relatively fit young men mostly survived Covid, though we might never know how many of them will be forced to live permanently diminished lives as a result."
17487,Singapore mask rules = Mass expat exodus = serious serious problem for the economy?
17488,Perhaps its a good time for SG to reset its presumed reliance on these 'expats'.
17489,Singapore most people can only speak english + mother tongue.
17490,Donald Trump is not going to come here and start spreading racist views.
17491,Singapore puts the races into 4 categories using the CMIO model.
17492,"You would be better off in places like Japan, UAE etc where good pay plus expat packages are the norm."
17493,Singapore still uses maids?
17494,"However, with regards to treatment of migrant workers its only the leader in  [Segunda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n) (Spanish Second Division)."
17495,Specially I saw the news Singaporean people assembled to the park and against the immigration policy of the government.
17496,Singapore to New York via Singapore Airlines VTL flight:  SG -> NY: Did my pre departure ART test at Healthway Hougang clinic.
17497,[i'm unsure for the other mother tongues]  But I don't think anyone can seriously argue that this current system achieves a higher language standard than a straight Chinese medium education.
17498,"excluding the elites) are generally mostly proficient in English and much less proficient (as compared to 'native' speakers) in their mother tongue, esp."
17499,Singapore wants immigrants?
17500,Tons of expats here who want to be immigrants but.
17501,"Foreigners expat have no loyalty to any nation, wherever pays better they goes there."
17502,"As a relatively young country made up almost entirely of immigrants, there is no single culture, and that, in a sense, is our ""culture""."
17503,Singapore's maid culture is quite simply ---   modern day slavery.
17504,"Singapore's racism is stereotype on the surface but won't do much harm, if someone calls on you for acting suspicious : SPF will check on you, or maybe ask for your identification."
17505,"America's racism is : If they find you acting suspicious or you looked like you were being out of place, they'll check on you and you'll be in sitting in interrogation room with handcuffs before you know it."
17506,"It's not exactly the racism that differs, it's the amount of trust in impartiality from law enforcers is what makes us different from other countries."
17507,"Singapore, in itself as a country, is not racist."
17508,"However, it is not right to claim that the citizens of Singapore are not racist."
17509,"Throughout our lives, at one point or another, we have been exposed to some form of racism."
17510,"Some of us are more exposed to these forms of racism, others not so much, and because of this, some of us grow to have certain prejudices."
17511,"I myself was once afraid of people from Bangladesh or India, not because I was racist but, because I was brought up to fear them."
17512,"Even the casual remark of calling a caucasian/eurasian an ""angmoh"" can be deemed as racist."
17513,"Although this argument is based off a more nationalistic topic, it does branch into racism as well."
17514,This anger can sometimes make an individual lose sight of the border between xenophobia and racism.
17515,"These are just 2 of many other factors that make it clear that racism can never die but it should be noted, that for all the ""racism"" that people claim, it is heartening to know that Singapore as a people is becoming more and more acceptive and tolerant of other races and religions."
17516,"Yes, as I've said, racism is something that will never die in Singapore."
17517,"Hence, some high-skilled expat with experience in biotechnology is going to get better treatment than literal manual labor."
17518,"Singapore, where racism and xenophobia is so prevalent you start to doubt whether you are in the wrong and not the other way around."
17519,We need more people like you who dont let racists get away with their hate.
17520,For example theres lots of posts about racism towards them on the front page of this subreddit.
17521,so how does it relate to racism?
17522,"i am NOT saying racism-driven physical harm cannot happen in singapore (there is one right now on front page), but  it is far, far less frequent than in western countries."
17523,Singaporean Chinese are super racist.
17524,Singaporean Chinese can be quite racist.
17525,But I'm not sure if this incident of yours counts as an actual instance of racism.
17526,"Perhaps this particular girl did indeed have racist intent when she shouted ""Apunehneh!"""
17527,"Honestly instances of clear-cut racism are quite rare (less frequent than I was expecting), and for the most part those instances are more of people acting stupid / drunk than anything else."
17528,These instances of more overt racism were quite harmless.
17529,"People being drunk and acting stupid aside , I feel that it's less of racism and more of 1. general impressions of Singapore and 2. depending on a person's opinions, an overall distrust of foreigners."
17530,"These comments don't feel like they come from place of prejudice/racism, they don't sound malicious, they are simply what other people have heard about Singapore."
17531,"Some people have very strong views about immigrants/foreigners, but their views change depending on the type of foreigner they are picturing/discussing."
17532,"Similarly, some people have expressed views about needing to be much more stern with which immigrants/foreigners are allowed entry into the UK, but when I mention that I am a foreigner, it becomes a 'Oh I didn't mean you, you speak English and are educated and you don't drain our resources...'."
17533,"In a way it is almost a We don't like foreigners in general, until you can prove that you're good enough to be here/stay sort of stance, which seems more of a general distrust of 'them' than racism directed at specific races."
17534,I can honestly say I've experienced far more overt and covert racism here in Singapore than I ever did in the UK.
17535,Of course that's not to say there isn't racism in the UK- but as a *minority* here and a *minority* there in the context of a university or as a professional you feel a lot less of it.
17536,"Racism certainly exists, but it generally has a low impact on living, and the vast majority of people you meet won't be racist to you."
17537,"If you can survive in the UK (I've lived there for many years, and racism is far worse), you will have no problem in SG."
17538,Definitely experienced way more racism at home than abroad.
17539,"TLDR: no racism abroad, only racism at home."
17540,"Singaporean Indians are not immigrants from India, they are settlers that are nativised to Southeast Asia, like the Chinese   Singaporean Indians have been in Singapore longer than the whitefella has been in Australia  I wish I had the confidence and hubris of a strappin Aussie bogan that strolls into another country’s sub uninvited to snark on a people and a nation he knows nothing about  Singaporeans Indians are the demographic that fought with the ANZACs during WWII."
17541,Singaporean are racist towards our own countrymen as well
17542,There is racism as well here in regards for looking for a place.
17543,The racism here in Singapore is very bad.
17544,Singaporean society is not xenophobic or racist; the two terms suggest a cultural trait.
17545,Why would anyone be a maid when you can earn more working at mcdonalds for example.
17546,Singaporeans are fucking racists.
17547,Seriously frustrating to read about such racist comments and especially so when it involves our fellow countryman.
17548,Singaporeans are helping these poor people   But why even have a maid?
17549,Westerners dont need maids.
17550,Japanese dont need maids  So why a first world Singapore still needs maids?
17551,"If Singaporeans can't even trust a highly qualified fellow Singaporean, they sure won't trust a migrant worker."
17552,Singaporeans are racist towards their own kind.
17553,The chinese are the leading racist in this country
17554,Singaporeans hate racism and are simultaneously racist themselves lmao
17555,"I wouldn't be surprised if the older generations were racists, but to see the younger generation in their 20s and below become racist and xenophobic because of what they learned from their family is just sad."
17556,"Singaporeans have been complaining about for the past decade about the number of expats, lets see now if its a good/bad thing they are lessening."
17557,"Singaporeans have been conditioned from young to not be racist, so racism is actually quite rare."
17558,"Singaporeans have been racist towards anyone non white or asian, since as long as I can remember."
17559,This is certified to not be racist.
17560,Low wage labour is hurting Singaporeans but the $400/month maid is indispensable.
17561,Singaporeans learn about racial harmony in schools but they did not learn how not to be racist.
17562,Singaporeans never disappoint in being xenophobic assholes.
17563,>The campaign began after an immigrant family from China complained about the smell of curry from a Singaporean Indian neighbour’s home and local officials brought about a compromise.
17564,Singaporeans working abroad are also expats.
17565,"Singaporeans: ""We need to improve the living conditions of these foreign workers."""
17566,"Also Singaporeans: ""We don't need no stinking smelly-ass Indian subcontinent foreign workers living near our residences."""
17567,"To my smooth brain, I tried to wrinkle it by seeing the perspectives of the foreign worker eking out a living in a foreign land, a local citizen being bombarded with information overload about his prospective ""rivals"" at the workplace, the kids growing up with said local citizen having ingrained specific stereotypes on people based on their skin colour, the business owner trying to balance between a cheap labour from overseas versus an untested local labour force, and the government trying to strike a balance in everything."
17568,Singaporeans: we are not proud of the way migrant workers are treated!!
17569,The “brownface” ad has obvious racist undertones because it exaggerates the physical characteristics of an Indian.
17570,Sinkie default attitude: always think the worst of the FDWs we're virtually totally dependent on.
17571,The only racism you'll encounter is reverse-prejudice.
17572,Slapping racists should be normalised by society.
17573,"Coming from a privileged perspective, you may not realise that there are lots of people out in the world who actually want to work as a maid."
17574,"If everyone thought like you and refused to hire a maid, those who would suffer the most would be the same young women of the developing world who you are trying to protect."
17575,These maids chose to come because they represent a better financial situation than their home country.
17576,"But that would also mean some people cannot afford it, so less maids are able to get out of their situations at home."
17577,They work here as FDWs to save up for higher education back home.
17578,"Working conditions as FDWs here are not subjectively bad, compared to what they'd do at home."
17579,"As blue-collar workers, their jobs are limited to beer bars, prostitution, agriculture where they're exposed to microbial parasites, neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals, $2/day backbreaking sweatshop factory work for Nike or some other shitty western clothing manufacturer where they'd risk not being paid by unscrupulous agents, being a maid back home (or worse, in Saudi Arabia or one of those shithole Arab gulf states where there's **real** slavery going on), and others  Some maids here have it pretty good that they don't even want to leave (I have a childhood friend whose maid has worked for them longer than I've been alive)."
17580,"Most will also eat the same food (but some twats will feed their maid maggi mee and white bread, but that's also against the law judging by a recent case)."
17581,I'd agree that domestic helper's wages are low compared to what they can earn in HK or Taiwan and there is a conversation to be held about that.
17582,A maid is an employee.
17583,Slightly off topic - You shouldn't compare H1B (speciality skill visa with min requirement of bachelors degree) and 250k maids in SG (no qualification?).
17584,( I'm not basing it on this singular comment but your comment history which should be a case-study how normalizing racist narratives work)
17585,You expect land VTL to open with a bang meh?
17586,"Smart agency may bring an maid for an employer A with price of x per month and ask him to pay shn costs and than move maid to employer b with x +y per month and no shn costs.. employer A is screwed, maid gets more money, agency gets double commission.. technically employer A can send maid back but its also an hassle, agencies tell employers they will try to find a free replacement maid if they don't send prev one back"
17587,"> Referring to an Instagram story re-posted by Ms Sarah on Jun 11, the PA said Ms Sarah had shared claims by another user that the incident perpetuates ""racist culture""."
17588,"> The PA also said that Ms Sarah characterised the standee incident as “racist” by lumping it with ""other racist attacks and incidents"" in one of her posts, and that she ""insinuated"" in an interview with Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah that the PA's staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”."
17589,"For fucks sake, why not we pay all our migrant workers in exposure..."
17590,So ... xenophobia is all right....
17591,The FDW?
17592,"So I am trying to find the original statement from Dr Tambyah which I could only find here ([https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-focus-on-public-health-could-have-been-lost-paul-tambyah-12899558](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-focus-on-public-health-could-have-been-lost-paul-tambyah-12899558)   ""And then what happened was the employers started thinking, 'hey my  workers are living in the same dormitory maybe you should bring them for  testing'."
17593,"MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they  brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they would lose  their work pass privileges."
17594,"But of course if you go around Singapore its rare that you find Singaporeans speaking like the characters on T.V, there are indeed some that speak completely in their mother tongue most of the time and those that have been much more western influence that their speech tends to sound more ""ang mo"" (like me)."
17595,"Should i approach him...  Not to be racist, but a lot of Asians look like Jian Yang you know."
17596,I am an Indian American (Tamil but brought up fully in America) and I've read a lot about how we are made fun of and are the subject of racism in SG.
17597,I really don't know how far the racism goes so my apologies if I'm overexaggerating!
17598,I mean since almost every white male here will come as an expat or foreign talent then it’s certain that they are top in their respective countries.
17599,But same will apply to Chinese or Indian expats as well.
17600,"So I made this comment elsewhere, but I thought it might be worth writing a separate post about it given that many people on this sub seem to have the impression that Sarah Bagharib recklessly threw around allegations of racism."
17601,"As most people on this sub probably know by now, the PA has claimed that Sarah ""*raise[d] the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments*""."

17609,"If that's the case, they appear to be referencing [this story](https://imgur.com/a/UkBfrNL), where Sarah says she's grateful to allies who stood alongside minorities ""*in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents which have been filmed)*""."
17610,"This is, at best, an indirect (and possibly unintentional) allusion to the incident being ""*racist*"", and imo certainly doesn't on its own warrant the response she got from the PA."
17611,"Think about it - if you wanted to thank people for their support over both this incident and the other incidents we've seen over the past few weeks (with the latter clearly being racist), how would you phrase it?"
17612,"Even if you didn't think this particular incident was racist, could you have ended up with Sarah's phrasing, because your focus was more on thanking people than it was on being very clear about which incidents were racist and which were ""*culturally insensitive*""?"
17613,"While a plain reading appears to lump this in with other racist incidents, it could just as easily have been imprecise phrasing, especially given that Sarah's main posts contained no mention of racism."
17614,">3) Insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism""  On its face, this is very obviously not an accusation of racism, and doesn't strike me as a particularly serious allegation."
17615,"In any case, the quote in question is from her hour-long interview with Walid J. Abdullah (not linking it here because I'm not sure it's allowed under the sub's rules), and appears to be the bit from around 9 minutes - 8.30 minutes before the end of the interview:  ""*There was a comment there as well about internalised racism, which, it is what it is, it's so conditioned, to, you know, think that this is a certain way, you know, there's nothing wrong with this because people are colour blind, I guess, or like, blind to racism at play*""  She's not directly referencing the PA, its staff, or this particular incident here, although this follows a segment where she spoke about the possibility of meeting Melvin Yong."
17616,"In any case, it's quite clear to me that she's not accusing anyone of racism, but of **failing to notice racism**."
17617,"In particular, it's worth noting that the context here is ""*internalised racism*"", presumably among minorities who get used to inappropriate behaviour and come to accept it as normal - in other words, it's quite possible that she's talking about **minorities who are blind to racism against themselves**."
17618,"Her words aren't entirely clear here (likely because she's responding to an IG Live comment on the spot), but even taking the least charitable interpretation possible, she's not accusing the PA of racism."
17619,"Personally, assuming everything above is accurate, it's hard for me to resist the conclusion that the PA went out of their way to look for every possible manner in which Sarah could have conceivably accused them of ""*racism*"", and premised their statement on that."
17620,"It certainly doesn't seem to me that she recklessly threw allegations of racism around, like I've seen many people on this subreddit suggest."
17621,whether the PA has characterised Sarah's characterisation correctly (and not whether Sarah's purported characterisation of the incident as racist was fair).
17622,A big part of the anti-CECA claims are about unfettered transfer of people circumventing said visa processes.
17623,"](https://www.gov.sg/factually/content/can-indian-professionals-work-in-singapore-without-valid-work-passes) Also CECA agreements are not exempt from Fair Consideration Framework, unlike what Lim Tean claimed in the rally."
17624,"The plight of foreign workers is real, as is the deficiency in the infrastructure created to care for them."
17625,I'm working as a user experience designer in Dubai and I have two years of experience so far so I my question is about how to land a job in Singapore as an expat and what salary should I expect for my level.
17626,This has to be the standard protocol for transporting workers.
17627,So PAP condones racism?
17628,So Singapore is racist af
17629,So a racist preference lah
17630,So a screenshot of 9 indians on linkedin is proof that people with fake creds are running rampant in sg but a screenshot of 13 racists is not proof?
17631,Then watch minorities cry racism when Chinese buyers are snapping up units that was supposed to be reserved for them.
17632,Got EIP = racist outcome.
17633,No EIP = also racist outcome.
17634,In fact if they think they have won this debate and continue to pursue their open immigration policy then I fear for them.
17635,Not against free flow of goods and trade but against free flow of people which CECA is just a lightning rod for.
17636,"Took it long enough, honestly suffered enough as a mixed race person in SG...too tired & hurt to bother anymore after endless racist comments since i was a kid especially targeted at my father who is of minority race."
17637,Such comments coming from chinese people themselves... Not sure how many times i went home all upset because some person decided to spout their nonsensical racist remarks about my parents and myself.
17638,So all the current non-dorm cases are linked to the the dormitory spread?
17639,"If that is the cases, I wonder why they do not report it as part of dormitory cluster since they are linked and instead show it as separate from both local and dorm cases."
17640,So are you a maid?
17641,So basically traveling via non-VTL is less of a hassle then?
17642,"So basically what you're saying is that.. Yeah, Singaporeans are racist, and that's just the way it is.. Hmm.."
17643,"So because a post has not much upvotes, you're saying the people here are racists?..."
17644,"So because she’s Malaysian and privileged, we don’t have a racism problem here in Singapore?"
17645,"So by your definition, racists are not crazy, they are just extreme in their opinions/views, then why so butthurt?"
17646,"This particular racist in video is being wrong here because he is being openly discrimatory, if it's a closet racist, I doubt there will be so much voice for ""social justice""."
17647,So can FDWs pm you their nudes?
17648,So can I take it that the angst is against all FTAs and not only about CECA.
17649,So can we do something about racist aunties?
17650,"If being racially insulated requires I will become an evil racist, how would someone from China or Taiwan be immune?"
17651,Also making blaming an entire culture for the actions of their political leaders is like saying local racism is PAPs fault.
17652,So did the author suggest the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) introduced in 1989 is actually racist.
17653,So do you ask the maids if they are sitting apart out of choice or forced to and whether they got eat properly or not?
17654,So does foreign worker levy.
17655,"1.1% of the population caught it, with over 80% (54,000) of those cases being dormitory ones."
17656,"So excessive paperwork, dedicated VTL buses."
17657,"If she go back Malaysia, racism here will disappear ah?"
17658,"So gathering from what you said can I say that if I were to ask where I can turn to for help if I am being stalk or disturbed online in a game or no the answer will be that there is no way to do anything about this, which luckily for this specific example I quoted there is a law for that extending even overseas, and how luckily racist issue is a law now when it didn't use to be one that causes people to fight among one another and ministry manpower didn't use to be a thing either so people were being liberally let go because of biaseness ostracization etc now even going to the extent of controlling foreigner limit."
17659,I am comparing it to racist simply because it follows the same concept as that in that it is a situation of treating people with favoritism in a bad way.
17660,If I want to compare to another example that is nothing to do with racism also can if it has anything to do with ostracizing.
17661,"So genuine question then, were the expats under 40 somehow at less risk than citizens?"
17662,So give the foreign worker who raped a person at kranji 2 weeks only also because he's a foreigner and no point keeping him here?
17663,I'm glad more people are willing to speak out about racism and microaggressions in Singapore.
17664,So higher level expats are a-ok to milk and eek out?
17665,So general population racist viewpoints become his racist viewpoints because what he say is based off the population views?
17666,So how do you propose we treat racists?
17667,So how is elitism any better than racism?
17668,"So if I did brownface and I said but it wasn't malicious, would that not make me a racist?"
17669,"So if I make a comment abt Chinese and Japanese loving to eat rice, is it racist as well?"
17670,"So if I open up a restaurant, with a sign that says that 'No Malays and Indians allowed', with the justification being 'oh its my business decision to only serve Chinese customers', is that racist?"
17671,The very definition of racism is the discrimination of of an individual on the basis of the person belonging to a particular race.
17672,The issue starts if we start to normalize institutionalized racism as pure business acumen.
17673,"So if even if you're vaccinated, Singapore requires you travel on a specific VTL flight and then pay upwards of $300 on testing?"
17674,There are maids who can stay for 20+ years and don’t want to go back themselves because their family is here.
17675,"And when they fall ill with a major disease (one was reported in the news, got cancer) the family decided to help treat her, even hire another maid to look after her and the family."
17676,"Sure, there are bad, power-hungry apples who mistreat their FDWs, but we can’t ignore the good families who treat their maids as equal human beings."
17677,So if you don't know the difference between Yukata and Kimono does that make you racist?
17678,"So in other words, you're saying we should not be racist or xenophobic but it's okay to be homophobic and transphobic."
17679,Now bringing into our context is it your contention that we should not have foreign workers?
17680,"So instead of placing the burden of racism on racists, we can now blame these 3 spooky reasons without any empirical evidence whatsoever?"
17681,"So instead of questioning the way that SG is dealing with borders and closures, we are supposed to shamelessly focus on how VTL is great and praise the guys who arrange it?"
17682,So is it racist if it is true?
17683,So is preference racist or not racist?
17684,"If such standards get enforced for even migrant workers, SAF will also have to sit up and start taking more notice of these standards."
17685,So it’s just racism with a “tinge” of sexism then
17686,"So just to be clear, what you’re saying is that in certain  situations, a FDW will consent to a sexual relationship with an employee out of fear of being fired/not giving an allowance?"
17687,"So long you meet all the prevailing\* VTL requirements, yea, then no need to serve."
17688,So many expats really out here wilding on this thread.
17689,So many experts on racism here.
17690,So some people assume it’s alright to be racist and unjust if provoked.
17691,So many idiots here were quick to pin this incident to racism.
17692,"My family and I recently started doing things like giving iced water to foreign workers because my block was being painted, and leaving out food and water for delivery personnel."
17693,So many people preaching for mental health yet many brushing off racists incidents.
17694,Of course racist are everywhere but you expect us to just accept those jokes?
17695,"Transparency is a double edged sword, if it stokes racism then it isn't wise to reveal everything either."
17696,You’re the first racist asshole I’ve met in 3 years living here.
17697,The reality is that what we know as community spread doesn't include the dorm-based foreign worker population as the government's measures effectively isolates them from what we see as the community around us.
17698,"If they addressed the foreign worker situation in its own op-ed, yeah by all means."
17699,The title reads more like coverage of the migrant worker situation than a true report on whether Singapore actually lost control of the virus outbreak.
17700,So must show deep understanding of Malay culture then is considered not racist is it?
17701,"So new VTLs are currently closed, contradicting the sentiment in the headline."
17702,So nice to get a maid to pass the child when upbringing becomes difficult.
17703,"Child cries (day or night), need diaper change, need bath, or need feeding, give to maid."
17704,"So no VTL anymore, damn"
17705,"How does "" That’s why many of my Chinese friends are like: “Wah, overseas people are so racist!"
17706,Good thing Singapore no racism”.
17707,"They don’t realize that racism/xenophobia usually affects the minority (or less powerful) class of person (which is why “no racism” in Singapore). """
17708,"\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot."
17709,So one of your expat friends was told that so it must be widely accepted?
17710,Despite several other posts telling you that companies pay based on perceived skill and not expatness.
17711,So only boomers are racist?
17712,"Which was why i use the reverse card as an examples to get you,the majority to understand better why OP felt that the staff were being racist towards her."
17713,After being told to keep her dog on leash the owner said that my dog is very well behaved and that doesn’t happen (her maid walks her dog).
17714,So she was both his maid and girlfriend?
17715,So should sg becomes a mother tongue nation next and do away with being forced to speak english due to multicultural thing?
17716,So sick and tired of the racism I face here as a minority.
17717,"They’ll just be replaced by locals at the junior level, and the junior level locals will gain enough experience to be promoted, thus reducing reliance on foreign workers at all levels."
17718,"So since ""every one"" is doing it, racism is fine, right?"
17719,"Also, depending on which nationality that maid is, I've heard some who've hired PIs to track them down to rain wrath upon their actions."
17720,So sorry to read about what happened with you - fuck these twats - racist mofos
17721,So telling “Singaporeans to wake up to “detrimental racism”” is creating awareness and helping to solve the real problem.
17722,So that makes the guy hurling xenophobic remarks any right?
17723,"So the 24 migrant workers who have their work passes revoked have their careers ruined and are owing big debts, but the RQ FTs here are worried about the small trouble of having to uproot if they have their passes revoked?"
17724,** Don’t be racist or hateful or troll.
17725,So the expat did not wear mask.
17726,"So the prosecution is saying with over 90 stabs and most of those were to the neck and body, the maid was not killing with intention to cause death but murder by causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death, so over 90 stabs the maid want to cause harm that will most likely cause death of the employer?"
17727,So the son admits to cross dresses to frame the maid?
17728,They're not selling in high quantities and I do see some business from the domestic workers and their boyfriends...
17729,Can't help but be on OP's side here when it comes to his/her questions about racism and what not.
17730,And the news clearly stated none of the maid who contracted covid 19 got it from foreign workers.
17731,And that sums up the entirety of Singapore's mother tongues?
17732,"So this cunt has been saying Singapore isnt ready to get rid of 377A, now he acts all surprised there is racism?"
17733,"His very first tenant was an indian family, probably expat with the rest of the family on Dependent pass (just a guess)  When the lease expire, the family left Singapore."
17734,"So my question is sure, its rather racist and discriminatory for landlords to refuse letting their newly bought apartments to Indians."
17735,"I dont condone racism, and neither does my friend, but im sure many landlords will rather play it safe than ending up spending significant amount on hiring cleaners to deep the apartment"
17736,I hired a domestic helper recently.
17737,The irony of this situation is I have to mop my own floor and iron my own clothes while this domestic worker just laze around my mom's house at my expense.
17738,"So to summarize the long post, they should be lucky that they're facing racism in Singapore instead of western countries?"
17739,* Food security - tbh this is an area that probably only gained significant attention when covid happened and we got concerned about border closures and how we were going to get food from malaysia and other countries (tb to panic buying days).
17740,Now they want to focus on the foreign worker so Singaporeans later.
17741,So u are racist?
17742,So ultimately you are saying domestic workers do not need to be treated any better as they are now isn't it?
17743,So wakeupsingapore posted this on Facebook and even that post had a few dumb/racist comments lmao
17744,So we agree that a preference isn't racist?
17745,Then are we also punishing the maid because she has no money?
17746,So we just accept racism?
17747,"So we learned     Acute Pain meaning - money more important than migrant workers life, migrant workers family."
17748,Acute Pain meaning - putting migrant workers on unsafe transport then saying shameless that the city is safe for all.
17749,So we we cut the expat salaries by half that will greatly reduce inflation by your logic?
17750,as the latter group will have to do a SHN as long as they can't get a seat on a VTL flight?
17751,So weird you demand literally every single Singaporean to be surveyed in order to determine if we are racist (never heard of random sampling ah???
17752,Sure you read the shitty maid abusive cases now and then but who the fuck can really police everyone.
17753,"Being a maid in KSA for example, but this is then just whataboutism."
17754,So what is the rejection rate of EP and PR  applications  made by individuals who are here under CECA?
17755,So what saved us from this outbreak becoming uncontrolled community spread is our natural disdain for the migrant workers and never interacting with them as a separate caste.
17756,"The employer the carry on as usual and accept that the maid may fuck up, risking pregnancy or that the maid could bring some a random stranger you don’t know to your house when you’re not home?"
17757,Or perhaps you were expecting the employer to bear the burden and lose a $5000 bond if caught with a pregnant maid?
17758,So what you are saying is that it's ok to make fun of a language that a certain race uses and not be racist?
17759,"So when you have no response to a valid argument, you disregard it by putting down ""appealing to..religious scripture"" but instead forward your indoctrinated racism by appealing to boogiemen (the guy you don't even know exists)?"
17760,You complain about government allowing delta in yet also complain about restrictions on migrant workers who are mostly from South Asia where delta originated from.
17761,So who are the ones benefiting from the current immigration policy and in what ways?
17762,"So with all these new VTLs established, what are they going to increase the VTL quota to now?"
17763,"Can't we just do away with flight differentiated measures to implement SHN and simply rely on negative PCR tests, vax status and travel history for countries on the VTL approved list?"
17764,Not to mention they are also looking to establish land travel (trains and buses) VTLs with Malaysia too.
17765,So with the latest outbreaks in some foreign worker dorms.
17766,So you actually support racism?
17767,"So you agree that when Chinese people say  “Wah, overseas people are so racist!"
17768,"Good thing Singapore no racism”, this is an incomplete view based on their anecdotal experiences?"
17769,"Not being xenophobic here, but leave if you can..."
17770,So you are saying VTL will incentivise them to come over because it is so much easier to go to and fro?
17771,So you are saying we should ban international schools because they also breed racists?
17772,Surrounded by one race means racist right?
17773,So you mean a Malay who only dates other Malays is racist?
17774,"Moreover I agree that my parents might not qualify for citizenship, as they are at the end of the day immigrants to Singapore and might return back anytime."
17775,"So you never worked in our Ministry of Manpower before, who is the agency handling employment pass requests."
17776,"Before going , best to get all the VTL information together."
17777,So you think it is okay to do wht he did even if he or the expats wre asymptomatic carrier?
17778,So you think it's ok to make racist jokes/derogatory remarks?
17779,You're really a fool if you think you're not a racist if you don't want to rent it to an Indian man because you simply assume things about others.
17780,"That's not because you're a racist, that's correct."
17781,It's because you're a xenophobic person who likes assuming things about people you don't know.
17782,"So you think stoking xenophobia and racism, just to arm twist the govt to release the data, is a win?"
17783,Nice to see the casual racism on here!
17784,"A more logical solution than yours to solve this apparent foreign worker problem would be to grant all work pass holders citizenship, you would then have 1.9pc unemployment and 0pc foreign workers."
17785,So you were able to apply successfully for VTP/VTL directly?
17786,So you would rather them delay the air VTL just so that they can announce both of them at the same time?
17787,That's really the issue you want to point out instead of why everyone is being racist to each other?
17788,You're going to ask me for evidence/proof of my suffering based on the racism I've experienced (clearly because you never experienced anything to a degree where it actually affects you).
17789,"You said:  >if you experience any racist episode means fuck you mate, you don’t get it any worse than us minorities."
17790,I said:  >  I could be racist to you and it's definitely fucking wrong  &#x200B;  >  Why were you having trouble applying for jobs due to your race ?
17791,&#x200B;  > You said your teacher is racist as fuck and said racist shit to you.
17792,"It's fucking embarassing that you're trying to ""call me out"" here by asking me these things when it just reinforces the idea of how unaware, ignorant and racist you really are."
17793,Trying to turn the racism around on me.
17794,&#x200B;  > You said your teacher is racist as fuck and said racist shit to you.
17795,&#x200B;  > You mentioned that after suffering a racist attack I can walk outside and carry on my life with the majority Chinese ?
17796,So with the majority being Chinese I will magically be immune to said racist attack?
17797,"I'm sure we're not lacking in chinese males.. :o  &#x200B;  >Just because you are majority race, if you experience any racist episode means fuck you mate, you don’t get it any worse than us minorities."
17798,"I already stated racism as a whole is wrong, but minorities are the ones whose LIVES are affected by racism simply because the majority is chinese."
17799,"Majority of people everywhere you go are chinese, indians and malays can be racist to you but you'll still be able to enjoy your life normally because you will be in the presence of YOUR OWN RACE."
17800,Whereas minorities who suffer racism will go out into the world into the eyes of the majority race and CONTINUE to suffer.
17801,And as for you trying to turn this around on me saying I'm low-key racist.
17802,"I'm only stating the truth, if your ego is THAT fragile and you're this upset then it's clear as fucking day that your racism is showing and you need to do some deep searching to figure out how to be less of a ignoring fucking loser lol."
17803,"Considering, foreigners are either on expat or local+benefits packages."
17804,If you still think that is unfair then I'm afraid you're just another entitled immigrant.
17805,So you're saying it's the owner's right to be racist?
17806,So you're saying one can only turn racist if you are surrounded by Chinese in Singapore but not in China or Taiwan?
17807,"So you're saying the intent wasn't racist (no real proof for that, by the way) so we should overlook the racist outcome?"
17808,"Because as we have discussed at length, CRT is the study of legislative, cultural and Social mechanisms inherited from the British that perpetuate racism"
17809,So you’re citing anecdotal experiences for your dislike towards CECA?
17810,"So, I am an American expat who grew up here (went to SAS from 13-19)."
17811,"Also, I faced quite a bunch of racism over there."
17812,"So, I understand that many people are frustrated with the apparent racism faced when trying to rent and sometimes, purchase a property."
17813,Everybody is quick to point out racist questions and remarks made by property agents that they have been in contact with.
17814,"Personally, I've withdrawn my services from many clients, for reasons including but not limited to racism, being assholes, etc."
17815,"So, I was at a play called ""Disgraced"" last night, which dealt with themes of racial and immigrant identity."
17816,"For domestic workers, its sad to say that they are not on the list."
17817,"So, if I have to make a stinging quip, this is an example of ""Singaporeans becoming more liberal (economically speaking) but still socially conservative (treating foreign domestic workers as ""slaves"")?"""
17818,"So, racism is allowed but a metal band isn't."
17819,"So, tell me how that term isn't racist, here in this discussion about racism?"
17820,"So, thinly veiled racism?"
17821,"So, this is a case of complex racism."
17822,"So... expat = ang moh, immigrant = FT, foreigner = FW?"
17823,So...  We shouldn't be too hard on racists?
17824,Of course most of them had arrived through VTL.
17825,Most of the people is traveling through VTL.
17826,"Class is a massive segregator, but I don't deny that racism exists."
17827,"Some O level hacks:  -For mother tongue, memorize three generic essays then no matter what the prompts are go in and regurgitate one of the essays making it fit the prompt as best as you can."
17828,"Some Singaporeans be complaining about their shitty bosses at work, then go home and be shitty to their maid"
17829,"Some Singaporeans do discriminate against people of so-called ""lesser races"" (you guys know alr I don't need to name them here), but it isn't xenophobia to have legitimate concerns about quantity of immigrants that are entering this country, as well as the type of immigrants we are seeking to invite in."
17830,"The Singaporean government arguably erred in the last 10 years by accepting way too many immigrants within a short period, leading to mass popular discontent and creating a massive backlash."
17831,Some VTL countries have higher daily cases (absolute and per capita) and lower vax rate than Malaysia.
17832,Unless the criteria to open VTL with Malaysia isn't the same as to these other countries.
17833,"If I had to pay 2-3k with no guarantee that the helper would be able to do/want to do the job/want to transfer to an expat employer, then I'll probably look for another nationality, hire a transfer fdw or go for part timers."
17834,Some agency should start vetting their maids better and use that to differentiate themselves.
17835,Some cheapo pennypinchers also get their domestic helpers to work in their office or mom and pop shops
17836,"Is freedom important for some expats, yes."
17837,"Does Singapore need expats, yes for certain roles and certain skillset."
17838,Simply stating that expats are bad is stupid.

17841,"Some domestic helpers also feel that ""helper"" is a degrading term leh."

17844,Some families even bring their domestic workers for holidays ...which imo is great!
17845,"I think showing solidarity and whatever is fine, but fundamentally I agree with this: > What I cannot stand however, is influencers/anyone saying to SINGAPOREANS that if you don't support the BLM you're complicit in the oppression of blacks, or to equate in some sense american racism and singapore racism (not in the sense of whataboutery but more like importing the same severity)."
17846,Some guy say if you have a preference means you are racist.
17847,Some maids asked to work on off days without compensation ~~amid phase 2 measures~~
17848,Some maids quite good like it ilo ilo

17852,"The maid is foregoing the ""monies owed"" voluntarily"
17853,"Some money lenders even have the audacity to put signs outside of their store saying ""maids welcomed"""

17859,We've argued over her racist remarks countless times.
17860,Some of our elites are also xenophobic.
17861,Some of the earlier commenters complaining about racism don't even know both parties are Indians until somebody pointed it out to them...
17862,Of course expats shouldn’t get to dictate such policy.
17863,You think expats won’t come flocking back at that time?
17864,Give an expat a choice between living in either of these countries vs living in most of the neighbouring countries and a very large majority will choose singapore or HK.
17865,Make an effort to understand their culture and values   \- Educate ourselves on their experience on racism.
17866,"It could be racism, personal development, in relationships..."
17867,"But more importantly I was also disappointed with PAP's neglect of our estate, POFMA, attacks on Raeesha and the CECA deal."
17868,You mean this subreddit was being xenophobic there?
17869,But not necessarily true when it comes to the snitching culture (and how toxic this has become) or how we treat migrant workers.
17870,What you are saying is racist to the nth degree and denigrated workers in two sectors that have helped make Singapore what it is today.you should be ashamed.
17871,Some people think its not racist to say all malays like this all indians like that.
17872,"If you don't think its racist to say all malays wear the same to costume for their weddings, birthdays, hari raya, funerals, then its not racist lo how to argue."
17873,Some people treat their maids like low class scum.
17874,Just check out the fancy restaurants in town on weekends and you'll see... eg; maids standing and waiting on the kid while everyone's seated having a meal...

17876,What is the rejection rate for Intracompany transfers under CECA?
17877,"Sadly, the fine won't go into the maids' pockets."
17878,Some will spew bs that “racism doesn’t exist in Singapore” and illustrate the US as an example of what “racism really is”.
17879,"They’ll justify that their unequal treatment of races on such a level is not really racism, don’t know how they reconcile that but that’s how they live."
17880,Somebody more familiar with workman’s comp can answer that but I think for sure there are differences for migrant worker compensation and of course the value of the compensation itself compared to say a local.
17881,"Somebody should make a ""Singapore racism apologist"" starter pack lol"
17882,"Heck, the first incarnation of the Singapore Slingers was almost **exclusively** foreign talent."
17883,"Someone I know shared a post about migrant workers some time ago that was really uncharitable, but I don't follow and haven't seen any other content."
17884,Someone being racist doesn’t mean others can too.
17885,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the whole point of an expat package that the employee is given higher pay in exchange for stability?"
17886,Does this warrant that the majority race in Singapore is racist?
17887,"It certainly doesnt warrant the topic of racism, we can be taught that there is a difference in costume but to lump it with all the other pent up issues about this and that."
17888,"Someone didn't read the article, because maids are allowed to leave the house, just not to meet friends."
17889,"Personally, I read the CECA agreement itself."
17890,"You can check the relevant section ""Movement of Natural Persons"" here [https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA\_India/Legal\_Text/Chapter9\_Movement\_of\_Natural\_Persons](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/Chapter9_Movement_of_Natural_Persons)  The long term stay is allowed for Intra-Corporate Transferees only."

17892,"Someone on this sub once called me a racist... because I used the word ""angmoh"" to describe someone else."
17893,"According to that guy, it is a racist slur."
17894,Someone should make these people live 1 day in the shoes of the migrant workers just to provide some perspective
17895,Someone should study the psychosocial impact of having maids on Singapore society-- how it has influenced our societal values and norms.
17896,Someone shouting out “there’s racism somewhere in this universe” isn’t going to do anything or help with anything.
17897,"How about instead of preaching about “detrimental racism” that exists somewhere in this universe, we strive to celebrate and promote racial harmony and individualism, this is much more important for the progression of society."
17898,"Someone who is neither Malay nor Muslim being offended on the behalf of Malays, Muslims, and accusing random strangers online of racism and sealioning, despite thinking that ketupats and the colour green are not synonyomous with Hari Raya."
17899,Guess moral outrage and claiming racism is really the flavour of the month.
17900,"--- > “Our testing capacity for migrant workers is about 3,000 a day."
17901,"Instead, we have been increasing the capacity of testing of our migrant workers."""
17902,I'm so happy to see SG treat its ill migrant workers in such a humane way.
17903,Something something no more VTL cause its how omicron comes in /sssssssssss
17904,Something tells me the maid's finally somewat happy she has managed to get out of that household.
17905,I don't know if people treat maids like that for the same reason.
17906,Sometimes even friends' recommendations can turn out racist.
17907,"The average expat is, however, more skilled than the average Singaporean."
17908,"Because the ""average Singaporean"" involves taking into consideration Mdm CEO as well as Mr School-dropout, but the ""average expat"" is literally a self-selected group of professionals."
17909,"I apologise for sounding xenophobic , but I had to put  this small rant out after reading such an irritating reply."
17910,"Sometimes, being a racist is not entirely our own choice."
17911,"Somewhat related question:  People with maids, do you allow them to eat at the dinner table together with the family?"
17912,Sooo...is she concerned about the general level of racism in Singapore?
17913,"But (and I'm not saying it's okay ) if a Singaporean Chinese goes through some racism from the other races, it wont' affect his/her life here at all honestly with the population being vastly chinese."
17914,That's why the racism hurts.
17915,Sorry about my ignorance but what's is a FDW?
17916,"Sorry about your individual experiences of racial prejudice (which are also experienced by minorities but i digress), but my point still holds that from an institutional viewpoint, by virtue of colour, you do not face the same kind of systemic racism that local minorities do and you still stand at the top of the racial hierarchy."
17917,I don’t doubt that Singapore society is racist.
17918,"Similar to Denmark (which is still on VTL), I wouldn't be surprised if they perhaps imposed a 4day isolation or something"
17919,"Sorry again, I felt like that was sensitive to say but at the same time I felt like it was impossible for something so specific to be ""funny"" when every other racist kid has had the same reaction."
17920,I give you props for trying to downplay his issues with racism by bringing in a religious angle.
17921,It's precisely the kind of attitude that people like you possess which further entrenches racism.
17922,Pritam is just another politician trying to increase his vote base by fanning xenophobia.
17923,"Some industries are, have been and likely will remain very generous with expat packages."
17924,Sorry don't you know the majority can never be a victim of racism?!
17925,"Sorry for being an idiot, but are you simply implying that the employment market isn't as good for expats right now as it used to be, or is there an underlying message?"
17926,Im sure theres also of course non racist japanese ppl that treat singaporeans like the chinese with respect and vice versa.
17927,"https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ljdlgk/more_singaporean_women_finding_a_foreign_mr_right/gnce9e3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share    this is a topic on xenophobia, so yeah in my humble opinion its related."
17928,"I was just wondering about the ambiguity of classifying work permit holders not living in dorms, as they seem to refer to the latter category, rather than the former."
17929,You won't be treated like shit in hotels/hawker centres but I've noticed a lot of subtle racism.
17930,Sorry genuinely curious here - why is it racist to use their wedding photo for Hari raya?
17931,"I've seen too many people I know fall into this anti-sjw nonsense that ends up being a pipeline for all kinds of weird alt-right, racist, and sexist behaviour, which makes sense since the actual term was claimed and appropriated by those sort of people in the first place."
17932,"In my country, Germany, blacks and Muslims experiences daily racism."
17933,My black and Muslim accointances in SG do not experience racism.
17934,If we want to extrapolate we could say that: - SG people are not racist towards the same people as Germans are
17935,I don't support the racist xenophobic comments.
17936,I'm just mentioning the ingrained racism brought upon by our parents generation and how it affects us and my experiences with this.
17937,I have the following additions to make as a Singapore born American expat living in Singapore.
17938,"Dog friendly expat locales would be near the beaches (east coast and west coast area), bukit timah, Holland V, Botanic Gardens area."
17939,If you're willing to look at non expat locales there's good dog friendly parks at Bishan and Pasir Ris as well.
17940,"It's not just in-house domestic workers, there are also a bunch of cleaning agencies where you can get a cleaner weekly, biweekly, fortnightly, etc.."
17941,Education for expat kids is insanely expensive but if OP's kid is young enough he doesn't have to worry about that yet.
17942,Clinics and hospitals don't turn you down just because you are an expat.
17943,Impartial legal recourse is also available to you as an expat.
17944,"Sorry that you got this kinda xenophobic treatment, bro."
17945,"I would say that none of the people who said that racist shit to your face have ever lived overseas, and few of the people who are trying to explain away the racism that you've experienced here have lived overseas before as well."
17946,Sorry that you had to deal with such a racist fuckwit.
17947,Because I know a lot of expats who attend those schools to learn English as a second language.
17948,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but if the process of land VTL is the same as Air VTL, then there are multiple COVID-19 tests to be taken both directions."
17949,"Sorry to hear about that :( Unfortunately the immigration policy here basically strongly prefers specific ethnicities and nationalities (plus skills and finances), and seems not to place much weight on long-term integration or local schooling."
17950,"For example, calling out racism is a good thing but being objective here, how can you change the opinion of a stubborn old man?"
17951,Showing prejudice in form of racism or xenophobia never solves the issue.
17952,I can’t say i really encountered racism (aside from getting labelled as coming from prc) but I’ve heard from my friend who studied in UK before that racism is quite thriving at his area and it’s not unusual to be called “yellow pig” by the caucasians there for no valid reason.
17953,It’s important to get references (if you can) though I realise your example was the 90’s so perhaps less organised from maid agencies.
17954,"Many, many small incidences even from my own friends who don't realise they are being racist with their comments until I call them out on it."
17955,Sorry to say but your dad had the affair with the maid and he was the one 'doing funny business'.
17956,"I don't know your dad or his specific circumstance, but as the employer he wielded an enormous amount of power over the maid."
17957,It absolutely was on your dad to stop and not have sex with the maid.
17958,Putting the blame entirely on the maid is a cop out.
17959,HAD a friend who was quite racist towards Malays in secondary school!
17960,"Sorry to sound negative, but VTLs are dumb."
17961,What's the original purpose of a VTL exactly?
17962,"Then, there are plenty of non-VTL countries in Europe that have exactly same or even better covid situation as VTL countries."
17963,That goes against the initial purpose of VTLs.
17964,"Third, nobody has bothered to clearly explain how exactly a VTL flight on a Monday is different from exactly same non-VTL flight on Tuesday?"
17965,"I could also add that with 20k cases per day not just VTLs but all restrictions are meaningless, but whatever."
17966,"Let's be honest with ourselves here, VTLs are bullshit and are used by the government for their own goals (whatever those might be), not to protect anyone in Singapore."
17967,Sorry to tell you but you're racist.
17968,"Among their reasons - owner doesn't like the smell of Indian food, Indians are dirty and messy, owner prefers ""expats"" (lol read: white) - was one ludicrous gem: **Indians don't know how to use induction stove**."
17969,"They are also defending themselves against assertions, including the assertion that what they did was racist."
17970,You racist!
17971,"If, say, the scene was about laughing *at a situation* caused by the accent, I don't see anything racist about it."
17972,"If the joke was about laughing *at the accent*, then yeah that's racist and he should bitch about the script."
17973,"For all we know it could be a scene where someone laughs at his accent, then gets verbally smacked down by the others for being racist."
17974,"Sorry, I should have written, ""it *seems* racist in this context""."
17975,"It's just that because of the way Singapore is, landlord's racist wishes are not seen as unethical."
17976,I can't find any articles that investigate the maid's working conditions as you describe
17977,"Sorry, but you need to learn what it means to be racist."
17978,Saying that a language you do not speak sounds funny is simply not racist.
17979,Actually it's kind of interesting to hear how our mother tongues sound to non speakers.
17980,"* male, single, live alone in 1+bd condo       * employment pass, thus no government-sponsored retirement saving plan * My quality of life DEFINITELY has gone down (everyone's has, I'm sure!)."
17981,"It is important to contextualize studies made in other countries, especially since we are in a unique position - where we are a non-white majority country that utilize English as our primary administrative language, a language that is not that mother tongue for at least 98.6% of us."
17982,Language classes for migrant workers can also give them a platform to let their voices be heard.
17983,"Furthermore, many migrants view the language test as their first step to learning the local language](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336139238_Language_testing_and_immigration_in_Germany_three_immigrants%27_experiences_with_German_language_test)."
17984,"I agree that it is [important to define why a language test is needed for different groups of people](https://www.alte.org/resources/Documents/LAMI%20Booklet%20EN.pdf), and that many other countries are not doing their due diligence on this as well."
17985,"There are fine details to iron out and debate about, but simply dismissing the whole concept as xenophobic is unreasonable and narrow-minded."
17986,Rather than just assuming that everyone that has a different view from yours is xenophobic and has lower moral standards than your holy superior self.
17987,"You are probably going to attempt to take the moral high ground again and dismiss my comments by saying that I am unreasonable, out of touch and xenophobic."
17988,"Sorry, just to add on:  > Whatever they have experienced anecdotally does not give actual validation to any of these racist stereotypes."
17989,For a more relatable example: see  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/dlwxmg/why\_is\_there\_so\_much\_racial\_discrimination\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/dlwxmg/why_is_there_so_much_racial_discrimination_in/)   The above concerns more xenophobia than racism.
17990,Will you tell the hoteliers/landlords who've had multiple bad experiences with guests from certain demographics that they're racist?
17991,"The other comment where I used the word naive was definitely justified, as the guy suggested that Singapore would be better off if all the expats left"
17992,Sort by controversial to spot the racists
17993,"We had many maids before, had one who even physically abuse my mentally handicapped aunt."
17994,Factories like that do not add value to Singaporeans but put pressure on them by raising the cost of living with their foreign workers.
17995,We have a domestic helper in my family (hired against my wishes but who cares) and my sister is basically the type that does ZERO chores and whines about her clothes being missing or that the helper uses too much softener.
17996,She's the same person that whines how cruel people are in the news and how racist trump is and its honestly sickening to me.
17997,Sounds like a big “feel good” scam to part maids with their money.
17998,"Leong Mun Wai, Hazel Poa, Francis Yuen, Tan Cheng Bock) has ever made the claim that CECA allows **unconditional** entry of Indian professionals into Singapore."
17999,Or replace foreign workers in low end jobs like cleaners and construction workers?
18000,But this man is doubling down on his words that he is a racist and sexist cheeeebye anyways.
18001,Don’t know what the police will do but he already offended multiple races in his racist rant.
18002,Sounds like maid agencies pocketing a portion of the SHNs fees by only sending them for 3-4 days quarantine lol
18003,"Sounds like my grandpa, who is similarly narcissistic, wildly racist, verbally abusive and also a leech through his whole life on my more hardworking grandmother."
18004,"More bad news, after learning of its racist laws, some comparable to the Apartheid days."
18005,I don't think anyone here would disagree that this is a racist attack at all.
18006,"Yes I am sure there is racism, because racism is everywhere, EU, US, SG, Africa, China,... etc... humans are very much ""tribal animals""..."
18007,Sounds like you don't need a maid.
18008,Or get your mom to move in with you so the maid can help out with your chores too.
18009,"Sounds shady, might need to ask your ex maid to seek embassy clarification or read her contract"
18010,"Slowly they bought into the anti immigrant hate,  the lie that the democrats secretly want to destroy America, and now they think Trump is the savior."
18011,"No headhunter ever offered me a expat package at all, just a simimilar salary to what any local will have (and I can confirm it with my local friends)"
18012,"Eg: immigration, Of course Reddit users cannot be anti-immigrant, otherwise they ownself anti ownself."
18013,"Just Google “Singapore complaining” and get some popcorn, because their neighboring countries, expats, and even their own journalists all make fun of them for it."
18014,I like reading up on any opposition towards LKY's racist and pro-eugenics stance.
18015,Maybe you are one of those few or an expat that believes in giving a maid full day off.
18016,The household that gives maid a full 24 hour off days are usually expat.
18017,I believe we should give our foreign workers a livable condition.
18018,"No need scared people xenophobic lah, zoomers sure welcome you."
18019,"Speaking English helps immigrants better assimilate into the host country, given that English is the language connecting the 4 races"
18020,"Speaking anecdotally, every expat I know is planning on leaving by the end of the year if things don't change"
18021,"Speaking for myself, I'm not racist I'm just against double standards."
18022,Specialist tradies that might very well still depend on migrant workers lol  Like all the renovation companies these days
18023,"Our aggressive growth strategies, which allowed cheaper foreign workers, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans."
18024,Speechless to learn how naive she can be for making racist action and remark.
18025,* Singapore - Far more casual racism or think the comments are fun without thinking about other feelings.
18026,Too much stereotype (look at the other recent threads) and workplace partiality ( i don't like to call it racism) exist horribly in Singapore than any other major city I have been to.
18027,"More like people who didn't get to take advantage of the VTL pat themselves on the back, saving themselves the worry."
18028,Spending money is not a consideration for maid employer?
18029,"As a Malaysian I was raised to believe Malaysia was the worst, most 3rd world racist country that I had to escape from... till I lived in Germany."
18030,"* Gaslit by the SJWs whose culture and prevalence is very dominant in Europe that it's somehow my fault (your profile sucks, your pics not good enough, maybe you're just ugly, etc it's not ppl who are racist) when I have DATA BACKED statistics that show a MASSIVE difference for the above (1 date per year in Europe... 4-5 dates per week back in Asia) * Dead end career prospects/bamboo ceiling."
18031,"Huge ""kaki lang""/crony/racist culture among Germans... ""international"" workforce is only at the bottom of the ladder, as you go up, you'll notice management/high paying positions in most companies are majority white Germans, 2nd priority to white Europeans, with the occasional Indian, German-born Viet and American/Brit."
18032,"Japanese people seems really friendly and polite (as opposed to what my friends warn me against, of them being xenophobic), which made me really happy (then again I am Asian + tourist so yea)."
18033,Spoiler alert: you’re racist.
18034,"Even though Malays are supposedly recognized as having ""special status"" and our national language is Malay, the system has institutionalized racism against them."
18035,Just because racism isn't subtle doesn't mean it does not exist.
18036,So many threads here that DETAIL the racist experiences that minorities go through and you say that racism is rare?
18037,Called out one for not wearing a mask downstairs in my lift and he straight up accused me of being a racist?
18038,"He said he’d call the police and I would him that I’d be waiting, there’s a CCTV right outside my lift so the police would know I wasn’t lying  Always playing the race card when clearly they’re in the wrong  And unfortunately I don’t wish to generalise but I must be unlucky that most of my encounters with Indian expats seem to be negative - but hey, people will say I’m racist"
18039,The rise of xenophobia and racism can be attributed to the government’s policies.
18040,"There are many middle-income expat families who have to send their children back home to study because they can't afford a place in a private school, and no public school here will take them."
18041,Like Schroedingers immigrant lazy and squeezing and so incompetent they only have their job because of skin color - because International organisations just... hate competent Singaporeans so much they rather operate with incompetent foreigners in their best paying roles.
18042,"They act like racist fucks, call them out."
18043,"Standard price gouging, VTL is a cash injection into SQ, not a means of travel"
18044,With a racist government how can you expect the people not to be racist?
18045,Started working here 8 years ago on local contract without expat benefits and at time was quite the exception.
18046,For PAP its all GDP and numbers (look at the recent CECA debate - anything about people who have been displaced?)
18047,The act of excluding someone from being able to even have access to a part of the economy is a racist act.
18048,It is acting on a racist preference.
18049,"Statistically it is unrealistic to expect the majority of the population here to be able to compete with the top percentile of the world who are coming here as expats  That said, I'm making 6 figures in my 20s so I think I'm good enough"
18050,Stemming our racism is like asking all our fingers to be of the same length.
18051,I don’t discredit what you’ve experienced but just like to point out racism exist in every community.
18052,"Also, I don’t get why “It’s shitty to be racist on both ends but the one’s actually taking the damage are the minorities” ??"
18053,"As a Chinese, I’ve experienced racist incidents against me with especially when they are in groups, both Malay and Indian."
18054,Are actually you trying to dismiss the racist episode that I’ve experienced as invalid ?
18055,Sterile only if you hang out in sterile expat expensive areas.
18056,"Very likely to be send back, hence instead of nagging/continue to guide her as a maid, we just let her chill a bit and enjoy while she can before knowing the truth."
18057,"Still have to apply for a pass to come in, even through VTL."
18058,"While a VTL may not be possible, they should at least move them to Cat III one would think."
18059,Still not anti-immigrant at all.
18060,Just slightly less pro-immigrant.
18061,Still racism though.
18062,Still racist dude.
18063,Still remember that long rant by a supposed FDW employer that FDW are not here for holiday 🙄
18064,Preferences does not equate to racist.
18065,That domestic maids passes will be cancelled with immediate effect..
18066,Stop asking your maid to clean the window.
18067,Stop being an apologist to existing racist policies.
18068,Stop equating all xenophobia with racism.
18069,That doesn't make it racist.
18070,"Stop legal slavery, no more maids in Singapore unless in extreme scenarios"
18071,Stop parroting the West where they actually have violent racism compared to Singapore.
18072,"Let's put the ""stereotyping"" accusations aside, from 0 to 100% what's your ""non-racist"" estimate that a Korean family will buy or make kimchi at home?"
18073,"and the rise of xenophobia, in the local populance, when the exclusiveness of such benefits are  threatened, is perfectly normal."
18074,This is nothing like what you suggested about what racism means.
18075,"The problem here is people like you giving the word ""racism"" meaning based on your personal interpretation."
18076,"You don't have to scream ""racism"" to make people pay attention to racial ignorance and insensitivity."
18077,People like you should be blacklisted from ever hiring a maid.
18078,"Not to mention these maids come from poor countries where the education standard is low, and are not educated about Singapore labour laws."
18079,You have to be idiotic to think that a domestic servant for Indonesia or Myanmar would bring their savings over here to work as a maid.
18080,"Stop with the fat cat expat bullshit already, if your salary penis size is too small then do something about it."
18081,You are wrong if you think expats all make 300K/year or 25K/month... WRONG.
18082,The majority do not get paid this much... the days of the expat golden 'package' are long gone with a lot actually taking local packages but minus the CPF and other local benefits.
18083,I know for a fact that senior level locals command the same or MORE money once you factor in all the benefits given to Singaporeans vs expats.
18084,Stop your racism and xenophobia lar
18085,Straits Times viewers supporting Trump's immigration policy is expected anyway.
18086,Strange that the government reacts when it's the expats vote with their feet.
18087,"Strange,I live in Singapore all my life, and I never saw anyone abuse their maid before."
18088,"It doesnt mean maid abuse never happen, just that it is kind of rare and usually featured on news when it happens."
18089,Do you work in a maid agency or something to see it happen reguarly?
18090,My domestic helper was vaccinated a mth earlier than me.
18091,But is it really the best idea to stop calling racist incidents racist because people will tire of them being called racist?
18092,"It doesn’t help solve the issue lol  And that’s not to mention the fact that it’s not wrong to call it racist, even if it isn’t intentional."
18093,They never said anything about racism.
18094,"CECA is not the only FTA, but it is the most problematic FTA because of extra provisions."
18095,> over-concentration of foreigners in specific industries Not related to CECA at all?
18096,"But only if you do it all the time  * Make sure your work colleagues all understand how well you’re being paid, you will garner widespread respect and admiration as “foreign talent” * There is an amazing place by the river which is the perfect distillation of Singaporean history and culture plus global entertainment, it is called “Clarke Quay”, go there every chance you can."
18097,"So why is it more excusable to treat a maid, another human being this way?"
18098,"Strictly speaking almost no immigrants have a ""right"" to be in Singapore."
18099,Intent and malice and not necessary for racism to have occurred.
18100,"I was also tired of those odd incidents here and there with people being racist/ni hao/sometimes to the point of making me fear for my personal safety, and I prefer being back in SG where I feel like I belong, where I'm happy, where I can do the work that I want to do."
18101,So racism starts from birth.
18102,I don't have a maid myself but my parents have one.
18103,Recently the previous maid that was with them for 4 years?
18104,has started calling the house and asking to speak to the new maid.
18105,My aunt got one of the calls and really scolded the old maid but her calling is worrying cause there's really no reason for her to call
18106,No companies pay free money just to have foreign workers in their offices.
18107,"We cannot afford to be ""Racist and Xenophobic"", yeah, say that when locals are literally treated like second or third class vermin in the eyes of the expatriates."
18108,"Such a thoughtful employer, giving the maid protein-enriched rice."
18109,From hiring a FDW to 2015 to qualifying for CLAS now
18110,But I wouldn't even bother traveling on the VTL now.
18111,Such people should be banned from ever hiring maids and be sentenced very heavily.
18112,Suddenly all Chinese got labelled racist.
18113,"**Weighing the potential lives/convenience/essential services for society saved against the (vast) moral cost of grossly disregarding individual migrant workers' liberty, there is certainly no sensible prudential argument for keeping them locked in their dormitories and worksites at this stage of the pandemic."
18114,"Sunday: We may need to walk back and tighten due to Omicron  Monday: Full steam ahead on VTL, to hell with Omicron"
18115,"By fighting over the foreign worker and minimum wage shitshow and slamming up against PAP powerhouse Tharman, the opposition basically fizzled out what little campaign exposure they had making themselves look bad."
18116,"Super discriminating, what a racist the instructor is."
18117,The maids taking care of the kids or elderly at the coffeeshop also eat the children's leftovers.
18118,Suppose for just a second I take your premise that we are all racist.
18119,That racism is an unavoidable reality and that we should not work to change it?
18120,"Suppose we start acknowledging for a start that racism isn't blameworthy because every single person (this is what you seemed to imply) is racist to each other, almost like an innate quality."
18121,"The man is a racist, look for a decent landlord, period."
18122,"My beliefs are that systemic racism (public service/governance) should be eliminated, but I respect how business operates as long as it is legal."
18123,Also why is grace fu...coming out and saying this when they havent showed a single evidence that more people are getting increasingly racist.
18124,"Sure but there's clearly no ethical objection for a housewife having sex with her husband unlike the FDW case, and therefore the two are not equivalent."
18125,"That local sentiments are rife with xenophobic tendencies (again, inexcusable) to the extent that Changi Biz Park is renamed Chennai speaks volumes to the consequences of the trade agreement (CECA)."
18126,"Sure there is a problem, i dont deny racism dosent exist."
18127,>Chinese are not becoming racist.
18128,"Therefore your original comment didnt make sense, and obviously came with an intent to shit talk china (paired with your  r/China comments)  True and malicious racism is when 3 asian men were killed in New York by a caucasian with a hammer and recieved no jail time."
18129,"(search this sentence, lazy to link)  So yeah if China chinese are getting more racist due to the west instigating all sorts of trade wars and nonsense you know who to blame."
18130,"Clearly youre not Singaporean, coming into this sub to spread your views of China in a negative light and supposedly ""racist"" chinese people in Singapore clearly amounts to foreign interference."
18131,"Sure they do... And some migrant workers would have conveniently ""left"" the country even though they left their belongings behind."
18132,"And *none* of it needed to happen, given enlightened, sensitive, non-racist leadership."
18133,"I can't speak for the others, but my beef with the press conference yesterday throwing the suggestion out by sanctimoniously describing it as ""xenophobic"" and the whole ""do not do unto others"" bit, leaving us with no reassurance beyond reiterating that they'll be doing stringent temp screenings."
18134,"What some of us here are trying to convey is that racism and nationalism often go hand in hand, and to the target of hate, it's hard to tell the difference especially when the guilty party can't tell themselves."
18135,"It's ironic that Emmanuel uses that example, when there are other races in Malaysia feeling far, far more marginalised now, especially when their calls for equal treatment are greeted with cries of ""racist"" and ""pendatang"" from parties purporting to represent the majority ethnic group."
18136,"Sure, but they don't need a expat to teach them English"
18137,"Sure, let’s get all expats spendings and taxes away from the economy."
18138,I have many great expat friends whom I respect and work well together with.
18139,"**To Ms Eva Ho**,  Don't come up with this shit such as not seeing migrant worker's as a threat to local's job security."
18140,"Sure, you racism is excused..."
18141,"But the accusation is that the PSP has made  the claim that CECA allows ""unconditional entry""."
18142,"They will oppose the PRC on the basis of the PRC being a foreigner competing for jobs and resources, but most of the time it doesn’t cross over into explicity racist territory."
18143,"They keep the xenophobia and racism separate, like bread and unspread jam."
18144,That’s what I meant by this specific brand of xenophobia serving as a “vessel” for racism.
18145,"This mixing up of racism with xenophobia is not a uniquely Singaporean situation, btw."
18146,"Classism, racism, whichever."
18147,"I agree with your point that expats or locals can spread Covid, regardless of nationality."
18148,But muhhh brownie points and xenophobia.
18149,I didn’t say that SAP schools were the only cause of racism.
18150,All races commit acts of racism.
18151,No one is excusing racism.
18152,Surprised a Chinese was fired for racism.
18153,Surprised the headline wasn't:  > More than half of migrant workers were protected from Covid-19!
18154,Systemic racism doesn't just refer to things like bumi privilege.
18155,"All that said, if they cannot afford to treat their foreign workers with dignity they need to be held accountable."
18156,"TBH $7,000 is neither here nor there for a white-collar professional in Singapore; it's a considerable amount that will ensure a comfortable lifestyle, but certainly not enough for that ""expatty"" lifestyle (serviced apartment in Cairnhill, expensive international schools, membership to the American Club, etc.)"
18157,TBH I consider the fact that you guys have to indicate your ethnicity as 'Other' in most forms to be pretty racist in and of itself.
18158,I do not think this is a form of racism as employers will always want to hire people with the maximum number of skills at the same cost.
18159,Almost... almost paid an absurd price for a late April VTL flight with a not-so-nice airline.
18160,TIL can ask maid to massage
18161,TIL making someone uncomfortable is racism.
18162,TIL not wanting a worker's dorm near your house is racist
18163,"Of course, we can't eradicate racism entirely or at least for now but watching this just.. sucks."
18164,"I challenge you to name 10 countries with higher immigrant ratio than SG, especially when Singaporeans are cramped tighter than sardines in their own home."
18165,TIL: Singapore has a racism problem.
18166,TL;DR Average pay for a mid level expat is 300k SGD.
18167,"TL;DR:  * ~~New VTLs with Thailand, Cambodia, Fiji, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Turkey ""postponed""~~ ST was wrong, updated to say these will open as planned * Existing VTLs stay open, but will now require 2 ""supervised, self-administered"" ARTs on Day 3 and 7 after arrival"
18168,TLDR of this thread NS is a systemically racist cesspool.
18169,TLDR version of those comments: Singaporean not forgetting they are racist when the apocalypse is coming
18170,"TLDR: VTL needs pre-departure test on way back, meaning you risk getting stuck in Germany for 21 additional days at your own cost."
18171,TV show depicts migrant worker being generalized.
18172,Which is even more impressive seeing as how Singapore is both a major travel and trade hub with huge numbers of PRC tourists and expats/workers.
18173,What I'm saying here is outright insinuating that PA is *obviously racist and out to insult Malays* because of a contractor's error is kind of an odd take?
18174,Take a look at your comment history and pick out those talking about immigration and CECA.
18175,"Apart from degrading Nicole in sexual terms, many parts of their video were extremely racist against Malays and Indians."
18176,Takes a special line of asshole to underpay foreign workers who are working hard for not very much money.
18177,"Honestly, expecting your maid to come in-built with that passion and dedication is a bit much."
18178,"Taking care of elderly and children are not tasks i would outsource to maids, especially those who are unskilled (e.g."
18179,The only reason why people rely on maids to take care of the elderly and their kids is because they are dirt cheap.
18180,Yes you'll need a mother tongue to enter JC.
18181,"He told me that he had never experienced any racist harassment, not even when the Cronulla riots was happening."
18182,"Talking about foreign workers, may I appeal to all who are burning stuff and leaving food to please spare a thought for the cleaning brigade to have to deal with your aftermath."
18183,I guess the many minorities who do not agree this is an act of racism is silencing their own race and promoting systemic racial ignorance then!
18184,> But this incident has showed that the PA are many things that are worse than being “racist”.
18185,"If it makes you happy, oh well I guess this is an act of racism then."
18186,"Every single one of us here who do not think it is, is a vile, racist creature who is attempting to silence the minorities’ lived experiences and encouraging systemic racial ignorance."
18187,"Tan Cheng Bock did literally say ""among the terms of ce[sic] or CECA, allow the free movement of **professionals** in 125 un  127 sectors to enter and work in Singapore"", emphasis mine."
18188,Tbf not liking the smell of ethnic dishes is not really racism
18189,"Tbf, I feel that the examples you quoted are more of stereotypes rather than Singaporeans being racist (not saying that there aren’t racist Singaporeans)."
18190,"Filipinos can have many occupations, just so happen that in Singapore, we see more maids around."
18191,"If you say ""I'm Chinese so I dgaf"", you are basically saying that you are totally find with this racist law sticking around."
18192,passive racism
18193,"I am a millennial and me and my sisters were practically raised by our first maid who worked 10+ years for us before we all grew up and she wanted to try working in a different country, many tears were shed and we still keep in touch until today."
18194,"However, I see the boomers at my workplace with maids and it is atrocious how they treat them."
18195,One of them even made her maid wear a self bought uniform so that other maids will not speak with hers when she goes to fetch her child from school.
18196,"She even lets her child order the maid around so that her daughter knows the difference between a worker and family, it’s quite appalling really."
18197,"When I expressed my shock, she said there must be a clear distinction if not the maid will climb all over their heads."
18198,"I'm saying people shouldn't knee-jerk turn to immigration policy to blame for inequalities, they could be using their ""my day to day unhappiness with life"" line to whack at the wrong causes, like what if the main causes of the inequalities are actually a lack of minimum wage and low taxes on the rich locals?"
18199,That's just controlled racism.
18200,Tbh I see racist comments on fb all the time with tons of likes but all are almost never charged.
18201,Tbh mandarin is tough as fuck and malays and maybe even indians have it easy with their respective mother tongues
18202,Chinese and Indian immigrants that assimilate just fade into the background of Singapore society.
18203,"For 1.5 or 2gen immigrants that grew up in SG, unless we show the hanyinyin surname, you probably won't be able to tell a 2gen PRC immigrant from a 5gen Singpaorean."
18204,"Like people talk shit about PRC immigrants in front of me all the time expecting me to join in, without realising that I'm 2gen myself and that I can't possibly join in right wth these are my parents (and to some extent myself) youre talking about leh."
18205,"These people could all be assimilated immigrants, but peoole will never register this as evidence that immigrants assimilate."
18206,The only immigrants that do catch our attention are the ones who don't assimilate.
18207,"Not that it's anyone's fault that this is how our minds work, but I think it's a sad reality that people seem to drastically underestimate how many of their friends colleagues and family members have an immigrant background but just aren't noticed because they've assimilated."
18208,And when they make certain unfair or over generalised attacks about immigrants they are also inadvertently hurting their friends families and colleagues.
18209,"Tbh, I think most ordinary Singaporeans could care less whether expats are bored or if they want to go back home."
18210,"Tbh, the pay of foreign worker may seem Low, but you must consider the levy and the housing of the foreign worker."
18211,"That's how you create a race-based class hierarchy, expat enclaves and a transient population treating Singapore as their playground, not true diversity."
18212,I don’t think the racism will stop.
18213,Technically maids are not supposed to wash cars.
18214,"But which migrant worker dare to demand anything from a minister, let alone get an audience from one on top of a high horseback?"
18215,"Technically yes based on my understanding of the Germany VTL, but considering land borders do not have immigration within the EU AFAIK I don't really see how this can be enforced"
18216,But you’re not permitted to use the VTL if you’ve not been in Germany for 21 consecutive days immediately before departure.
18217,"But in practice, any one of us would still be labelled as an immigrant by the locals were we to head over to, say, the UK on an expat package."
18218,"Tell this to dual income families with children in Tokyo, HK, Seoul or Melb/Sydney... do you see them relying on live in maids as much as we do?"
18219,"Tell your maid what is safe and expected of her (like just wipe the inside for example), if you're sincere about your disapproval of the dangerous part of the window cleaning."
18220,"Sounds inherently unsafe, possibly in humane, to allow foreign workers to sit at the back of lorries."
18221,Nothing is being done for this girls and nobody seems to care as maid mistreatment is commonplace nowadays.
18222,Test non VTL for what when still have to do shn regardless of result?
18223,The idea is to prevent community spread so makes sense to have VTL test daily as they are free to go out and about.
18224,The MMTF cannot have R > 1 ok else 50% cannot go back to office on 3 jan /s   Not to mention 75% of imported cases arrived on VTL so how is VTL safer than non VTL?
18225,"It’s potentially cos VTL flights are more packed but goes to show that designating VTL and non VTL flights is completely pointless, but that’s a different argument altogether"
18226,Tfw someone says “how can I be a racist?
18227,In few days gov will release the detail of VTL.
18228,Hopefully they will make the domestic flights easier for VTL visitors 😁
18229,Only 1 out of 2 mass shooters in the last 24 hours is confirmed to be racist.
18230,The expat women I know all want to work.
18231,"So if I were to approach a Bangladeshi (like some of the foreign workers), and call them ""bangla"", they won't be offended yea?"
18232,Treating domestic helpers with politeness and as equals should be commonplace.
18233,A concept many people in Singapore fail to grasp when it comes to their domestic helpers.
18234,And thanks for thinking of the maid's living space and taking it into appropriate consideration.
18235,"If you can't afford to give your maid a separate bedroom(a room with a window and that's not cupboard and closet sized) --- you can't afford a live-in maid, period!"
18236,"At the same time, many of these expats are also victims caught up in the backlash."
18237,"Beyond parents, I really do feel like schools really need to revamp the social harmony aspect of their curriculum because a lot of normalisations of actions, such as casual racism, probably develop at a young age."
18238,I guess your sharing just further emphasises the need for us to really think how to minimise such normalisation/instances of racism in order for us to really call ourselves a first world society.
18239,"Thank you for saying that, it’s stuff like this that gives me hope that Singaporean Chinese people aren’t all racists."
18240,"as if all Indians come from villages, such a disgusting and racist phrase."
18241,Yes open racism is not okay  here but there are many people who think that casual racism is okay.
18242,On so many occasions I have called out my parents racist comments but it never get to their head.
18243,I am trying to raise children that are not racist.
18244,"To be honest, when I was younger, I too participate in such casual racism."
18245,I won't say that I am totally free of racist stereotype but the first step is really to recognise that I have  such tendency and address it whenever I find myself going along those line of thinking.
18246,[2 migrant workers died](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/pie-accident-second-migrant-worker-dies) by the same mode of transportation as what I've used before.
18247,But you know why this racism comes about?
18248,LHL captured the sentiment perfectly in his National Day rally - SG is an egalitarian society and expat Indians bring their classism to SG.
18249,"And to make it worse, there have been incidents where a few people have given the whole Indian expat community a bad name."
18250,"Also, people who have engaged with this racist and have horrible experiences, I sincerely hope you have the courage to come forward too."
18251,All the best to all of you (not to the racist of course.
18252,"It’s especially appalling how much racism is present in schools, and how little teachers do to curb systemic racism."
18253,"Things are changing I feel, but probably too slowly - especially for someone like you who has been on the receiving end of racism for so long."
18254,Thank you for standing against racism and resolving to speak up in the future.
18255,Do you know of any expats who have ended up in trouble with the law for accidentally breaking a law?
18256,How do the local police view expats?
18257,In my situation I'm about to resign my job in Australia based on the In Principle letter which I guess is a leap of faith if the MoM has an issue giving me an employment pass card?
18258,"That way of grouping may have made sense in a less globalised world, but not so much now that so many countries have immigrants."
18259,>multiracialism is not a natural condition and requires constant work to maintain  I like this analogy from Scott Woods that compares racism to water leaking into a boat.
18260,"I am an expat, not in sg though."
18261,I agree that Bangladeshis receive a lot of racism.
18262,Hopefully VTL spots will open up so more of us can enjoy that too.
18263,"With that said, I believe in improving the working conditions of foreign workers here."
18264,"Allowing a better livable space in dormitory, giving maids 24 hours off days is not a farfetch improvement, with proper planning and management."
18265,That is already higher than the percentage of foreign workers in Singapore.
18266,"***  For some reason, many believe hiring foreign talents in a 0 sum game."
18267,You mention that foreign talents depress wages; this is not necessarily true.
18268,Hiring foreign talents creates more jobs than it takes away.
18269,If you restrict universities/companies in hiring foreign talent; the consequences are dangerous.
18270,Companies can choose to move headquarters - taking away far more jobs than the foreign talents they hire.
18271,PS: I understand there are two times of foreign works in Singapore; in referring to foreign talents; I am only talking about those with an Employment pass.
18272,"This whole CECA issue, imo, is that the Indians, a minority race, are suddenly getting all the jobs."
18273,The maid is your employee.
18274,"I hear some people talking about confiscating maids HPs and cancelling off day as 'punishment'... wow, modern day slavery."
18275,"Every day I will come across at least a handful of xenophobic comments on PRCs and Indian immigrants, often with little basis in reality."
18276,These xenophobic assholes have zero regard for the fact that they are attacking the family members and friends of Singaporeans.
18277,Especially the part about how the bigots in the comments just back the racist comments up.
18278,"In many cases, whenever I tried to speak out on racism I get shut down so hard by them and the worst part is how they try to justify it."
18279,"As for definitions, in short, 'foreign workers' are unskilled migrant workers hoping to find better living conditions and jobs, 'foreign talent' are highly educated migrant workers."
18280,"Those groups are indeed unlikely to mix, so maybe I'll rephrase my research question more to focus on the relationship/conflict between foreign workers and locals, and/or foreign talent and locals."
18281,"But yes the maid's human too, how can they deny her of her basic needs."
18282,I really hope for the best for the maid mans.
18283,"Coming back to Chong Siew Leng, It is likely that her mother, my great-great-grandmother (who had her feet bound) was an immigrant to Malaya, making Chong Siew Leng first generation Malay Chinese."
18284,Thank you very much foreign workers.
18285,The mum’s racism lost her child an experienced tutor.
18286,"• VTL added expense $600   • Flight $678 (booked right when VTL announced, I think it soared later)   • Hotel $532 (literally booked when I landed in airport because the situation was so volatile 😔)  • Travel stipend $1000 (placeholder."
18287,[CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-new-cases-linked-clusters-s11-dormitory-12621514) has kindly noted the correction  >Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect corrected numbers issued by MOH on the total number of cases at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.
18288,What sort of industries do younger expats typically work in?
18289,"Thank you, Bridget, for your good work at HOME and for sharing the plight of migrant workers with Singaporeans so early on."
18290,I’m often quick to say they are being racist without really explaining why - I just assume they know.
18291,The expectations for the maid is out of this world.
18292,"It weighed on our marriage for a while because my focus was care of our then 1 year old, that if she does it well enough and out child is happy with the maid then other issues like cooking can be slowly improved."
18293,"We let the maid go but then took her back a few months after because the replacement wasnt nearly as liked by our child and even her, surprised Pikachu face."
18294,In fairness to my wife she adjusted over the last year and our maid is now going 5 years with us and practically part of the family.
18295,Now when her friends boast about how amazing their new maid is I just.
18296,"Don't get me wrong there are truly truly bad maids, our short term one was."
18297,"I lived in a pretty sheltered environment all my life, so even though I'm a minority I still subscribed to the myth that racism did not exist in SG."
18298,"In the positive ads they try to use CMIO, for negative characters they usually use a generic chinese dude."
18299,I promise to speak up against racism when I see it.
18300,There is also the matter of foreign workers to consider.
18301,You are a very cute too as a foreign talent :))
18302,"Thanks for curing racism, Circles."
18303,"If it is not too invasive, can I ask what kind of housing do you live at, and how do you get the chance to interact with the migrant workers, other than TWC2 as a platform (and perhaps the Little India area)?"
18304,"The context is that I noticed that most Bangladeshi workers are living in dormitories far away from the rest of the usual hdb towns - was wondering how the geographical networks are like for migrant workers, and whether there’s any form of housing discrimination that led to the situation of these workers staying in dormitories?"
18305,"If you wanted to hire one in 1st world countries, you'd have to spend 3000sgd+   I hope Singapore will one day grow out of the 600sgd maids and foreign workers ferried around on the back of a lorry."
18306,Thanks for letting me know just how prevalent racism is.
18307,"I'm really surprised by it because I didn't really encounter a lot of racism (maybe a bit in primary school) and then realised it could be due to the fact that I'm not the most social person, and that I went through the IP system after pri school ( which may have students who are generally more aware of racism and less ignorant)."
18308,"But the truth is, they will soon realise that teachers are probably only doing 10% of teaching and 90% doing some other jobs, like event manager, finance manager, logistic manager, 'maid', 'circus trainer', 'baby sitter', data entry clerk, IT expert, counsellor, performer, safety officer, instructor, sports and life coach, handyman, relationship manager, first aider and the list goes on and on."
18309,A = '*systematic racism against Malays*'; B = *'disparity in economic and education status between Malay and Chinese*'.
18310,"And that's the thing I'm also unhappy with, the govt is also promoting and perpetuating this racism."
18311,Prepare yourself for racist encounters?
18312,"In my experience, accents became noticeable only when the new Chinese and Indian immigrants came."
18313,"We have always been told that the situation is under control, and that help is being rendered to these migrant workers from multiple agencies and organisations."
18314,"More often than not, MSM tend to portray “feel good stories” when reporting about these migrant workers."
18315,"I get that with such painful experience, it’s impossible not to make connection when you see things resemble racism."
18316,I honestly didn’t make the racism connection when first watching the video - just a very intolerant and bad-mannered lady to me.
18317,"Despite what’s in the lady’s mind, I’m glad that this incident has led to the valuable sharing and discussion we had about racism awareness."
18318,"Thanks for speaking the truth, calling out racism is important even if it’s “far far away” or in your home."
18319,Thanks for standing up to the apologism and dismissal of problematic behaviour like casual racism as some self-indulgent esoteric idea.
18320,"Thanks for teaching me the word ""racial tolerance""  It sums up so much racist behavior so well"
18321,That's why expats should not be prioritised.
18322,"But sectors that have relied of migrant workers to generate growth have lagged behind in productivity, and one could argue that this disincentivised firms to drive up productivity and move up the value chain."
18323,"If we boost productivity significantly in these sectors, we can trim the number of local workers needed to replace foreign workers."
18324,"The pay disparity and the 12 people in a room thing seems like legit issues to be tackled though, but I suppose when we go down that route we also need to look at the pay of maids as well👀"
18325,"The racial bias runs immensely deep, and the disenfrenchising effects of racist colonial policies is still felt today with the Malay community lagging behind in income and education attainment, but topping in things like drugs."
18326,Your hypothesis is that Singapore systemic minority racism is the main cause cannot satisfactorily explain the disparity between the racial groups.
18327,Please note that I am NOT claiming that systematic minority racism does not exist in Singapore.
18328,"While growing up in Singapore, I've never encountered racism (except jibs and some heated taunts) where a person from a minority race was stripped of what they could have, because of their race."
18329,"Most of us are caught up with our day to day, and sometimes it's those who have the chance to mingle with people from the Malay communities, Indian communities and so on, to tell us whether there is systemic racism."
18330,Just one thing – perhaps you may wish to say maid employers rather than maid owners.
18331,Nobody owns a maid.
18332,"As for your examples, wow, that is some racist bullshit!"
18333,I guess I'm just going to have to see whom I gel with once the move happens since I'm not going to be actively looking at maintaining a local vs. expat friendship quota.
18334,Singaporeans vs other countries citizens feel there is less racism and less crime here.
18335,We already know this is true except for maybe the racism part but asking Chinese about racism when they're the majority and don't experience it isn't great.
18336,"Interesting that factors such as age and education level seem to play a much larger role in the perception of frequency of racism than race itself, e.g."
18337,"I do consider the family in the wrong due to what I have been told and heard directly on the phone, and unfortunately it's the reality for many maids in Singapore."
18338,"&#x200B;  Not quite the same for expats, foreigners can withdraw after 10 years without penalties"
18339,"Another indirect statement, made in the middle of an hour long interview with some stammering (and I'd highlight that this statement on being ""blind to racism"" appears to be with reference to a ""comment down there"", rather than the incident)."
18340,"The main posts quite conspicuously contain no mention of racism, and I'd personally interpret the other statements with this context in mind."
18341,"So even if we were to accept that (1) she did at some point accuse the PA of racism, (2) this accusation was unfair, and (3) it wouldn't be a horrible PR move for the PA to claim the moral high ground after being the initial wrongdoer, was this a proportionate reaction from the PA?"
18342,Do indirect accusations of racism warrant the cancellation of a meeting and a public press statement?
18343,There are a lot of people who aren't fully aware of the subtle/not so subtle racism and systems of privilege that exist here in sg as well!
18344,These enquiries (which were triggered by seeing a post or share of the issue on instagram) then led them to find out about this and ponder over the issue of racism both abroad and here.
18345,"Thanks for the reply, the maid agency was the first we contacted, but it is no help,  they're siding with the host family, telling her she can't leave until she pays back the $2000, and not working on trying to find any viable solution."
18346,"Letting foreign talents in is a good thing in itself, you basically get a fully educated, experienced person FREE OF CHARGE (Education cost, health care etc...) that will bring a lot to the economy and to society."
18347,Some expat is dropped at a high position in your company?
18348,Same thing with the migrant workers.
18349,"But in this case, PA, a government body whose work is dealing with the community of all races, who when hosting an event, had to clear multiple level of approvals, minimally director level, who had previous issues of racial incidents, can we really say there's no form of racism or systemic racism?"
18350,"If one is ignorantly racist, not learning from previous incidents, wouldn't one question, hey, why have you not learnt, are you really racist?"
18351,I have already met  some expats that I think give us a bad name.
18352,"Definition: [https://sites.psu.edu/academy/2016/09/11/three-levels-of-racism/](https://sites.psu.edu/academy/2016/09/11/three-levels-of-racism/)  The reason why I find a need to define the level of discrimination, its because we need to identify the right solution to the identified level of racism."
18353,I can elaborate on how I feel we should face each level of racism.
18354,"you blame the constituency, the structures, the system we have by saying its institutionalized racism."
18355,It sucks to see so many nice people unknowingly feed to the racism because they didn't know any better.
18356,"I do speak a bit of mandarin and work at a Chinese company, so I like to think I'm less insulated than some expats."
18357,I personally have never endorsed our maid culture.
18358,"While there are likely genuine instances where families require the additional help, my stance with domestic help has always been: maids for the chores; we manage our own family members."
18359,Which is why I can never understand families who leave babies and young children alone at home with maids.
18360,"So I can't imagine how exhausted some of these maids must be, having to care for family members during the day, while cooking for the family, completing household chores and often times, still having to care for the same family members in / throughout the night."
18361,"Our domestic helpers deserve better protections, and I advocate starting with external accommodations (akin to worker dorms), to ensure maids are not manipulated into labouring for extended periods of time."
18362,"It's the most basic yet important step, since it not only protects their time, but also opens direct channels for agencies to frequently touch base with their maid population for basic welfare checks."
18363,Thanks man you just solved racism.
18364,"Thanks to all the useless housewives who tell their children that foreign workers resting at HDB void decks during their allocated breaks are ""useless""."
18365,I guess you took one of the first TK54 VTL flights after 16 December 2021.
18366,"It seems only the first link mentions foreign workers, and as far I can tell the only prescription is this  > Singapore must be prepared for a quantum leap in the level of prefabrication with an accompanying high level of standardisation."
18367,The benefit will be a sharp decrease in the dependence on foreign workers.
18368,Was the point you mentioned about migrant workers having lower productivity than other workers globally also from BCA?
18369,The concern is that some schools have the reputation of a culture that actively discourages students from speaking mother tongue other than English.
18370,"That $14,000 should go to the main + pay the maid the lost salary."
18371,We have vaccinated more than 90% of our migrant workers.'
18372,That *is* education in a manner that racists can understand.
18373,"That and Indonesia pls  Edit: they just impose travel restrictions on ASEAN countries, Japan, UK etc  Source: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-residents-advised-to-defer-all-non-essential-travel-for-next-30-days-as-part-of"
18374,With a history of persistent xenophobia and racism?
18375,"This manifested into two parts: the migrant worker's issue and their living arrangement, and the snitching society where it is a social norm (if not self-imposed responsibility) to take pictures to shame or punish the others."
18376,That can be a long term solution but I think the problem being highlighted is that in the very short term we just don't have enough workers working in Singapore to complete existing projects due to border closures.
18377,"Or maybe we should just rip off this bandaid once and for all, and let those companies that can't survive without low wage foreign workers go under, as a form of shock therapy to our construction industry."
18378,Is that racist or do we consider that respecting religious beliefs?
18379,That confirms racism.
18380,"As all those anecdotal things and if looks like racism, sounds like racism."
18381,A lot of singaporeans are similarly hit hard by this but unlike expats we don't really have a good choice of moving out (we could become expats in other countries but most of the population doesn't really have the option or attitude for it)
18382,That doesn't make sense if it's immigrants though.
18383,"That doesn't solve anything, that just means employment pass holders will be paid more than locals!"
18384,One would think that someone who experienced racism would be just as indignant when other situations occur and they should be up in arms about this as well.
18385,That is 100% racist you twat.
18386,But it does not explain why the government is willing to overlook certain kinds of racism but rebuke other kinds of racism.
18387,"We can improve, yes but we can't just outright and say cancel maid industry or LUL get your child to take care of your elderly easy."
18388,Singaporeans still won't get those lucrative jobs that are usually taken by your expats (because these companies would conduct an actual global talent search) and we get brain drain from capable Singaporeans who are able to emigrate elsewhere.
18389,"That is a symptom of their home environment giving off racist attitudes, to which the kids then adopt."
18390,But the association of easily identifiable characteristics like skin color or accent with those social class traits is what makes it racism.
18391,"The current policy tries to straddle the chasm between that, it's a 'compromise' but many people feel that one can or should not compromise on human rights -  which is a very valid and righteous position to take, but discounts the long term political reality that such changes have the potential of causing massive pendulum swings into the opposite direction when enacted (see loss of lbgt rights under Trump, massive increase in open racism, etc.)."
18392,"Look at the US and it's battle with racism and understand that lasting changes in society are really, really tough and slow and if they are enacted while the silent counter faction is too powerful, they have a serious chance of not working."
18393,"If that is not racism, then you need your brain re-examined."
18394,"Economists widely agree that immigration and free trade is a good thing, and yet we see, not just in Singapore, a rising tide of xenophobia, protectionism, and nativism."
18395,"In the context of Singapore, Chinese Singaporeans face neither explicit racism: casually racist remarks like what OP said, nor implicit racism: systemic racism limiting access and growth of minorities into certain educational, occupational and government branches + more."
18396,"Also, prejudice =/= racism."
18397,"That is if you are able to get a bus ticket via land VTL, though they should open up the land border pretty soon."
18398,"That is just a vocal minority and also the complaint is much more nuanced than locals=good, expats=bad."
18399,That is no excuse for racism tho right?
18400,I tell my maid to use a condom when she sees her man.
18401,Just like saying old people are nationalist and racist is also a generalisation.
18402,"I think it more about ""entitled privilege"" than just racism."
18403,I am not saying she was not a racist.
18404,She was a racist.
18405,"That is shit, and its not just individuals whom treat maids poorly, most of the rooms in hdbs and condos dedicated to maids are so small and poorly ventilated!"
18406,"The view that ""white"" people enjoy better socioeconomic status is primarily based on the perception of greater spending power (expat, high salary, rich etc)."
18407,Not every decision made using race as a proxy is racist.
18408,"If i prefer a german contractor instead of bangladeshi one and I specifically said I want a ""german"" one (spelled out by race), is that racist even though I prefer the german one because I trust german engineering?"
18409,People misunderstand the *mention* of race to necessarily be racist.
18410,"If that's the case, everything we do or say would be racist."
18411,"and therefore fears the opinions of the masses and “populism” (whether its problematic undercurrents of xenophobia, legitimate issues of discrimination and inequality, or anything in between) in favour of pursuing policies espoused by the well educated, cosmopolitan, “establishment”, wonks that essentially constitute our government scholars."
18412,"However, note that S pass holders who leave their current employment within the period of their first S pass likely will never be granted an In Principle Approval by MOM again unless there were extremely valid reasons for resigning."
18413,That is very sad that many foreign workers are infected.
18414,Will Singapore government extend the circuit breaker if majority of the cases are foreign workers on work permit?
18415,"For the foreign workers, they are mostly quarantining in government-specified places now so spread to the community is limited."
18416,"The term ""racism"" should be used only for incidents where there are ""clear and proven"" intent of racist behaviours (i.e."
18417,"That is why I don't support people hiring domestic workers, because I believe everybody should clean their own shit."
18418,My toilet was done by another foreign worker from another country.
18419,That is why there is a different if what he said was racism or pure statistical statement.
18420,"It would be different , if we just stereotype or racist if we claim Chinese love to eat chicken without any facts  Right ?"
18421,"Yes, there is a lot of passive racism in Singapore."
18422,"That isnt racism, but it is still terrible."
18423,"But then she went one step further to accuse Singapore of *racism*, and even bribery!"
18424,"And remember, she has THREE cases to prove here:  1) racism that led to shorter jail sentences  2) bribery  3) specific targetting and harassment of mosque leaders  *P.S."
18425,Some really great stand-up comedians get a pass for saying racist things.
18426,The boyfriend was a freaking saint for not straight up punching the racist guy after he disrespects his girlfriend.
18427,That makes me and my wife foreign workers then.
18428,"They are already overwhelmed with the existing VTL requirements - at CDG there was a 30-45mins wait in the line for SQ priority check-in, this doesn’t usually happen."
18429,"That my point, according to my mum she isn't well taken care of, despite the liberty the domestic helper is being given.."
18430,"That one not racism ma, that one is political and not racial in nature ~~\~\_\~~~ ^(/s)"
18431,"That pledge is said for the sake of being said, no actual reason to hold its purpose for racist people."
18432,That poor maid.. I’m glad she got an additional payment of $10k.
18433,"That pun was tortured,just like the maid."
18434,CECA has been a thorn in their anus and I'm pretty sure they would've loved to avoid this whole debacle if they could.
18435,"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-pacific-rim-psychology/article/racism-and-the-pinkerton-syndrome-in-singapore-effects-of-race-on-hiring-decisions/5924D22CCF6F71558B5DE9002CDBA12F)  The gist of it is, discrimination in hiring is generally in favour of one's own races and against others (e.g."
18436,"Again, as a foreigner here, I have seen and experienced the casual racism here."
18437,"Our maid started to struggle with our Math as we got towards the end of primary school, but I recall being able to go to her for everything up to that point."
18438,"I assume that a maid in your future is a likelihood, if not already the case?"
18439,The reasons to stop us from socializing is the same as for FDW
18440,That suggests more ignorance to me rather than racism?
18441,That the country's racist.
18442,"That they are discriminated against because of nationality despite being basically Japanese in every other way, while allowing your very narrow definition of xenophobia."
18443,"Nobody's saying it's right to discriminate against Chinese but it sickens me that the incident reported is now being used to cheapen minorities lived experiences with facing discrimination because ""see, we Chinese also got people racist against us so STFU with your problems""."
18444,And it has less to do with racism as it is the company you keep.
18445,It's a ridiculous display of racism.
18446,We are an immigrant country by necessity and the makeup of our populace will mirror that - the rojak remains but the sauce changes.
18447,That is racism.
18448,That will just be called out as racism no?
18449,"In this current political climate, it will require a herculean effort to do so and honestly, emotional pitches for the welfare of migrant workers don't have any significance to the PAP's core base of older, white collar and conservative of voters."
18450,Are you gonna compensate the owner when the maid sweeps up all the valuables and skip town  while you are at work?
18451,That would be amazing to me it's not clear in the article as it's referencing VTL throughout.
18452,"That's ""xenophobic"" rather than racist :P"
18453,"That's Minute Boiled Maid  Boiled Minute Maid is simply a really small maid, boiled."
18454,"Of these, [986k are work permit holders](http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/Pages/default.aspx#fp): maids, construction workers, and other unskilled workers."
18455,"Besides, VTL is bilateral, takes two hands to clap."
18456,"You're completely correct that domestic helpers aren't a substitute for a proper nurse, but sometimes there just isn't any choice or any system."
18457,"CCL long-term dormitory borrowings equalled 56.9% of their value in 2019, whereas at the three REITs the amount was far lower."
18458,"Coming to parliament and just throwing baseless opinions, like in LMW's case was at times explicit and xenophobic!"
18459,"That's a lot of words to say ""You should be thankful we not as racist as other angmoh countries."""
18460,You know FDWs aren't teenage children right?
18461,"Among the migrant workers who tested PCR-positive or serology-positive, the vast majority were asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms."
18462,"Only about 1 in 5 of migrant workers living in PBDs presented with symptoms, with the remaining 4 in 5 displaying very mild or no symptoms."
18463,Do you think Americans treat non-resident migrant workers better?
18464,"Personally, I don't think its racist."
18465,"Again, I don't think its racist but rather a ""lost in translation"" type of thing."
18466,"Though if they really were being racists, then her actions were definitely justified."
18467,Then again I'm not sure what the mind of a racist is like so I can't speak for them.
18468,Not invalidating any of your experiences nor am I condoning racism.
18469,"Just like the issue with nasi padang, most don't attribute it to racism, even though technically it could possibly be."
18470,"Of course, if it's a serious issue caused by racism please call that shit out."
18471,"According to online sources, the Indian government threatened to take any revisions to CECA from SG to the WTO."
18472,Obviously CECA isn't as amazing as we'd thought.
18473,Many people I know do not follow the religion of their parents (lots of Christian converts in SG) but they certainly speak their mother tongue.
18474,Yet people who are not the migrant workers are complaining and make it seem so bad.
18475,"So in this situation, which I'm sure happens a lot, the expats WOULD be earning more than the locals, isn't it?"
18476,I wonder how many of the people commenting things like that also stand up for minorities who face racism on a daily basis.
18477,"That's funny because your ""nobody I know has cited paying less tax as a reason for coming back"" is so reminiscent of Jo Teo's ""no foreign worker has asked me for an apology""."
18478,"It just has a different name now, called ""casual racism""."
18479,"Since you clearly have the migrant workers' interest at heart, why are you criticising others who are trying to help them out?"
18480,Although I will concede that 100% of maids do work from home.
18481,"That's great, as for that ""someone"", that's really bad and frankly should be reported as it violates maid employment law."
18482,It only became more convenient for maids to open bank accounts in March.
18483,"But some maids do prefer cash, their hangouts are still mainly cash based, and their preferred remittance methods are also cash based"
18484,"That's incredibly racist, I am ashamed for your experience."
18485,"If we are an immigrant nation, why should we be close minded to new immigrants, especially those truly trying to integrate into our society?"
18486,"And it's true that there are people who think my gf is a maid or mail order bride, although they wont display it overtly, especially in front of me."
18487,That's indeed a VTL flight (hence 4 Covid tests.
18488,"If he was a white expat, he wouldn't be facing the same issues"
18489,So the locals are more annoyed with the low skilled immigrants coming here to do eg construction?
18490,Did Singapore allowed Indians and Malays to take O and A Levels in their own mother tongue as well?
18491,I could see a weak mother tongue score pulling down their aggregate down.
18492,As for ostracization I have not figure out at all but I know police is definitely not the place while for racist it is.
18493,That's kind of why I decided to go all in on English in school since my Mandarin was atrocious and I decided that I didn't need to do well in mother tongue for O Levels.
18494,Most of the comments from that thread are racism towards minorities.
18495,Minorities in Singapore would probably have to face less racism in the West when compared to singapore.
18496,"In my experience, the racism that I faced in sg is mainly from the low-middle ses."
18497,Most of the people I've met in uni are at least upper middle from what I can tell and not once have I heard a racist comment from them.
18498,That's legalized racism.
18499,"Systemic racism doesn't have to involve the law or the government, but it *does* have to involve society."
18500,It's the *normalization* of racism that I was trying to point out.
18501,"Race-based barriers to employment, if *seen as normal* (ie not unusual or alarming), is absolutely an example of systemic racism."
18502,"It's not just a handful of members of society with a racist mindset, but that these hypothetical members of society can openly display that racism (however blatant or veiled), and it is accepted and propagated by others in that society."
18503,"This is in contrast to structural racism, which is when the interactions between institutions and assumptions in society results in racially problematic outcomes."
18504,"This then becomes systemic racism if the people behind the algorithm go ""meh, not an issue""."
18505,"That's like 2.5% of the total of 200,000 foreign workers in dorm lockdown."
18506,That's like saying Jihadist is political and not because they're xenophobic jealous racist scums who just wanted an excuse to justify the killing and raping of innocent people.
18507,"That's like saying all the icons show male (or unknown) persons so I'm right to say ""men get so upset when they see non Chinese featured in banners, racist pui""."
18508,Many Singaporeans are that racist.
18509,"*So yes, people from minority races can be prejudiced, and can say things that are racist towards a member of the majority race, but what that member of the majority experiences isn’t “reverse racism”, because we aren’t experiencing an entire system of oppression."
18510,Which is why I think living overseas for a period of time would definitely help me see the feasibility of me (an immigrant) retiring like that.
18511,"Unless of course, you're just being racist."
18512,That's no excuse for racism in an adult.
18513,"But no, according to this thread PA is *obivously* racist."
18514,"""There is no racism, people are just too sensitive nowadays..."""
18515,The maids also need to be assured that there will not be any repercussions against them.
18516,Does that make him a racist for choosing to hire qualities he sees fit in his kitchen ?
18517,"That's not the maid's fault and what's with the ""matter of fact"" assumption that she will run away?"
18518,"Ostensibly to provide training for ""developing"" countries, Japan takes on a lot of unskilled migrant workers to ""train"" them with skills to bring home."
18519,The problem isn't the top 50% of employers who treat their maids decently.
18520,"The problem is the rest who are emotionally abusive, make their maids sleep in tiny storerooms, and expect them to work 24/7."
18521,"That's only because India has a much larger population and most of them have never even been on a domestic flight, let alone an international flight...  You discounted the role of CECA and it's relevance to the discriminatory hiring practices that go on in certain 'enclaves' and got overtly defensive about a nationality you seem to have run away from."
18522,"If it is with racist intent, and we judge it as a minor slight and let it go."
18523,That's part of the problem with allowing FDWs in general.
18524,"The employer's home is basically a black hole - maids can't really head out without permission, phone usage can be curtailed, and many keep the maid's passports despite that being illegal."
18525,I have zero illusions about Japanese xenophobia
18526,"It's not like they're local workers who can just say no and still have a house and a right to be here, foreign workers take on thousands of dollars in debt just to be here and live in fear of being sent back for saying no to anything."
18527,"But in any case, these are all instances of racism."
18528,But I think everyone should be sensitive at least when the topic is literally about a very racist incident.
18529,That's racist
18530,That's racist!
18531,That's racist.
18532,"That's right, a Prime Minister trying to stop illegal immigrants flooding into the country by vigorously enforcing the law is such a cunt-y thing to do."
18533,"There's quite a number of property ads that specify ""no Indian"", ""no prc"", or even ""expats only""."
18534,"There are sometimes genuine experiences behind this, but I can only describe it as racist - generalizing that all persons from a country are the same."
18535,That's still a migrant worker no?
18536,"For instance, Singaporeans hired as expats to other countries get CPF topups."
18537,It's there to prevent employers from exploiting vulnerable maids by arbitrarily putting costs of employment like healthcare costs on them.
18538,And for fuck's sake maids are paid a pittance already.
18539,If you can't hire a maid without doing illegal shit and exploiting them then don't hire a maid.
18540,"That's the prevailing opinion that a lot of people, both locals and expats, seem to have."
18541,"You can hire maids to pine sol or spam baking soda on the whole place but the odor gets permanently embedded into all the curtains, furniture, walls and in the appliances."
18542,"That's true, but the way he made the comment made it sound as if all those who include ""Chinese proficiency required"" are just racists who don't accept minorities."
18543,"But, I'm just saying in a neutral way, that many expats don't really come here to socialize or experience Singapore."
18544,That's what all expats say about Singapore
18545,Sometime I think we should just not have a maid for a few years until my parents are older and then we'll hire a live-in nurse.
18546,"That's what you get when maids are seen as second class objects, people get fined and jailed harsher for abusing animals."
18547,That's why I did away with my maid.
18548,That's why I think it's a relatively new practice that could be a by-product of the influx of expats from the western hemisphere.
18549,"That's why I try to stay clear of the ""racist"" label if possible."
18550,Complicity should not be conflated with racism.
18551,That's why I will never hire a maid for myself.
18552,That's why countries like Myanmar are banning their female citizens from going to other countries to work as domestic workers (many still make their way over despite the bans though).
18553,"Nowhere as bad as Hong Kong, but domestic worker abuse over here is pretty prominent too."
18554,"Singapore should do away with the term 'maid' completely, too."
18555,"There's a good reason why the Ministry of Manpower avoids using the term, but agencies and media continue to use it blatantly ([ST even has a tag for it](https://www.straitstimes.com/tags/maids))."
18556,That's why racism still exist in Singapore.
18557,People went to NS to know that there are no difference but sadly there are Singaporean who still want to be racist
18558,That's why they came to Singapore to be an expat lol
18559,That's without VTL.
18560,"With VTL that won't be the case, unless an employer is particularly anal"
18561,That's xenophobia also right.
18562,"Just because the other guy was racist, doesn't mean OP should handle him that level"
18563,I should mention that there is another benefit of using foreign workers - it allows dynamic scaling to the condition of the economy the same way AWS provides scalability to digital businesses.
18564,"I'm arguing against simplistic slogans and cheap populist fixes being sold right now by xenophobic assholes who see a chance to spread their simplistic, destructive toxic world view by preying on the legitimate fear of people in an economic recession."
18565,"Plus from the article, netizens mentioned the maid shouldnt complain and wash the rice and eat it."
18566,"I can guarantee you that rice was specifically bought for the maid, since no singaporean would want to eat that, they would rather throw it since its been contaminated."
18567,But it seems its ok for maid consumption.
18568,"In any case, we are not saying, all Chinese people are racist."
18569,"In fact, the majority of the minorities are well aware that most Chinese are not racist or atleast do not have hate (some do have ignorance)."
18570,"We just want you to understand that as an anti-racist Chinese, you have the power and privelage as the Majority to effect some change towards a better society."
18571,"To educate folks within your community when you encounter bigoted views within private spaces, to check within your office, school or social places, if structures of discrimination exist and to question those structure, and to call out casual racism wherever it happens."
18572,It is alot easier for someone of Chinese race to call out casual racism coming from a Chinese than for the only minority in that group.
18573,The statements that are construed as xenophobia is really about policies stemming from ftas like ceca.
18574,"Thats fucked, I used think to myself whats the harm done but when i interact with open minded white people i realise I am guilty of implicit racism"
18575,Some poorer families NEED the maid because they cant work otherwise.
18576,A maid is cheaper than childcare or eldercare.
18577,"If they dont have a maid, they cant work, and their economic situation gets poorer."
18578,"They can afford to pay the maids salary but the shn/quarantine/test fees can be a significant upfront cost, and in recent times with alot of maid hopping this cna be incredibly draining on lower income families."
18579,Thats not racist.
18580,I'm unfortunate that I met the really racist people but I 100% believe you that you were with the bunch who weren't.
18581,"Thats white privilege for you, aka positive racism."
18582,Whats bothering me is that your relative who runs a maid agency did not even know that MOM had actually banned her from working in Singapore.
18583,"Considering you most likely can have 1-5 VPs in every company, 300-500 means 60-400+ companies have their senior management taken up by CECA, this is not to mention the other FTAs which allow expats to come in."
18584,That’s a lot of loops to go through to defend racism.
18585,"That’s a very flawed standard of multiculturalism, but I would say you do have an inkling of a point  Not only is our Chinese pop higher than their Malay pop, we also beat the differences out of our major racial groups (tho not so much Indians) to achieve more easily identifiable CMIO categories (like Chinese/Malay dialects), and tried to top-down dictate culture, Chinese in particular  What Malaysia is less of (just my 0.02) is peacefully integrated."
18586,"I, too, had a bad experience though it wasn’t a racist one."
18587,"But we weren’t really feeling impatient about the long wait cos we can see with our own eyes that all the other patients coming in and getting triaged above him were in much, much worse states, like migrant workers coming in with open and bleeding wounds, someone else suddenly coding at another bed in the A&E, etc."
18588,"And if they do, they have so many nieces and nephews to help that it’ll probably never get to ever be a stranger… but tbh I also have much wealthier friends and none of them AFAIK paid for their maids’ children’s education"
18589,"If all you had was polite discourse, you would not have Lawrence Wong or Shanmugam even acknowledging that racism exists."
18590,"If you want a similar example, look at what happened with the rapid rise of cases amongst migrant workers during Covid."
18591,Don’t treat racists with respect.
18592,We rely on modern day slaves and expats.
18593,"That’s because we succeeded in wiping out the actual mother tongues, which is the topic of this article!"
18594,That’s called Foundation mother tongue (primary school) or Syllabus B (secondary school).
18595,"Singapore needs MNCs and expats, and all of this nativism will be its downfall."
18596,"That’s for undocumented immigrants, not h1b workers."
18597,She did not show any change of stance or growth on her racist tweets.
18598,I thought my salary was low with long hours but $600 for maids with potential of 24/7 work without boundaries is modern day slavery.
18599,I’ve heard mental gymnastics like how maids cannot be treated too well if not they take advantage of the situation.
18600,"Her hair dye job looks like it costs more than the foreign worker’s daily wage, proper relatability."
18601,"I’ve heard from many people, voices like, “Those Filipino maids, they chose to come here”."
18602,But I think we are a small country and people are generally not xenophobic.
18603,People used to be okay with immigrants but we have come to a stage where the country is bursting at the beams and I know we can continue to build skyscrapers on the nature reserves and in fact we are also building underground city so as to take in more people but there is a physical limit as to how many people we can take.
18604,"So I see so many comments saying Singaporeans are xenophobic but just imagine you are from a tiny country and the greatest population density in the world, you would also think twice of importing more foreigners."
18605,Everything is racist now just like previously everything was sexual harassment.
18606,Racist-outrage people seeing racism everything when it’s not equivalent
18607,You wouldn’t do it but some people make their maids do it.
18608,"That’s the thing though, racism occurs everywhere, irregardless of nationality."
18609,That can be considered racism.
18610,"Everyone faces racism at some point of time, whether or not a minority or a majority."
18611,"That, in my books, is the definition of racism."
18612,"My country has limited supplies as well, but no difference was made between citizens and immigrants."
18613,"People I know who call domestic workers “maid” tend to think they have the right to dictate what they do, such as the emotions the domestic worker should show or whether they can eat at the same table."
18614,"These people shouldn’t have the right to employ domestic workers, IMO."
18615,"The first time I ever went to Australia, that time I experienced a bit of racism, it was really, really minor IMO."
18616,That’s what we call xenophobia whereas the person is biased about people not from their country.
18617,Perhaps it would be less racist but maybe more offensive if you list the offending behaviour - “no cultural history of making kimchi” or “no ghee related body odours”.
18618,That’s why racism and generalising people is just flawed and filled with loopholes and hypocrisy.
18619,"The maid had no off days and no handphone access so she can’t communicate with anyone outside, she made the maid sign a confession of stealing food so that the maid will be afraid of going to the police."
18620,"At that point, she prob feels that she has absolute control over the maid."
18621,Your post almost borders on racism by implying that locals have inferiority complex.
18622,It’s quite an irony that your post itself is kind of racist when you’re implying others are.
18623,"Anyway, the main issue is not about racism but more on local privilege and how the local wants the Government to protect them first."
18624,"In my humble opinion, that’s our choice and neither make us racists nor religionists and most certainly not sexist."
18625,"Cos, y'know, if I wanted to call you bro, I'd call you bro and not some potentially racist term."
18626,"The ""better"" primary schools do have higher mother tongue and gifted programs."
18627,"It has the same flavor as the opposite argument ""i personally didnt lose my job, so I think the status quo is just fine, no need for changing immigration policy or implementing a minimum wage, because my personal experience should speak for national policy""."
18628,"I also don't know where the hell the foreign talent thing is coming from, OP never mentioned it."
18629,Were we racist against China last year?
18630,You mean what our govt is doing now ain't racist?
18631,"I remembered earlier in May they tested 30,000+ workers in dorms and 20,000+ were positive — that means it some >60% infection rate among those tested (granted they likely tested workers in dorms where there was a high rate of infection first so the actual infection rate of the whole 323,000 migrant workers is likely to be much lower)   But let’s try to use the newer numbers we have here — looking at the math:  There are 323,000 foreign workers living in dorms -> ~10%  means that ~30,000 infected (for reference current Google tally says 32,876 people in total in Singapore have tested positive)   I can’t seem to find the numbers of workers tested already (it’s probably out there) but a May 13 report stated that they tested more than 32,000 workers and run at least 3000 tests a day (which they are looking to ramp up)  Realistically not all the tests are would be given to new unique workers — they would have to retest some of the workers to confirm or test those who have tested positive but seem recovered to clear them etc."
18632,"But even if we assume they test 3,000 unique new individuals daily, between May 13 to the day the article is written (27 May) they would have tested 42,000 additional workers   That would be 42,000+ 32,000 = 74,000 tested so far   ~30,000/74,000 = ~40% infection rate   Hopefully the actual infection rate is lower than this (if they have been prioritising higher risk dorms for testing)    But it’s hard to imagine the massive impact on the economy would be enormous if such a large % of our 323,000 migrant workers test positive."
18633,In the future SG might have difficulty attracting migrant workers.
18634,Why is a law mandating representation of minorities for the Presidency going to contribute to racism?
18635,The whole point of our immigration policy is to get economically productive people.
18636,"The AG has never hanged a foreign domestic worker since the case of Flor Ramos Contemplacion, as it damaged political relations between SG and Phillipines."
18637,The Australian PM dropped some heavy hints that they have a VTL with Japan launching soon.
18638,The CMIO model in Singapore is fucked.
18639,Because of the CMIO model.
18640,"But point is: there's a lot of nuance to the issue of race, culture, religion here in Singapore which the governmently conveniently simplifies by creating the CMIO model."
18641,"The Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) classification, in place since the first Census in 1824, has been put to use in housing and education policies and it's an outdated way of classifying people."
18642,"I feel Singaporeans can fill this hiring gap but then they choose to get expats from overseas, and many jobs are not posted on mycareersfuture."
18643,"The Entry Permit system we already have in place for non-VTL flights does exactly the same thing, except that we don't try to micromanage which flights are used by people flying in with Entry Permits."
18644,"The FCF was implemented only in 2016, 11 years after CECA."
18645,Some customers straight up refuse to talk to them while some give racist feedbacks.
18646,The Govt has just announced travel restrictions on travellers from Hubei  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-latest-confirmed-cases-coronavirus-12360924
18647,"The Govt has made it clear FDWs are not to have bfs or get married here and they make employers sign insurance and bonds in the event the FDWs get pregnant or get into an incident with the bfs, etc, employers are fined or not able to claim their insurance."
18648,">   >Besides, unlike China which had no considerable immigrant settlers, Malaysia has far too many non-Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays the moment protection is removed."
18649,The NGOs are not calling for a reduction in migrant worker reliance.
18650,The OP I was referring to said FDW.
18651,"The PAP government is deliberately vague about the details of its immigration policy although we know that the current government under Lee Hsien Loong prioritizes large-scale immigration (much higher than what was allowed under his predecessors) to support economic growth, often to the detriment of social cohesion, wage inequality and labor productivity."
18652,"The PAP has a shitty record when it comes to race issues, but I don't think it's crazy to say that the PAP is probably the most pro-immigrant party in Singapore."
18653,They want the immigrant dollars.
18654,"Some xenophobic assholes like to say that this is because they're brainwashed ill informed idiots, but I cannot disagree more."
18655,"The POSB Payroll Account is a zero balance account for maids:   [https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-permit-for-fdw/how-to-open-a-bank-account-for-my-foreign-domestic-worker](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-permit-for-fdw/how-to-open-a-bank-account-for-my-foreign-domestic-worker)   It also has an option to ""Remit salary back home at S$0 fee"":   [https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/accounts/direct-salary-crediting?cid=sg-posb-vanity-deposits-fdw#](https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/accounts/direct-salary-crediting?cid=sg-posb-vanity-deposits-fdw#)"
18656,So we should be asking ourselves why that is and examining the underlying racism that is driving this current furore.
18657,Not a JoTeo material but it's about migrant workers' issues on cheap but bad food.
18658,"The SCMP, over the years, has consistently downplayed the Hong Kong population's own gripes over mainlanders and expats taking up top jobs."
18659,By taking such a broad anti-immigrant stance they not only alienate immigrants but the family members and friends of immigrants who often are native Singaporeans.
18660,"What most Singaporeans probably fail to realize is that virtually every other country (China, India, US, Indonesia, etc) has a very restrictive immigration policy."
18661,"In fact, China does not even have one: it takes in no immigrants except for those who are married to Chinese nationals."
18662,"The SG strategy for migrant workers is that they are transient, replacable, and can be deported in a recession like now."
18663,"Imagine our surprise when we returned 5 minutes later to see an Indian lady, her maid and her stroller sitting at our table."
18664,"We could tell immediately that this lady was an expatriate from India due to her particular accent (we're Indian ourselves), so we genuinely thought she didn't understand the hawker etiquette here."
18665,"I don’t mean for this post to be racist or xenophobic in any way, I just needed somewhere to vent."
18666,Perhaps any foreigners or expats on this subreddit could weigh in here.
18667,"It's whether MOM sees one's application as being *over the quota* (for selected industries) or the company that one is applying for, has exceeded its local talent-to-foreign talent ratios."
18668,Given the recent protests against CECA which seem to be incredibly surprising to me given the rarity of public protests.
18669,Are we experiencing an anti-immigrant populist wave ?
18670,They see foreign workers as economic animal.
18671,The migrant worker crisis lowered the overall score on the report card from an A to an A-.
18672,"The Singaporean government still wants smart and rich expats, not Singaporean citizens."
18673,Only primary and secondary schools focused on Mandarin as a mother tongue offer the Special Assistance Plan.
18674,See the word only Mandarin as a mother tongue language?
18675,It may actually work to your disadvantage if racism is more pervasive here than the UK since it may waste more of your time with unneeded viewings.
18676,"Like others pointed out, please check out the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) requirements."
18677,"The VTL countries are just 7 days SHN at your own home, so not too bad"
18678,The VTL is for returning to Singapore not for leaving Singapore.
18679,So this decision should not impact the VTL
18680,"The VTL is probably more for Indian workers here so that they can go home and see their families, and facilitate the travel of new incoming Indian workers who really are the backbone of our construction industry."
18681,"Expats are leaving by the truckloads, and that includes Indians not just white expats."
18682,"The VTL was also my way of seeing the fiancé and it's so hard trying to plan a wedding (to go for wedding shows, seeing venues and PWS) when borders are closed."
18683,The VTL was my way to get back to my family at last.
18684,The VTLs are absolutely destroying Singapore airlines reputation as well.
18685,"I’ve now done VTL to UK and US, and at each airport the biggest queue to check in has been at SQ desks."
18686,The WhatsApp messages she posted explicitly mentioned that the landlords prefer Caucasian or Japanese expats.
18687,"How come suddenly the racism she claims is against ""non-Chinese""?"
18688,The [Straits Times article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/couple-sentenced-to-jail-for-abusing-maid-who-was-caned-and-forced-to-eat-own) on the same couple has additional info:  > She was also told that an assassin would be hired to kill her family members back home.
18689,"The [legal minimum monthly wage for a maid in the Philippines](http://www.gov.ph/2013/01/18/republic-act-no-10361/) is 1,500-2,500 pesos (S$44-S$74) - 2,500 in the Manila area and either 1,500 or 2,000 elsewhere."
18690,"Perhaps now you can see why so many maids are willing to be ""enslaved"" in Singapore, as you put it."
18691,"Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar) from which our foreign workers come."
18692,Singaporeans can and should be nicer to foreign workers.
18693,"Compared to the rich economies (notably the US, western Europe, and Japan) that completely close their doors to Filipino maids (in part so that they don't need to feel guilty about ""exploiting"" the poor), Singapore gives workers from poor countries a much better deal by offering them the option of being ""exploited""."
18694,"&#x200B;  Third,   By equating foreign workers = the needy (as per the quotation), isn't she just put herself in a higher pedestal."
18695,This manifestly condescending toward migrant workers.
18696,"Some of these migrant workers are actually have landed house, farmland and all in their home country - I kid you not."
18697,"It would be way more wholesome if she see the migrant workers as equal human beings, sharing as friends instead of ""the needy""."
18698,The act itself is not racist but the comments surrounding the decision by people is
18699,If you already have a VTL ticket you're fine.
18700,The actual first step is for everyone to acknowledge that racism has been a feature of Singapore society since the beginning of our formation and **for people to be aware of the privilege** and not dismiss concerns by minorities about racism (See brownface incident).
18701,"Then, and only then, can we have a grown up discussion about what to do about racism."
18702,"""Black people cannot be racist because they are the minority."""
18703,"While taking steps to make society less racist, let us take care not to polarize people, lest discussion becomes impossible."
18704,"The actual quote from JoTeo is:  >I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology  [Sauce](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/migrant-worker-no-apology-jo-teo/)  It requires them to meet peasants like us, and that does not happen, I guess?"
18705,But that does not make them racist.
18706,"So if an Indian lady only dates Caucasians because she is not attracted to Chinese men and didn't find them pleasing to her eye, she's not racist."
18707,"So, if a dating app includes a race filter, would that be racist?"
18708,The amount of casual racism here is... Not surprising.
18709,"We can raise hell about improving our HCWs' working culture but god forbid that we talk more about our 3rd world maid culture (in this thread, examplified by a HCW)."
18710,"It is a move that can be criticized, discussed as it should be when the population considered as 'immigrants' is considerable, more than in other places."
18711,What about the expats who mingle with other expats after work?
18712,Its not preference it’s racism.
18713,The answer is four letters: CMIO.
18714,I lived more than half a decade overseas as a minority and have experienced both overt and casual racism.
18715,"](https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f213ne/_/fha3y17/?context=1)  Are we really so fragile and ignorant that you would automatically dismiss any criticism towards an ethnic group as being racist, despite the face that a prominent member of their own race shares a similar sentiment?"
18716,"I realised I did not have people who could understand and support me, when I faced racism at workplace."
18717,The government charges insane amounts of levies for the employment of foreign workers.
18718,But the latter is truly a despicable form of racism that should be stomped out.
18719,My auntie's maid asked for a pay advance because her daughter was getting married and needed some cash for the wedding.
18720,":/ Unfortunately, a lot of maids send every penny home only to get squandered away by lazy relatives and have no money of their own after working for years."
18721,"The article itself says that those expat packages are long gone - they aren't gone this year, they've been gone for many years."
18722,So it is less the words used and more the attitude towards the treatment of the racists.
18723,Where people are instantly demonizing them instead of helping them understand the need to be less racist and more understanding of each other.
18724,"Which, ironically is also what those who self-proclaimed are anti-racist need to do too..."
18725,The article talks about the government's stance on maids leaving the house.
18726,The article title ask people stop blaming in this crises then proceed to blame shift it to migrant workers?
18727,The assumption that low income foreign workers only take loans because their family back home is in desperate need of money is completely wrong.
18728,"Now, this xenophobic nutter."
18729,"The average salary for an FDW is 500 to 600, the average salary for a cleaner is 1400, which has to cover housing plus food."
18730,Indo maids?
18731,"*Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL, from 8 Sep): Germany, Brunei*  PCR test before departure (\~€50-70 for Germany, express options available), PCR test on arrival (S$160), PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 (S$125 each)."
18732,"*Category 2: Australia, Canada, Jiangsu (also Germany and Brunei, if you choose non-VTL flights)*  PCR test on arrival (S$160), PCR test on Day 7 (S$125)."
18733,"You can visit a combination of Cat 1, 2, 3, and VTL countries in the previous 21 days."
18734,"Note that cases in Switzerland are on the rise, which might prompt changes in travel restrictions."
18735,"The best case scenario, then, is that her followers are people who don't ""identify with"" being Islamophobic/racist/xenophobic/etc., but are simply willing to excuse such behaviour as long as someone is also pretty/has a good sense of humour/gives honest reviews/etc."
18736,"If your stance is ""I'm not racist, but I'm willing to support people who are"" - how clear is the line between ""mundane motivations"" and ""bad intentions""?"
18737,The best course of action should you see this form of racist abusive harassment is to not engage the abuser.
18738,Engage with the victim and make them feel that nobody shares the racist's sentiments.
18739,The best way to deal with this is to simply ban live in maids
18740,"If you want to go anything engineering or IT, maths and physics are important, you can forgo mother tongue."
18741,"Born in the 80s, I was conned by my parents, government and schools into thinking that Mandarin was really my mother tongue and that dialects were ""dirty""."
18742,Then the VTL enforcement?
18743,The bike forum is actually less racist than FB and Edmw.
18744,The blatant casual racism and ablism is EVERYWHERE it is fucking disgusting.
18745,She gets bullied by our racist boss and colleagues even after telling them off multiple times.
18746,"Racist insults and prejudice aside, during her appraisal she was rated horribly, had to sit through a meeting with HR with racist boss hurling insults and about her alleged incompetance with the emotional abuse bombardment."
18747,"For comparison, another staff of the exact paygrade can slack off just because of her race and all her mistakes and inability to deliver work were overlooked and the racist boss freaking protects her."
18748,"So yes, even though I am Chinese, I whole-heartly agree on the many are racist snakes part."
18749,The border with China was open long before the other VTLs were open.
18750,"The brownface saga was ignorant marketing as well, and that screams racism."
18751,Why shouldn't I consider this as racism?
18752,"Personally, I don't think it is racist, definitely stupid and ignorant."
18753,"The challenge, as I’m sure you’re aware, is that expats are strangled away from their families whereas locals can (obviously) see theirs."
18754,"The CDC in the US gives the UK a level 4 ranking, but here its category II with VTL."
18755,I say all of this as an expat who has been on the receiving end of explicit and blatant racism both here in Singapore and elsewhere too.
18756,I’ve not seen anybody raised any issue about brigading re: racism posts here.
18757,The classes are all reserved for the xenophobic isolationist people who don't even understand their own posts.
18758,"The classic expat package is usually negotiated so that it would cover the expenses (rent, international schools, air tickets home, etc) of the expat's family."
18759,"Lots of ""siao lang"" and ""lock her up"" comments mixed with the usual racist/ xenophobic crap."
18760,"In term of racism, it's not very prevalent here."
18761,"People tend to complain about the racism here but as compared to other countries, it's not really much."
18762,The additional cost is $7-15 per year which I think it's fair enough to ensure that the domestic workers do get some sort of compensation if they do get seriously injured : https://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes/posts/10154391572317115
18763,"The common assumption is that jobs are static and that if foreign workers leave, Singaporean workers have to step in."
18764,"The companies can come, but not the cheap expats"
18765,The companies choose not to do better because our country doesn't have a great track record when it comes to lowly paid foreign foreign workers.
18766,The company should boot/replace the hiring manager that directed the requirements for racist hiring methods and the poor HR admin a warning for not being attentive to such racist requirements when they submit...
18767,"If you want to be racist, at least be accurate."
18768,"Getting a cheap maid to do the house chores etc is akin to getting bargain, and the locals sure love their bargains, such as constantly asking for ""free gifts"" with their purchases since they paid full price for it instead of getting a steep discount."
18769,"The concept of racial “harmony” in Singapore protects the racists, not the victims."
18770,"To protect the “harmony”, the minorities are pressured from a very young age not to stir the pot, or worst, to take racist acts on the chin and live with it."
18771,"She claims her class was racist yet she posted a picture of her with friend from the 3 main races of Singapore, and she was stupid enough to use the following caption for the photo: ""The only dark skinned girl in the room"" when there is another Indian girl in the photo."
18772,"Your example only applies to 1 person, not a entire demographic, which is what racism is."
18773,"By your explanation, it shows you have never been under the prolonged influence of racism and hurtful things being said to you from a very young age."
18774,"I'm not sure where you are reading into all this ""I accuse the PA of being racist""."
18775,The cultural arguments (indians are this and that) are just racist comments under veil because it is prejudging the whole race based on a few.
18776,"These cultural comments that Indians are this & that are just trying to be scientific and statistically right instead of being racist based on biological traits..If you apply the same lens to others then you will see that these traits are uniform everywhere   All these racist veiled as culturalists, confuse local supremacy doesn't mean objective supremacy."
18777,"But when I think about it from my own perspective, it seem to hit hard that being an expat in another country is the worst possible outcome of the situation."
18778,It’s a pretty shorty predicament to be in and will make people think about their life choices and whether it’s even worth being an expat.
18779,Couldn't the current facts point to racism **OR** sexism?
18780,Why do people and you still jumped to the racism conclusion?
18781,Is it because racism is the trending topic so that's at the top of everyone's mind or that conclusion fits their racism narrative?
18782,">It's time for the people to understand, that at some point we were all immigrants too."
18783,A bunch of immigrants complaining about immigrants... lol  edit: grammared
18784,"If you choose to look at limiting our outsourcing to Nepal as ""racism"", then I guess I don't really know how to argue that."
18785,"Diana Ser gave MoM chances to give a strong reassurance and commitment to the public and foreign workers to improve conditions but the response that came back was mild at best, and imo, totally lacking the compassion and drive for change."
18786,The design of the banner won’t matter at all to the sickening racists featured in this post.
18787,One thing you seldom see is maids going out to cycle or jog.
18788,Call the prospective tenants racist?
18789,There are downright incorrigible landlords who are blatantly racist or discriminatory.
18790,There’s lots of maid abuse cases that have a very common theme which is that their phones are taken away from them.
18791,A maid cannot say fuck you and quit... because of the implications.
18792,Hopefully the next maid get tortured less after this ordeal.
18793,"The difference is that if they experience ""full blown racism"" of the non-physical kind, they tend to get called out by the people around them."
18794,"People used to look out for this they associate with prc Chinese like accent, names, and so on, before being xenophobic assholes."
18795,For Indians it's basically brown skin = CECA.
18796,And this overlaps predictably with whatever latent racism we already have against our minority groups - for Indians that would be all the apunehneh nonsense that's been going around for generations.
18797,"Rental market can continue exist in the private market (since there is no restriction on how many private properties you can own), and it can give rise to regulated residences to either be managed by existing hotel chains or management companies to handle the general foreigner/expat rental market."
18798,"How many others, for example workers from dormitories and other maids have suffered similar injustice and were steamrolled?"
18799,The domestic helper has been in Singapore for 16 years under the same employer and she had to quit to marry the dude.
18800,The domestic worker will be bankrupt first if she tried to sue.
18801,"The dormitory management never thought of that, their more concern with following the guidelines set forth by the government, sans the well being of their tenants."
18802,The dormitory my company’s workers are residing at got locked down today.
18803,"The downvotes clearly reflect the ignorance towards this kind of racism in the job world, or that people dont read properly."
18804,"The dumb thing is if they allege that victim was too quick and unfair to call them racists, them proudly parading their ""Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) and the Indian Activity Executive Committees Council (Narpani Pearavai)"" as evidence that they're not racist is just one dumbass response."
18805,"It's like the excuse ""I got one black friend hence I cannot be racist""."
18806,Ultimately racism is a subjective opinion that's up for public debate.
18807,"Right thing to do was to admit they've screwed up, much to learn, say that this was an honest mistake with no racist intentions, use this crisis as learning opportunity yadda-yadda PR doublespeak, and will engage victim actively to understand her position and how the organization can make amends."
18808,"Since English is widely studied as a foreign language in Europe and Singapore has the loosest immigration policy in the English-speaking world, moving to Singapore is the only way for them to leave Europe."
18809,Australia is also no longer as welcoming of immigrants because the commodities-fuelled boom is over.
18810,But that does not mean that Singapore cannot expect immigrants to be able to speak its working language.
18811,The elephant in the room is that there will be racist people.
18812,Just that the majority of the population is Chinese so statistically the probability of finding a racist Chinese is higher than finding a racist non-Chinese.
18813,"Also, there is a difference between being racist and being biased."
18814,"If the boss is harsher towards you but more lenient towards another employee who just so happens to share his race, this might not mean that he is racist."
18815,"Only if you can prove that he is harsher towards everybody of a different race and more lenient towards every one of the same race, can you call him a racist."
18816,"If you can provide more proof of your boss being a racist, I'm sure we will gladly help you."
18817,"Lastly, don't anything also accuse racism."
18818,"If you anything also accuse racism, it dilutes the severity of the statement, and make people not take actual racism seriously."
18819,"Once again though, if your boss is really being a racist, do provide us with more information."
18820,The employer borrowed $3k from the maid?
18821,The employer can send maid back to home country no if or buts
18822,"The employer has a legal obligation to ensure that the maid in their employ does not get pregnant, or otherwise run afoul of the law."
18823,Those maids that get pregnant while on duty have breached the terms of employment.
18824,"Source: http://singaporemaidagency.com/What-Happens-If-My-Singapore-Maid-Gets-Pregnant-While-Under-My-Employment.php  However, what employers may not know is that their security deposit will not be forfeited in the event it happens."
18825,"> MOM understands employers' concerns that they should not be held responsible when their FDWs violate the Work Permit conditions on their own accord, especially outside designated work hours or on their rest days."
18826,"Therefore, since January 2010, MOM has removed employers’ liability if the FDW gets pregnant or breaches other Work Permit conditions that relate to her own behaviour."
18827,Source: https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-replies/2011/5000-security-bond-not-forfeited-if-maids-get-pr
18828,The employer isn't even willing to lend the maid 150?
18829,The employer should be severely punished that cause the maid the climb down 15 stories.
18830,The maid should enlist in SAF Commando as she is already so proficient!
18831,"The employer-maid system here should be regulated by a basic contract applicable for all sg maids, in terms of stipulated hours of work not more than a certain number, and rights that maids have."
18832,Perhaps a union of maids and maid agencies to fight for their terms.
18833,Free market in this case is to the disadvantage of the maids.
18834,Must they become like great buddies with the maids?
18835,Are you assuming that people are abusing their maids just from the way they act in public?
18836,"You might not know, but maids nowadays are picky about employers too."
18837,The entire management must admit they are racist and quit their job and sarah b be hailed as a hero and written into social studies textbooks as Singapore's Rosa Parks
18838,"When the Parti Liyani case came up, my colleagues talked about it and we have no doubts the maid is innocent."
18839,"The exact same thing happens to me because of the way I look and my coloured eyes and the fact that I'm an atheist, but I'm a Bangla do the remarks I hear are top tier racism."
18840,It is actual institutional racism.
18841,"If it happens, they will be GLAD they didnt work under a racist boss, and if theyre that good they will be able to find another job elsewhere."
18842,"The expat we need, but don't deserve"
18843,"The expats love what Kampong Glam is now, but us locals hate it because it's meant to be a cultural enclave but is now gentrified."
18844,The expensive to live thing usually references an index for “expatriate living”.
18845,"You have no idea of the ground conditions in FDWs - that’s a fact  You ass-ume I don’t know - now that’s your myopic, limited & narrow view which you are entitled to."
18846,The viral load cultivated from the mucus extracted via the nostrils of each & every FWs residing in FDW by digging deep with long cotton bud swap bears the evidence how the immune system of FWs is battling the SCV2.
18847,The fact of the matter is the 3 mother tongue languages are falling out of favour within the younger households; families are switching to English or using a mashed version of it at home.
18848,So the focus should indeed be on learning mother tongue first.
18849,"The fact that people can only fly is not only stupid, but the proof that the whine VTL is just a ponzi scheme to leech money back into the airlines pockets."
18850,Alternative strategies/measures (as to how the migrant workers are housed/treated) could have been raised and discussed.
18851,"The family should be jailed, not a maid whose job description isn't the same as a nurse."
18852,The family should be paying the maid triple her normal salary for all the years she lost thanks to this case they fabricated against her.
18853,The family so rich but so miserly to hire another maid to clean his toilet.
18854,The fear of being subjected to racism abroad is often based in xenophobia.
18855,The figure I've heard is it costs about $10k for expats to give birth here when you add up all the costs.
18856,"The figures might show that CECA does not impact our immigration policy, but the fact is that our immigration policy is indeed flawed and has allowed too many India professionals to enter our country for so many years, and these people are the main foreigners who practice discriminatory hiring."
18857,I applaud the PSP for bringing up this CECA debate in parliament.
18858,"The fines were levied on the agencies, not the maids."
18859,"And I believe the maids still got their pay increment, since the agencies were not prohibited from raising their pay."
18860,"In addition, anti-cartel actions like this are also good for the maids themselves, since price fixing will also artificially depress their wages."
18861,The first point is true for all expats and I feel for them.
18862,The first point on the domestic worker going to office to clean is enough to bring criminal charges upon this former MP.
18863,Get video evidence of the FDW cleaning in the office and send it up to MOM or just sell it to ST or mothership.
18864,The first thing you do is to scream fuck you to everyone who upvotes this as a racist apologist garbage.
18865,"That is not a hard and fast rule, though, and I have seen a few instances where for exceptional candidates the company has applied for the employment pass."
18866,The first wave of migrant workers came to build Singapore's infrastructures.
18867,A large percentage of migrant workers still do manual labor so I think that's why they became the representative stereotype.
18868,This shit about rankings needs to stop before we address anything else about foreign worker employment.
18869,The foreign worker has rented one bed and maybe one locker.
18870,"But if a foreign worker complains about a broken toilet, and the dorm operator does nothing, do you think the workers know who to report to, how to file small claims tribunal?"
18871,"If a foreign worker gets moved into a room infested with cockroaches, he can try to keep his own bed area clean, and to convince his roommates to do the same, but if some of the roommates don't cooperate, what can he do?"
18872,Because the work permit holders have no choice in where they live.
18873,Employers cheap out and dorm operators cheap out (win-win for them both) and the foreign worker just has to suck it up.
18874,The foreign worker levy is suppose to equal the playing field.
18875,The foreign workers are people who have contributed greatly to Singapore too.
18876,"The foreign workers are really suffering during covid19 outbreak but with the large scale testings on all dorms, this will certainly help them to recover ASAP."
18877,"The foreign workers take up our healthcare resources as well, so CB will definitely be extended."
18878,Also somehow the anger is directed towards the foreign workers itself when it's not like they sneaked into the country.. they're on government issued employment passes.
18879,* I am a foreign worker.
18880,VTLs is to gatekeep imported cases when community transmission is low   Still have VTL now for what?
18881,"If you substitute CECA with some other foreign agreement like with PRC, Mexico or Russia, you'll see a lot of the same resentment because they are angry about being treated like low class citizens."
18882,The funny thing is that the people calling out racist or offensive content tend to not be from the demographic supposed to be affected by them as well.
18883,"The gist of the arguments put forth by supporters was that Ms Khan was merely addressing the ""systemic"" racism and discrimination against the minorities."
18884,The good immigrant(or expat) it's a concept that last just until the next opinion shift.
18885,"On the other hand though, what we can do is to make it extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient to be racist/make racist remarks for the people closest to us."
18886,"Why can't it impose more stringent ones to ensure that our foreign workers, which our country heavily depends on, are treated decently?"
18887,The government collect a levy on each of the foreign workers.
18888,The government collects hundreds in monthly levies for each migrant worker employed.
18889,Most of us don't care about migrant worker rights so the government uses our indifference as cover.
18890,"Admittedly some expenditures cannot be given out as money (or example virus testing, increasing healthcare capacity, relocating migrant workers and enforcing safe-distancing measures), but how many per cent of the budget are these?"
18891,You are *just not hungry enough* and now you are even being racist and prejudiced!
18892,I don't understand why people are saying the migrant workers are picky.
18893,"On hindsight, the government could have chosen to continue circuit breaker and not open up all those VTLs until everyone (including kids) gets their second jab."
18894,"The government should indeed step up, but one can hope that if the sentiment from the general population towards migrant workers becomes more favourable, employers would also be included among said general population and more of them would feel a moral obligation to treat their migrant worker employees less exploitatively."
18895,"You and the PAP can keep saying ""CECA does not alter immigration requirements."""
18896,"The government, barely covered the locals, then having extra resources to even cover the expats."
18897,The great thing about Singapore is not that we deny racism exists.
18898,"We should take a leaf from our forefathers ,embrace the differences rather than talk about racism in the form of trying to eradicate it."
18899,"Hes saying end VTLs and let anyone travel to singapore freely, whether they are vaxxed or not."
18900,The guy in Dave's story is much better than lots of folks in this sub :) At least the guy has the self awareness to admit he is racist.
18901,This sub on the other hand has a significant population of closeted racists who thinks they are simply brave to be politically incorrect.
18902,The hawkers in the early days were immigrants trying to make a living in Singapore as well.
18903,The high fees that expats pay in the International Schools a major portion of that is what the SG Govt uses for providing subsidies in the local schools.
18904,"The higher social class racists are the ones to watch for, not the bbfa type who ramble on Facebook."
18905,That's like saying you are a racist just because your gf isn't indian or you are just not that attracted to ppl outside your race (which is statistically true for all races).
18906,The husband has to serve 43 months (three years and seven months) for the abuse of their first maid.
18907,The two-year sentence is for abusing his second maid.
18908,You and i both know that racism exists.
18909,"But sometimes, racism is so deeply ingrained and learned that it's present even when we aren't fully aware of it."
18910,This is why the actress cited examples from her daily life that may very well occur in everyone else's and we may not even realise that it's racist.
18911,The idea of an expat package has been disappearing for at least 5 years now.
18912,"If you see any ang moh under 35 here, they're almost certainly not on an expat package."
18913,Companies are providing expat packages less than they used to.
18914,"More ang moh are coming to Singapore at lower levels in companies, and willing to work without being on an expat package."
18915,"The expat package change is that companies are increasingly reluctant to use foreign managers (anywhere, not just in Singapore) if they can help it, as foreign managers are sometimes more expensive."
18916,You will nowadays only get the high end expat package if you are a regional CEO or someone of a similar world class caliber.
18917,Anyone below that level no longer qualifies for special expat treatment.
18918,"Current VTLs are KL and JB only, so let's start with flights to Penang, Kota Kinabalu, etc."
18919,"\- An open immigration policy so they can go around the world and get cheap, middle-class jobs rather than expensive sinkies."
18920,~50% of our migrant workers in dorms have such immunity.
18921,The implementation is basically the same as the air VTL; just with buses haha.
18922,Only takes the word expat to trigger them
18923,The inconsiderate truth is that most Singaporean Chinese are racist.
18924,But some of them are racist without even knowing they are.
18925,The increasing old age dependency ratio coupled with decreasing fertility rate and failure to meet the immigrant quota.
18926,"The insistence of Chinese race people in Singapore, very similar to white people in the west, that they get to decide what is acceptable racism and what's ""just fun"" - it's just mind-boggling."
18927,Robert Downey Jr. famously did a blackface role in Tropic Thunder but it wasn’t seen as racist was it?
18928,Intent is not part of any of the definitions of racism that people are bringing up.
18929,"So if there is a redefinition of the term ""racism"" then my question is that are people redefining the term to incorporate the requirement of intention."
18930,>But when you’re brushing actual hateful racists that think Malays are subhumans with those who are ignorant and are willing to learn and be better  But surely we all recognize that people can be varying degrees of racist.
18931,Not all racists are immediately Hitler.
18932,As such the term racist does not immediately mean that all racists are equally racist.
18933,"In any event, as far as I have read, Sarah does not even actually call the PA racist."
18934,Rather her contention (as phrase by the PA itself) is that the incident was racist.
18935,"As for expats, I said above, I would not have to match anything as it would just be priced into the total compensation package we would negotiate for."
18936,"You compete on salary, but MNC have no incentive to raise the salaries of expats beyond what they are paid abroad."
18937,"While I may lack the socio-political implications of immigration policy, I can see the economy behind as I do run hiring budget regularly."
18938,"The irony is all the people at arms against the rap music video calling it racist are the same people who old all those offended by the ad to ""chill"" and that it's just art/a joke."
18939,The irony is that Japanese expats look down on Singaporeans.
18940,The irony is that from an outsiders perspective it seems a significant portion of the population doesn't like Indian immigrants working in professional services as they take their caste prejudices with them and are treating locals (I'm guessing tamils) here with the respect they deserve.
18941,The irony is that the government itself is racist and discriminatory (*cough*Malays in NS*cough*)
18942,"The irony with your statement is that by calling this a race problem, you're showing yourself as the true racist by insinuating that everyone of that particular race in Singapore only lives in the dorms."
18943,Don't make it one by being a racist.
18944,The issue for a foreigner in Singapore really isn't with racism.
18945,People holding shares in REITS are going to lose value once office space demand shrinks since less expats work here.
18946,People selling goods and services to expats are going to lose their jobs too.
18947,Having a domestic helper is really a headache if agency dies not disclose or do not do their due diligence.
18948,The issue here isn't the racism.
18949,"The issue is not what CECA says, it is what Singaporeans see when they travel to work and turn up at their work location."
18950,The man in street who has more important things to do than read up on CECA.
18951,"(1) would require drastic rises in tax rates, so the couples with children are awarded extra rooms in HDBs, fully paid domestic helpers, subsidized surrogacy, and compensation in line with the cost of prospective career promotions (on the order of millions for many middle-class jobs)."
18952,"No matter how much training you throw at these ppl, I don't think they are able to compete with the young, furiously desperate and extremely obedient foreign workers (many which have decent education also)."
18953,Betrays your mindset of considering maids to be personal property or someone to be treated like a child.
18954,"See below, each of these cases carry higher penalties than the maid case."
18955,"Elsewhere in this thread there's someone stating his colleagues ""invent"" work for their maid just to get value for money (I think he said they make them hand wash clothes when a perfectly good washing machine is there)."
18956,"There's another link to letters where people complain about the one day they're forced to ""give"" their maid."
18957,I don't much care about any moral argument of having a maid - some people need help with chores and if hiring a maid is the right choice for them then that is none of my business.
18958,However those maids ought to still be treated with dignity and respect (like any other employee) and their rights as humans are no less important than your or my rights as a human.
18959,"Personally I have no need for a maid and no desire to have someone I don't know live with me, but if those circumstances change then I would only hire a maid if I could provide them with a reasonable working environment."
18960,We've been too kind to these maid torturers by calling them abusers.
18961,What she did to her maid was nothing short of sadistic torture.
18962,"If Yukatas and Kimonos are specific to different occasions, and you misrepresent one for the other for the public to see, what's not racist about it?"
18963,That it's ignorant does not remove the potential for it being racist.
18964,The lady basically accused the staff of being racist.
18965,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o8ub5w/malay_woman_says_primadeli_staff_racist_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
18966,You are the definition of a racist.
18967,It is not a SJW thing to call you a racist.
18968,There is literally no skirting around the fact that you are a book-definition stone-cold racist for dismissing the safety-related concerns of a Singaporean family in the aftermath of a racially aggravated assault *against a Singaporean.
18969,The landlords are racist because they have a racial preference.
18970,"This kind of discrimination should be a criminal offense, but instead landlords feel free to openly state their racism"
18971,"If the country had a way to actually require this (in other places, a language test is often done, and I think having Indian immigrants speak Mandarin and Chinese immigrants speak Malay would be tough but cool), it would be fair."
18972,But as long as every local Joe and Jane can make up their own requirement - how can an immigrant actually demonstrate this?
18973,"But say you offer to share your food with your Malay classmates during his/her fasting period during Ramadan without knowing about Ramadan, this is just insensitive and ignorant, not racism."
18974,"Of course if you knew about Ramadan but purposely invite your Malay friend to a feast and let him/her smell and see all the good foods while mocking him/her about it, then that is clear racism."
18975,The law is French and it translates to 'racism' (racisme in French).
18976,"It covers all expressions, behaviour and insults related to racism."
18977,You can check http://egalitecontreracisme.fr/ce-que-dit-la-loi (use Google translate) for the exact wording in French law.
18978,I don't see the comparison of the decision to hire foreign workers to intentionally exploiting workers against the rights they are due.
18979,The law was meant to prevent employers from renting out their maids - this happened in the past.
18980,But we should move to no more live-in maids.
18981,"The laws regarding maids, domestic workers always feel 1 sided as in protection towards the workers."
18982,"The lengths that non Singaporean writer will go to, to deny racism."
18983,Just ask the average minority Singaporean about their views of racism and it invalidates everything he says.
18984,The line is put there to justify govt opening the door again to allow more migrant workers.

18994,"That asshole is not an ""expat"" and that incident has nothing to do with CECA."
18995,"If people have an problem with people like him, then they should be arguing for banning naturalisation through marriage, not CECA or expats."
18996,This is indeed prohibited under CECA.
18997,"CECA's impact on our immigration policy is clearly extremely limited, which is why sensible opposition parties like WP focuses directly on our immigration policy itself (which has serious problems with opaqueness and possible racism) and not FTAs like CECA."
18998,I seriously question what the fuck you are working on here and how exactly you're supposed to be a value adding expat to singapore's economy with this level of abysmal reasoning and comprehension
18999,The local Chinese are also racist to mainland Chinese.
19000,"&#x200B;  I too had conversations with colleagues who switched to burmese maids since their cheaper, and most likely they can push them around more so then indonesians and filipino's, and yet they lament why their maids have terrible language skills.."
19001,"The thing is that the maid knew about it too as her employer said he reminded her, so why she did what she did will probably remain a mystery."
19002,The low-skilled part of our foreign workers are \*transient\* workers.
19003,"These foreign workers are not allowed to bring dependents, get pregnant, settle in Singapore, etc."
19004,The maid did not work for that employer during that period though.
19005,The maid gets paid more than me 😭
19006,The maid has no legal costs.
19007,The maid is very daring.
19008,The maid needs to leave.
19009,"(she is indeed rude)  and you need to learn how to prepare and cook for your own, gawd this is embarrassing that you a 20-year-old is digressing about your maid online."
19010,"The maid scared to complaint, don't **even** know who to call."
19011,The maid should obviously not take out her frustration on a baby.
19012,The maid was wrong to abuse the woman but can see why...  > had to care for the victim on top of doing the housework in the six-person household.
19013,The maid's claims about the children's abuses at the instructions of their parents should be seriously looked into.
19014,"Apart from this case, if there's any truth in them, then the parents should be banned from ever employing another domestic helper to prevent another case of a maid being tortured to death."
19015,The maid/her family probably did not even get a chance to be represented in court.
19016,The maids need some sort of organization to protect them.
19017,There is also an economic case too in that WFH and homeschooling is pretty much impossible for parents without home help/maid (~ 83% of households).
19018,"From 11 November 2021, 2359 hours, we will also recognise a negative professionally administered2 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result as a valid PDT for all travellers arriving in or transiting through Singapore from Category II/III countries/ regions (including travellers via the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL))3 ."
19019,"The main difference between FDWs (or indeed other foreign labour in Singapore) and slaves is that FDWs are legally free to call up their agencies, quit, and return to their homelands."
19020,"Obviously in practice FDWs can't easily just resign and go home, because their families back home rely on the money they remit back (and they earn much more here than back home), but is this really that different from other people stuck in dead-end back-breaking jobs they hate but can't quit because they need the money to support a family?"
19021,"But it's way easier and more convenient for people, especially the xenophobic, to blame Viets in KTVs and Indians transiting in Changi."
19022,The main point the Singaporean government wants to play is that they *do not* want Bangla people to stop coming here and so obviously showcasing the negative aspects of being a foreign worker will dissuade a few people from coming here.
19023,The main reason I want to pursue a part time degree is to match up with foreign talents and gain work experience at the same time.
19024,Most of the Singaporean complain about fighting jobs with foreign talents.
19025,"I think by pursuing a part time degree, I can save some time to catch up with the foreign talents."
19026,I don't agree with the idea that maids have so little free time.
19027,I personally do agree that maids should get 1 day off for personal activities.
19028,My family does it by hiring a second maid solely for that day to work as well as help out with the general laundry.
19029,The majority of racists aren’t even intentional.
19030,Ignorance plays a huge part of racism.
19031,"The moment they become racist, is when they assume one for the other."
19032,"But to assume and not bother to learn the difference, that’s where racism starts."
19033,&nbsp;    What I’ve noticed with some racists is that they themselves experienced racism first hand by a particular group of people.
19034,A child is never racist until someone teaches them to or when they’ve experienced it themselves.
19035,"If they hire a maid, they gave to pay the fees associated with it ($2000)."
19036,If you hire a maid the least you can do is treat her like a human being.
19037,If he's the sole bread winner then he should have been more cautious about his racism whilst at work.
19038,The mandalorians were the ultimate racists btw
19039,You have to view a race as inferior to be racist.
19040,Stop undermining racism by calling everything racism.
19041,She was charging an interest of 180% per annum (APR) and worse still at disbursement she took out 15% and handing over only 85% of the loan to these poor maids.
19042,"If an expat has a family here and he or she is the sole breadwinner, then it isn't farfetched for them to say that $7K is required to lead a fairly comfortable life, considering that housing, healthcare and education is very expensive here without subsidies."
19043,The migrant workers are inside the dorm now right?
19044,The govt are helping the migrant workers just as they have said.
19045,The migrant workers in dorms should have been the very first group in Singapore to be fully vaccinated.
19046,The migration policy in Singapore is racist and gives advantages to rich Chinese .
19047,Borrowing money from legal moneylenders should not be allowed for foreign workers.
19048,Most jiak kantang households already have students struggling with mother tongue.
19049,(VTL being one of them: just ask people to test before departure and call it as day)
19050,"Perhaps a strong word to use but I hate it that as a Singaporean, I'm forced to tolerate your antics or unruly behaviour & if I don't, I'm the racist/xenophobic one."
19051,"The most disturbing thing is if these people have their beliefs challenged, they're not gonna think, "" oh my beliefs are racist?"
19052,"I should self reflect and change them"" they're gonna think, "" my beliefs are racist?"
19053,"Well, I guess im a racist now""."
19054,"Throughout the whole time, they kept pulling at my hair, calling me racist names and jeering me; all quietly."
19055,"I just felt pissed that in a place dedicated to racism and the Nazis attacking them, you would think they learnt not to do the same to others; just ironic."
19056,And of course my parents just brushed the incident off as a small matter; obviously since they weren’t the ones subjected to racist taunts and snarky comments.
19057,Also then Korea VTL brought more joy to me.
19058,The myth that only white people are racist needs to die.
19059,"The fact is, everyone is racist and tribalist at a subconscious level."
19060,"Some people know it's wrong to act on these impulses but the reality is that racism is endemic to the human heart just like all other evils such as lying, selfishness, lust and murder."
19061,A Chinese elderly that wants another Chinese person to coexist with because she's brought up with mainly Chinese people since 1950 is not racist.
19062,An Indian person who wants only Indians to live with because he is sure that on certain occasions when he decides to cook up his favourite Indian cuisine his rentee will most likely enjoy it as compared to other races is not racist.
19063,A Malay person who wants only Malays as their rentee because they have the same religion views is not racist or religion-sist.
19064,Unqualified excuse for losing and a perpetuated xenophobia.
19065,"My family might not be worried if I show them how low the crime rate is and how there’s little racism, they’re probably just going to want me to check in with them constantly and come visit during the holidays."
19066,"The nuance is that sometimes the racism experienced by minorities would be ""invisible"" to the Chinese majority and its easy to brush it off."
19067,"As a Chinese dude, I try not to be dismissive whenever my minority friends talk about racism I've never experienced."
19068,The number will correspond to expat population that was prevented from seeing their families for close to two years
19069,"Just for the past 2 days the numbers are above 1k, and Prof Mak already pre-prompt at the number will increase to 2-3k per day as extensive tests are conducted for our foreign worker friends from the dormitory."
19070,The one accusing others of racism is the one asking a China driver to speak english.
19071,"The one that ambushed a couple on the road and said it's racist that the South Asian (I refuse to say Indian for reasons,  separate story) boyfriend is preying on a Chinese girl instead of getting with someone his own race."
19072,But he has nothing against brown people and he is not racist so all good
19073,An expat that wants to work in this part of the world have relatively few options if they want a better standard of living.
19074,There’s a reason why you don’t see tons of expats all uprooting and leaving for Jakarta or HCMC because there are limitations there.
19075,The ones who said “bordering on racism” was drawing their own domestic experiences and from their local news.
19076,"In Australia, Europe and America, there was an increased in overt racism against Asians in general as if people are using this as a legitimate excuse to be racist."
19077,The same classmates say that they saw some Singaporeans being covertly racist against mainland Chinese people on MRTs or hawker centres with Chinese vendors.
19078,"The only incident of racism I've encountered, and not representative of anything but is interesting, is a sort of reverse racism amongst a bunch of Indian guys."
19079,The only people I call maids are in Akihabara.
19080,The only reason for expats leaving are covid restrictions.
19081,The only type of expat I welcome in SG are only those that contribute to help Singaporeans.
19082,Ultraman is an alien expat that always selflessly saves humans from monsters and crises.
19083,The current expats we welcome with open arms are like Godzilla.
19084,"Maybe the gov can give foreign worker levy rebate to employers if their foreign workers are tested proficient in English, especially those in service, F&B and retail industry."
19085,The only “economic refugee” quoted in the article is a Singaporean expat in Hong Kong.
19086,The opposition getting more powerful always seem to empower the racist xenophobe for some reason.
19087,While last year we hear a lot of something similar during the elections about controlling and minimising the flow of immigrants coming to Singapore.
19088,"While many of them are also in their 50's middle class who are pretty disgusted with foreign talents and keen on ""wanting to kick them out""   I have met and seen people on social media or my circle of friends barking on immigrants from the region for coming here and taking our ""jerbs"" and whatsoever."
19089,"Yet they are ""disappointed"" at the British who voted to leave the EU because of the same reason these Singaporeans have..  To kick out immigrants/foreign talents."
19090,This country was built on the back of foreign workers.
19091,The anti-Chinese racist bs he said was actually directed at Mainland Chinese.
19092,The other case maid survives- 3 weeks  Maid dies- 30 years
19093,"The other point to note is that, speaking from personal experience only, the vast majority of expats here were not sent here from HQ, but rather were either already in Singapore, or came here some time ago and moved jobs whilst here anyway."
19094,"Neither of these kinds of people will have expat packages, as they are just local hires."
19095,"The real culripts that led to the maid,  Ms Piang's horrific treatment and subsequent death is not simply on  Gaiyathiri."
19096,"The pay is low, but it enables maids to better provide for their families back home."
19097,"Our foreign domestic worker saved up and managed to build a new house back in Indonesia for her family of 10+, which she'd have not been able if she did not take up the sacrifice and job opportunity here."
19098,"But to some maids, they have close to no employable skillsets other than this."
19099,They said that OP’s point of view is racist.
19100,The people hiring in Adtech are always expats.
19101,"The people in a VTL are the elite of the elite and being the elite of the elite, they are not vulnerable to non-elite virus like covid-19."
19102,The people of Singapore have no issue with an Indian escpecially to the level of racism that you are concerned with.
19103,(I'm beginning to think that OP is a troll)  But there maybe subtle hints of racism that you may experience but I believe the same is everywhere.
19104,Just plain old racism xenophobia
19105,The people who believe that only 'under educated' or older folks are racist are the ones who have never experienced racism or know anyone that has.
19106,The people who come under CECA had to compete with others in a country with 1.3 billion population.
19107,The people who post xenophobic/racist comments online are the frustrated and stressed ones.
19108,Singaporean Indians experience close to zero racism in angmoh countries.
19109,The perfect irony is 2 years anniversary of her racist videos (barring the first one) she finally gets a Police Report.
19110,"IMO she knows what shes doing, mental issues aside it shouldn't be used as an excuse for her actions, shes intentionally being racist and blames everything thats happening and happened because of the past incident."
19111,"I'll take our Covid-19 response, already structurally and legally we mandate that migrant workers must be tied to their employers, and they have to accept the compulsory deductions for accommodations and food with no choice in the matter."
19112,Then we initially have a small outbreak among dormitory residents.
19113,"Not saying that you are, but expats who don't to train locals in order to maintain that gap is also a very big reality."
19114,"Up until recently, flying in more expats and just hiring locals who stay junior forever just so that they contribute to quotas was a very big reality."
19115,The photo of the guy stood behind the migrant worker whilst he's giving the interview is terrifying...
19116,"It reminds me of that whole ""I've not come across one migrant worker who has demanded an apology"""
19117,"While the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist."
19118,"It is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments."
19119,Yes we did something racist but we are totally not racist.
19120,It has never been the case that the purpose of RHD is to persuade people not to be racist.
19121,"That means almost every foreign uni fresh graduate going out into the workforce will be applying for this employment pass, I have a housemate who got it on a 3k salary."
19122,The point is most first generation immigrants will never see their adopted country as their mother  country.
19123,What makes it worse is that the victim is now summarised as the bad guy without even getting an explanation on what constitutes racism in this episode.
19124,The point is that there's a cap on the number of travellers that can enter on the VTL.
19125,"So, they designate flights as VTL to control the numbers."
19126,"The only way this would be racism would be if you think that African Americans are inherently inferior and less capable, all other factors being equal; and *that* would be racist."
19127,"The point is, it doesn’t matter if the PA “wins” this argument that they are “not racist”."
19128,The point of the scheme is to firstly control the number of immigrants and secondly let free market forces determine what kinds of immigrants we need.
19129,then the bids employers will be willing to pay would reflect that and there would result an optimal proportion of each profession within the total max number of immigrants the country decides it can accomodate.
19130,"The way I see it, having a FDW is a luxury much like owning a car."
19131,"If we let the free market decide who gets to have a car, why not FDW?"
19132,"Ultimately, if we want to reduce the phenomenon of overcrowding, the number of immigrant workers will have to be reduced."
19133,This should help you reduce how much racist thoughts you would feel.
19134,"Also the third video in the series focuses quite a bit more on the current situation of low-skilled migrant workers - once again, mostly descriptive, but says something in itself:   [Singapore (Current) Migration Situation (3 of 3 in series) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12slQGJ3sMg)"
19135,The other side is whether a large number of non-native ethnic group coming here be accepted by native community  The best example I can give you are domestic helpers.
19136,Most of us have no problem with them being here because we know they are transient workers.
19137,Our conception of racism is also going to change.
19138,We can now all look back and recognize that that was racist.
19139,"If you want to shape every conflict between two races as a matter of racism without clearly articulating instances from her speech or deliberately leaving out context behind how she treats the general student population, then that’s just acting in bad faith."
19140,The post you are referencing did not make the claim that they personally or expats individually were indispensable but that it will be a problem if the total number of expats dips significantly.
19141,The power disparity between maids and employers are too big.
19142,"An employer has too much control over a maid, and sometimes, people drunk on power can be very *cruel*."
19143,The maids themselves would not have much awareness of their rights and can be intimidated with a variety of tactics.
19144,An employer can “punish” a vulnerable domestic worker for perceived “offences” and what can the maid do about it?
19145,"Some domestic workers have to *pay to come here* ([on paper its up to 2 months deduction, but many paid for 6-9 months worth of fees](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/maids-foreign-domestic-workers-singapore-necessity-families-12059068)), and if you are a new maid, can you afford to walk out?"
19146,"And to compound all that, imagine the domestic worker is a shy “traditional” submissive woman."
19147,I think it would be a reasonable idea to make domestic worker agencies the actual employer.
19148,The people who require the services of a maid are simply engaging the services or leasing the maid from the agency.
19149,"That would at least provide some form of checks and balances on paper, while curbing the power of the person engaging a maid."
19150,"Perhaps maids could also be automatically rotated periodically (3-months) between different people leasing the services, if the maid do not consent to any extension of the period of service, which also empowers a maid."
19151,"Most importantly, previous denial of consent must be kept confidential, to prevent maid from fearing that they will be marked."
19152,"Even if the maids are abused, the exposure would be reduced and the maid can give feedback without fear, and the abusers could be blacklisted."
19153,More can be done and should be done to protect maids.
19154,"Reducing the power of the people engaging the services would be a good start, by making domestic workers an employee and not a just a lowly maid/servant."
19155,They have nowhere else to go as few countries want to take in retiree immigrants as opposed to the young who can still emigrate.
19156,"E: I think Brexit was a mistake, but blanketing the older generation as selfish and racist is extremely ageist and egotistical, and calling for a curb of voting rights of people who don't agree with you is trouble."
19157,"If you wanna argue semantics, then yeah technically you can say that everyone is generally racist because most cultures prefer dating their own race."
19158,The practice of lived-in maids should be stopped.
19159,And overall salaries of maids should increase.
19160,"Just like cars, those who cannot afford maids shouldn't have maids."
19161,"And yes, maid abusers should be put on a ban list."
19162,"Affirmative Action- racist, stuff like misusing someone's picture -racist."
19163,"At the end of the day, we will be cheapening the word and just like the story of the boy who cried wolf, eventually people would be numb to actual racism and ignore it when it's real"
19164,"I've already described my experience [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ntr14n/what_is_racism_in_singapore/h0wi1lq/) , as a landlord of over 13 years."
19165,Maybe the Singapore expat forum website has something going on.Hit me up if youre really bored.
19166,The problem is not all expats.
19167,The problem are expats who come here and bring over their army of friends and family who have fuck all credentials and bumfuck mentality.
19168,These other expats who earned their way here are now collateral damage.
19169,"In Australia, they have the IELTS requirements, but it makes sense because English is the mother tongue for most of the population so they have to make sure most immigrants can communicate with the people there."
19170,The problem is that racists usually hides from exposure by saying they are not racist.
19171,A country having three races will have racism.
19172,The problem is that some of those racist stereotypes aren't necessarily untrue.
19173,"On one hand, it seems really racist to say that, but on the other hand, there seems to be an element of truth to those stereotypes."
19174,"Is it still racist then, if it is an uncomfortable truth?"
19175,It'll likely be passed on to the foreign workers themselves.
19176,The problem is the over-reliance on our CMP sector on migrant workers.
19177,"Construction projects usually earns them lots of $$, i see no issue paying them more than office workers, just that CMP companies wants to earn more $$, exploit migrant workers with lower wages etc."
19178,"Edit: Its totally fine for renters to set the house rules/ preference to their best advantage, this is not racism."
19179,This assumption is the racism.
19180,The problem is when the kid becomes more attached to the domestic helper than the parents.
19181,One day the domestic helper leaves and goes back home.
19182,"The problem is when you are a local Singaporean with no skill and no education and all you can do is waiting tables then highly skilled, highly experienced and highly talented immigrants will surely take your jobs."
19183,"So, if you are a local Singaporean you better get your skills up cause the immigrants are coming to get your jobs."
19184,A lot of details are probably missing due to the maid's own ongoing court case.
19185,"But the article is definitely super confusing for people who didn't realise the type of scam that's going on here, and it kinda try to play into the ""rich people bad, maid exploited"" type of click baity hype"
19186,"No one objects to foreign workers doing things like cleaning or construction, though there is a critique there that Singapore’s become dependent on cheap foreign labour instead of pursuing a model with skilled higher-productivity (and higher-paid) labour."
19187,"(This is also not to deny that xenophobia really exists, because xenophobia totally does exist and crops up on occasion - as is easiest to see in how foreign construction workers are treated from time to time.)"
19188,The problem of xenophobia and the education system we have is inseparable.
19189,"When the government doesn’t pull the people up everything is justified, even the despicable racism we are discussing in this thread."
19190,"Unfortunately, I only see racism in Singapore get worse."
19191,"Unless Singaporeans learn to think critically, employ our capital to develop competitive companies we are at the mercy of the world and the only way we know how to respond when things don’t go as we want is to be racist."
19192,The problem start when the domestic helper become your step father or step mother and want a cut in the family business
19193,"The using of ""she is insinuating us to be racist"" was just a convenient excuse."
19194,Fixing it there is really more effective than hiring maids in Singapore.
19195,"I think just me taking the risk flying back/forth would be fine, plus I actually don't mind having to quarantine in SG if I don't take a VTL flight tbh."
19196,"The problem, and also why I asked this question, is that every single Singaporean online forum is overrun by racism and xenophobia these days: yahoo, sgforum, hardware zone, and of course tr."
19197,"I agree being racist would be very detrimental to Singapore, because it wants to be the hub for a lot of things."
19198,"Also, I want to point out that racism needs an easy target."
19199,The purpose of VTL is to allow tourism.
19200,If NZ doesn't accept tourists it makes no sense to have a VTL with them.
19201,"The purpose of the VTL is to avoid SHN, whether in home or hotel, partially because the fully vaccinated flight is safer for transmission during the flight compared to if there are unvaccinated people like on a regular flight."
19202,"The VTL flights don't just serve residents on trips out of Singapore coming back, but also foreigners coming in, which is why it's necessary to talk about how there will be unvaccinated people on the flights if there's no more VTL."
19203,If you befriend people on expat packages and end up paying their life you’ll be very quickly in debt.
19204,"People are not happy about immigration policy because they cannot tell if the immigrant was ""qualified""."
19205,The question is how does complaining about Singapore being an apartheid state on reddit help these foreign workers?
19206,>the main problem here which is the government has no interest in the mental welfare and life of dormitory residents  This may be controversial but have you wondered that the main problem here is just singaporeans in general not caring enough about these foreign workers.
19207,We held an election last year after the dormitory covid outbreak but the issue of foreign workers was not really debated or placed as a priority issue at all.
19208,People who don't really care about dormitory residents are not going to admit it here because they will probably get downvoted.
19209,This is just going to be another useless cycle of   News pop up about dormitory workers conditions --> some complaining about Singapore being a apartheid state but doing nothing concrete to help them --> time pass and people forget about it --> news pop up again about dorm workers conditions
19210,The question is whether the government will consider apologising but she answered the migrant workers did not demand for it.
19211,No one asked if the migrant workers demanded apology.
19212,"The racism in Europe, Canada, and Australia, barely extends to more than those towards Muslims and Blacks."
19213,You never hear about racism against Indians in the same way you get racism against Muslim and Blacks.
19214,"Muslims get a lot of racism in the West, but Muslims also have more problems with integration than they do in Singapore (religion can be a strong drive to segregate oneself, and Europeans never forcibly told them that it was wrong not to integrate due to the liberal values); once the ideological problems are sorted out, I think racism will die down."
19215,"I would also say that colorism wasn't a major issue in the West, but recently we've seen a lot of colorism and racism [and sexual racism] in the media against Indians; there are more Indians in Singaporean media, and discussion about colorism against Indians is more vibrant."
19216,"The racism in the comment above is just _chef’s kiss_  I am not even mad, it’s like clockwork!"
19217,"Whenever there’s anything related to Chinese privilege or racism, even if it’s an actual paper with clearly defined scope and methods and passed through the ethics board, racists will come out of the woodwork to defend racist actions."
19218,"If they’re not your personal values, and that they’re what HR managers have told you, did you go and find out if they’re valid and not that they’re based on racist stereotypes?"
19219,The racism she experienced is different from the racism in Singapore.
19220,"There is racism in Singapore and everwhere else because we (as a people) don't like other people who are different from us, and it is easy to blame them for that difference than to question our own prejudice."
19221,"We cannot eliminate personal prejudices, but we certainly do not institutionalise racism."
19222,The racist  scum that inhabit threads like these make me happy that I am leaving too alongside nearly every expat I know
19223,The racist comments have a tendency to float up.
19224,"The racist gymnastics one has to go through to buy into this explanation is fucking insane, and the fact that this has so many upvotes confirms my suspicions about Singaporeans."
19225,"This has nothing to do with foreignors suppressing wages and everything to do with the fact that there is a brewing racist sentiment among Singaporeans, actively promoted in subtle ways by BOTH workers party and PAP."
19226,Fuck you and everyone who upvoted this racist apologist garbage.
19227,There is a point where people blaming the government for their personal failures in life makes people easily susceptible to racism.
19228,The racist man got kicked out of his school but was he arrested?
19229,The victim can always go sue the racist for defamation if they want to.
19230,The racist part was assuming the mother tongue in the first place.
19231,"The real answer is expat usually implies a temporary relocation, while immigration is usually considered a permanent relocation."
19232,"The real question is, do you really think one form of racism is okay but racism against another isn’t?"
19233,Why does it matter what racist excuse the landlord makes?
19234,The real reason that these migrant workers are kept separate from us is not because the government fears that they will infect us.
19235,The real working world is full of blatant racism?
19236,Ok bro idk where u work but i dun think that’s v healthy...also the fact that u think that “growing up” means getting accustomed to casual racism and bigotry towards minorities as well as not working as a team is something else...
19237,The reality is there is an endless pipeline of such domestic workers for now.
19238,"I think enough words have been raised for whether there is racism in Singapore, whether individual incidences are racist or not and how the minorities feel."
19239,"Unless you are prepared to deny racists the right to vote, there are enough of these assholes around that it matters."
19240,The reason minor racism events and other alike events make the news is because nothing really goes on here (in terms of crime) so the media has a field day reporting on it
19241,"So when we see foreigners especially expats who benefit from our open leg foreign policy, earn more than us even when if we are in the same rank, get favouritism from companies without legal consequences yet whine like a little bitch because of a 3 week day delay for vaccination, we get angry."
19242,The rebate is for the employer for foreign worker levy charges which the employer pays out of their pockets.
19243,So is LKY trying to be racist?
19244,Is Mahathir trying to be racist?
19245,I don't think any of these two folks said any of these things with racist intent.
19246,People will perform the whole round of circus tricks to pry away from their own racist thinking and behaviours.
19247,I see so many posts where people are clearly racist but think they aren't and justify their reasons why they don't like Indian tenants.
19248,Racism is racism.
19249,"In fact, a construction worker’s job is more dangerous than a regular domestic worker’s."
19250,"Now Reddit being Reddit, there will be indignant cries that ""we won't do that"", ""that's racist""."
19251,Why is it racist to put up a sign that says “no Indians allowed” on a storefront but it’s racist to essentially put one up for an apartment listing?
19252,The risk of death only appears to be extremely low because the vast majority of our cases were young foreign workers who’ve been pre-screened for having no pre-existing conditions (otherwise they wouldn’t have gotten their work permit).
19253,"The rule is just vaccination and testing and ignores current infection rates, VTL just needs a 2-way agreement and those that reach a faster conclusion will be announced earlier."
19254,The rumour is there’s a gang called ohm that’s made of Malay people targeting the west and forcing malay boys to join their gang  The original message says “if you see a group of Malay boys approaching you walk away” So yeah this is a bunch of racist stuff
19255,The sad thing though is that some people don't treat maids not as they would a normal employee.
19256,None of these generalizations or offences by other foreigners excuse being a racist asshole to some innocent people.
19257,The saddest part is that most of the foreign workers (not just maids) don't have a recourse when they're wronged or abused.
19258,She didnt pay it because the maid was freelancing and earning a salary outside.
19259,The maid may have even paid the paper employer $$ for living costs and for colluding in the scam.
19260,"This casual racism, I think, is a result of  ignorance and following how others behave."
19261,"The same amount of medical personal will have to treat everyone and if we didn't have CB then elderly, foreign workers / people coming back from overseas, and young partiers won't follow ANYTHING so it would overload the whole medical system."
19262,Are both the issues not racism then?
19263,Or is it only a problem when minorities are on the other end of racism?
19264,The scary part of this (to me anyway) is that we’re only testing 3000 foreign workers but seeing 700+ cases.
19265,"The scary thing from the article is that his father and brother witnessed the incident, but the maid had to ask her neighbouring maid to call the police."
19266,"And if her neighbours don't have any domestic helpers, would she be able to seek their help?"
19267,"As dravidian7 above says, ""the fact that specific provision was made in traffic law to allow only migrant workers to be ferried in unsafe conditions already says enough about singapore."""
19268,"I know nothing about the law, but it seems insane that you could force your maid to pour hot water over herself, give her water mixed with detergent, and only get 3 years of prison."
19269,If you think there will be a resurgence of dialect speakers when almost the whole of Singapore can speak English and at least a smattering of their mother tongue then boy do I have penis enlargement pills to sell you.
19270,"Concepts like casual racism, to most in ""pragmatic"" and ""realist"" SG IME, are just the esoteric constructs of a frivolous mind."
19271,The situation with foreign workers is complicated.
19272,"I rather suspect that Singaporeans couldn't afford do these jobs for the wages that are currently offered - and that immigrant labour is used, because they can be paid less."
19273,The slowdown in the F&B sector are due to more than just expats leaving.
19274,"In addition to the above lowering their revenue per day, there are also restrictions on operating times and restaurants I know are facing a manpower crunch due to a lack of foreign talent."
19275,This is not racism.
19276,The so called racism is not so much about race but about people feeling too many jobs esp IT jobs going to certain foreigners if you go to Changi Business Park.
19277,Definitely more nationalism than racism.
19278,The racism from Chinese you got from your international schools are not from local Chinese as local Chinese don’t go international schools.
19279,They are probably from PRC Chinese or others who could be more racist.
19280,Frankly it’s probably the least racist country you can find compared to many western countries or other Asian countries like China or Japan or Korea.
19281,The solution is to raise the salary of Singaporeans to expat levels so they can pay like the expats can.
19282,"The sooner we can reduce our dependence on maids, the better."
19283,The standard insurance that’s offered to domestic helpers are too basic.
19284,"That's why I have no issues with labelling that kind of speech as racism, on a low-end scale, or a micro aggression as you call it."
19285,"In assuming that the image got approved and put up by people that isn't Muslim and that they are being racist, brings with it the implication that because the people involved aren't Muslim, they are inherently racist."
19286,Isn't that in itself a racist way of thinking?
19287,"The stereotype usually goes like this:  * Chinese Malaysian: oppressed * Chinese Indonesian: filthy rich, oppressed * Any other Malaysian & Indonesian: dirty Muslims / maids."
19288,"As for my linked comment, rather than crying about racism and discrimination, the CCP chose to take an active measure to correct the behaviour of their citizens because it has become quite undeniable that there is a pattern of rampant bad behaviour."
19289,"The pattern with PRCs seem to be reflected in Indian nationals, and I believe that responding to their behaviours by first protecting your own interest is a response born out of pragmatism (though not necessarily politically correct), not racism."
19290,"There is also a resistance against renting out to PRCs for the exact same reasons, but you don't see anyone crying foul over racism towards PRCs."
19291,The study was done on a “nationally representative sample” so naturally most (ahem chinese) wouldn’t think racism is an issue.
19292,I would be interested to know the proportion of our minorities that don’t think racism is an issue.
19293,So it includes even work pass or E pass or S pass holder.
19294,"The PO were wearing face shield, as well as the gown, one set was given to the General Worker (a migrant worker who was working OT without authorisation."
19295,"And they even had the gall to blame us for the increased cases and tried to blame us for being ""xenophobic""."
19296,The term Sinkies is racist and derogatory.
19297,The term expat is normally used to reference non-residents working in mid to senior level white-collar jobs.
19298,"Before or after covid19, most employers don’t let the maid out unless it’s their off day."
19299,"The term you're looking for, in Singapore foreign worker employment parlance, is ""repatriation""."
19300,"The testing cost is high:  >For a round trip on the air VTL, an individual traveller would need to fork out around between S$300 and S$650 on swab tests."
19301,">Meanwhile for the land VTL, an individual traveller would need to spend between around S$120 and S$170 for a two-way trip."
19302,"But then of the 30,000 people that have used the air VTL  >When asked how many travellers who entered Singapore via the VTL with Malaysia had tested positive for COVID-19 at the entry points, Singapore’s Ministry of Health told CNA that there were 42 imported cases from Nov 29 to Dec 31."
19303,What I don't understand is the cap of VTL flights that push their prices higher.
19304,"If you go to scoot you can the base price of KUL-SIN, 22$ for non-vtl, 400$+ for VTL."
19305,The thing about casual racism especially in a group of friends is the victims often keep quiet because they don't want to ruin the friendship.
19306,"Also they don't want to be called out as being oversensitive, playing the victim card, being told it's nothing compared to racism overseas like USA."
19307,"As such, all other things equal, higher wages for locals should be accompanied with lesser competition from foreign workers, else companies will always be able to get away with hiring foreigners for less."
19308,And the problem is precisely that the massive influx of foreign workers is what has allowed so many industries to get away with offering barely-livable salaries to their employees.
19309,"Also, regarding increasing the minimum wage for foreign workers."
19310,"I feel that while businesses are forced to increase the wages for foreign workers, they will also have to increase the minimum wage of Singaporeans."
19311,"In the end, hiring foreign workers will still be cheaper because Levi < CPF contribution."
19312,"The thing here is that a lot of low wage jobs are also being done by foreign workers (ie: construction, cleaning etc...)."
19313,These foreign workers are willing to work for low wages because to them it's a ton of cash in their country but to a Singaporean it's slave wages.
19314,"I’m not saying racism or discrimination in America is solved, but it certainly doesn’t have legal backing to thrive in the open in a way that affects housing or employment."
19315,Negative associations with being racist do influence behaviors over time / generations.
19316,I’ll definitely say if an employer or landlord was openly  racist then it really sucks for your own self confidence - especially since it basically says that society has deemed it as acceptable behavior given there’s no legal challenge to be made.
19317,But yeah - it’s not really about the pain of working for a closet racist - it’s more about setting legal precedent on what society deems as acceptable behavior with the intention to influence that behavior over time with legal backing.
19318,"The thing is people make insulting, racist , offending remarks etc and hide under the context “it is a joke”."
19319,"And while the situation with employee  rights in Singapore is far from ideal, at least it is still miles ahead of the FDW situation."
19320,"I think measures like capping work time can help a little, but so long as the base problem of FDWs not being able to change job at will remains there will always be tons of abuse."
19321,FDWs wouldn't want to make use of the law since it could mean losing a ton of money.
19322,"The thing is, Singaporeans mostly get what they want for estate upgrades but migrant workers don't get protected when it comes to transport."
19323,"It is interesting at what point do we draw a line on ""racism"" when there is data backing it."
19324,Forget domestic helpers - that's 100k AUD/year thx 6.
19325,"The thing is, people such as yourself who are not in the IT industry see it as racism because it sounds like we are saying they are bad because they do this, that's fine, it's understandable when you look at it from the outside."
19326,"But if so many people are saying it, people who work in the IT industry and have experienced it themselves, do you still shrug it off and say that it is racism?"
19327,"But you are entitled to your opinion and you don't have to take my word for it, just ask your friends who are in the IT industry in Singapore where majority of the workers in their company are indian nationals, if you still don't believe them and say that they are racist even though they are telling you their first hand experience then there's really nothing more to say."
19328,"The thing is, the person OP was talking about didn't merely state ""there's racism somewhere""."
19329,"The person said, and I quote OP, that Singaporeans should ""wake up"" to the racism, implying that there's a lack of awareness of racism present in certain instances, hence requiring the need for her to make it known."
19330,That's just plain racism isn't it?
19331,"The thing is, there was nothing racist in those ads, if you bothered reading."
19332,"The thing is, when people are outwardly racist and offensive, you can fight back, you can call them out or cut them out of your life."
19333,"This kind of racism is very deeply inset and hard to identify, and I really don't blame people who've not experienced it before in Singapore not being able to recognize it."
19334,"This, for some, could be fine, but seems everyone here enjoys complaining while wanting the HDB, upgrading to an EC, a Condo, then rent it to an expat."
19335,"When you have 10 expats leaving, it is not a big deal.When 50.000 are leaving, we are starting to have an issue.Maybe my landlord can come here on reddit and find another tenant for the condo where I live, for example - She is a local lady with a second property that no locals would rent (I would not, it would not be worth the money if I was a local)."
19336,"When it gets difficult to hire certain professions, and in certain fields, companies won't hire more locals, they will just move the hub somewhere else and leave maybe a few country managers or CEOs or Directors (and they won't be locals) and the minimum number of employees needed to run the local office.If Hong Kong did not have the current political issues that they are having, they would be able to capitalise a lot just by overturning the SG mistakes.Instead, SG is in a better position, and it has capitalised very decently from the (many) HK mistakes over the years - but if things will continue to go in this way, on the long run things will change and we will see more and more jobs done somewhere else, companies investing less money in Singapore, less expats, but less roles as well - anyway tons of jobs can be done remotely."
19337,The thing that needs changing is the mindset of too many that the maid is in someway their property to command and rule as they please.
19338,"My own co-workers often discuss chores for their maids when there are no more chores to do, they just come up with things to do so to get ""value for money""."
19339,Apparently they feel like they lose money if the maid is caught resting.
19340,"My co-workers are not bad people, they are regular moms in regular families, but somehow when it comes to maids they are barely worth more than their dogs."
19341,Come to think of it I think many of them would hesitate for a long time between saving a dog or their maid in such a scenario.
19342,"The thing that really tipped the scales of ""this is super racist"" was when the subtitles said ""[speaking Japanese]"" but it was just a series of extremely high-pitched garbled noises, that was like whoa goddamn"
19343,It's just an excuse for people to express their racism in a less direct manner.
19344,I'm an expat/foreigner working in Singapore and had a friend from Australia visit me.
19345,"So they're being discriminated against, but the western media consumed by you and the author has normalised the idea of ""Russians are the bad guys"" so firmly that it becomes acceptable and not racist."
19346,"So, some racism is okay, as long as it's not against races the author likes."
19347,"The suggestions are more along the lines of ""We should make it easier for experienced FDWs to change jobs and stay""."
19348,>Myanmar - which only last year passed a law allowing its nationals to work as domestic helpers overseas - will impose the ban **until an agreement is reached with Singapore over issues including worker rights and salary.
19349,"In any case- the blanket ban is hardly silly at all, the Myanmar government is just doing what it think is best for their people, specifically the domestic workers."
19350,"And through the pain, sorrows and frustrations of free speech, the US is a much less racist country that it was just a lifetime ago."
19351,The treatment of migrant workers in this country is a disgrace
19352,"Indeed, there are certain areas where strong local talent is lacking, and I’ve had to hire foreign talent myself despite paying above industry (abt $7-8K for a 5 YOE role)."
19353,"At the same time, there are tons of expats that are obviously replaceable and hired through cronyism."
19354,I have dozens of examples in my mind but my favorite is this - an expat was hired to fly halfway around the world to singapore to do a sales role with a single account which is a large local GLC.
19355,These applies to the expats coming to sg.
19356,"The truth is, the maid who brought me up with got pregnant by a married man who abandoned her while she was working for us."
19357,I am sure there are plenty of relationships with domestic helpers like us.
19358,My uncle's domestic helper refuse to get married or leave.
19359,"The survey, for the most parts, does not conduct quantitative comparisons between countries, it merely ""measures"" how satisfied the expats in each country are (similar to a happiness index) without a reference point."
19360,The type of people who can afford to travel to the countries likely to have VTL arrangements (read: rich / developed countries) are already aware of this - they mostly aren't the ones rooting for a more cautious approach.
19361,"However, the issue of using xenophobia as a disguise for racism is within the absolute control of our own nation and can be acted on fast before it spirals out of control."
19362,The underpinning of Singapore's racial harmony is a healthy sense of mutually casual racism.
19363,"What’s the equivalent for that, in our foreign worker problem?"
19364,The unfortunate reality is that spending to give better amenities to our foreign workers does not win the Government of the day cookie points with the voting population.
19365,"The issue is by and large, foreign workers who are in the non-domestic work and construction fields, particularly E-Pass holders, are hired for their greater skillset/productivity/experience, etc."
19366,"To be honest, I think the definition of racism is a little different as well."
19367,"You might even consider my understanding of such to be casual racism, but I'd ask you to look again at the Wiki page that I assume you found, and click on the link to epithet."
19368,"If you want a racist term, I'd consider gweilo to be more appropriate."
19369,"From [a letter written by a national serviceman to TWC2 in 2009:](http://twc2.org.sg/2009/06/29/no-comparison-between-lack-of-safety-in-worker-transport-and-the-standards-in-military-transport/)  >\[...\] when considering the difference between transporting workers on the backs of lorries and army personnel on military vehicles, one should take into account the following:   >   >a) Military vehicles **have sturdy chassis."
19370,The virus is xenophobic!!!
19371,"The way LMW spoke, a primary sch kid can also say this man is xenophobic against Indians"
19372,"When they deport the foreign workers at the start of CB for breaches, I am sure it is not due to racism and xenophobia  If i am going to take a crack and decipher this, the fault lines that she spoke about are along social economic lines instead"
19373,"Beyond the obvious maid abuse cases that make the news, if you have a look at some local helper hiring Facebook groups you can see the difference between foreign family job scope and a Singaporean family job scope."
19374,The way many people here look down to maids is disgusting.
19375,The way most Singaporeans treat their maids is disgusting.
19376,"The way singapores labor system supply system is, encourages racism, when you have a largely poor migrant population with very little rights."
19377,We should try to address this issue by advocating more rights for migrant workers and mimnimum wage.
19378,The way the Gov treats migrant workers is instructive of how they would treat poor Singaporeans if they could get away with it (if they didn't have the vote too).
19379,"The way the comment is phrased sounds very cold-hearted yes, but at least the commenter is one of those who ask the maid not to clean, better outcome regardless of motivations imo."
19380,"I rather every employer worry about getting into trouble (with proper regulations, education, enforcement etc) and stop making the maids do dangerous stuff, if that's what it takes to stop these accidents from happening ever again."
19381,"The way these people judge others, they’d probably go, “She’s Chinese so she can’t possibly be a maid!”"
19382,"It's useless trying to make people more aware of racism if instead of empathising the first comment is ""yeah go back to your place if you want rights""."
19383,"The way your family are treating their maid is abuse, plain and simple."
19384,"He accused the maid of stealing thousands of dollars of items, not just mere hundreds."
19385,"From a more meta perspective, there is also abuse of status and power involved as the maid's threats seems to be the motivation for them to frame her."
19386,It's not so much racist as much she's just looking down on you assuming you're of the same race as her.
19387,"The whole ""I'm sorry but racism will always exist it is impossible to eradicate :((((("" rhetoric always comes from the majority."
19388,Ask Malaysian Chinese what they think about bumi privilege and most of them will rant to you about how much it sucks rather than giving you the whole /r/sg approved lecture on the inevitability of racism.
19389,"The whole ""designated VTL flight"" concept is pointless bureaucracy, and Singapore is the *only country in the entire world* that is doing this."
19390,The deal here is that no one is doubting that we are doing all we can for migrant workers in this current day.
19391,"The whole point of VTLs were to avoid hassle, allow easy travel."
19392,The whole point of WP and FDW passes is to deny a pathway to citizenship.
19393,I’ll be pretty hard pushed to say that they are racist comments.
19394,"1) if it’s outright racist comment pretty sure mods would have removed it under reddit rules, don’t even need to talk about sub rules  2) just because you disagree with the comment doesn’t make it racist  3) just because more people disagree with you doesn’t mean it was brigaded"
19395,"The whole world is racist, everywhere you go, you will be differentiated because language and color."
19396,Blaming all your failures and bad luck on racism will get you no where.
19397,The wife of one of the dormitory operators who is a PA grassroots leader.
19398,Anything that has to do with race and offends people is racism now.
19399,The word your looking for is racism.
19400,"While they reflect the outlook and policies of the establishment People’s Action Party, which has ruled the country since 1965, they also reveal Wong’s thinking on some of the key challenges facing Singapore, from racism and immigration, to balancing China and the U.S., to climate change and the city-state’s economic future."
19401,"Open for Business...and Immigrants  Singapore has sought to carefully balance its need for an immigrant workforce, whether it be cleaners and laborers or doctors and executives."
19402,"Wong in June 2021 publicly took the conversation forward in a speech at the Institute of Policy Studies and the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, not just reaffirming the need for harmony, but calling for greater sensitivity among the majority Chinese population and stating flatly “racism still exists in Singapore.”  “Social media has helped to create greater awareness of racism here."
19403,The work permit holders I worked with have bank account?
19404,"What we need are better rules and protection for the maids, and for maids to know their rights."
19405,The worst situation for expats with family now is to lose their job in this economic downturn.
19406,"The worst thing about last year's dorm explosion is that it gave ""justification""/ammo to the internalized racism of these disgusting people."
19407,"The xenophobia as described here, is mostly attributed to other Asians who are occupying a great number of available job slots."
19408,This is a colonial and subconsciously racist kind of love.
19409,Their business was reliant on a high number of tourists and a steady stream of foreign workers.
19410,Yet this is how we treat our migrant workers.
19411,Yet this is being made into an issue about racism.
19412,Their last article on a migrant worker's attempted suicide was slammed for having a headline picture that showed part of the man's body.
19413,Them: Treat brownface as “just a joke.” Minorities should dismiss acts of racism because they are always “unintentional” or “accidental”.
19414,"They can do whatever they want, no matter how racist?"
19415,Then I don’t think that’s racist?
19416,"Again, like I said and will say for the 3rd time, that if you simply don’t want to date a particular race because you think they all behave in a certain way, then yes it is racist."
19417,Then I guess you love racism.
19418,Then I would say that your definition of racism is too reductive.
19419,"In other words, decrying the cultures of other ethnicities (or races) is just as racist and morally unsustainable as decrying their skin colour."
19420,"It would be funny to watch someone compare Kong Hee's 3+ years for 50 million vs Ab Mutalif's 2+ years for 370k  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-mosque-leader-gets-27-months-jail  Because then she'll need to give her opinion on the right ""money-to-jailtime"" ratio, and the focus would shift away from her Singapore-is-racist angle to legal matters."
19421,Then accept that ur racist.
19422,Then all maids should be guaranteed their own private bedrooms along with 3 proper meals if that's the case.
19423,Then apologise and say you will address any other incidents that might give the impression of racism.
19424,"If you are, then it was your fault because we are not racist."
19425,We take umbrage at you calling us racist now you're the bad guy and we will not listen to you anymore.
19426,Then call all other developed countries irrational and xenophobic.
19427,She calls out racism in SG (which isn't proven in the screenshots) but remains silent on overt discrimination and racism against minorities in the country she represents.
19428,"Seeing how much dormitory owners were profiting, I am willing to bet that HDB flats are extremely profitable."
19429,Then go work as a maid...
19430,Then how do other developed countries do it without such a prevalent and robust maid-industry?
19431,"What happens when the current countries we draw our maids from become prosperous, and the thought of working for S$600/mth becomes ludicrous to them?"
19432,Which next poor country will we harvest our maids from?
19433,Then how do you explain casual racism against local Indians which started as early as when they were kids and happened in schools with teachers / other students often being the bully?
19434,It's not unique to maids.
19435,"Many Singapore households use live-in maids as a crutch and underpay maids for the amount of work they do, and many employers don't give them the living standards they deserve."
19436,Do not misconstrued being rich with racism or whatever privilege other than class privilege!
19437,"Then it's a good thing that there are less expats, the situation will get worse if they return"
19438,Then it's sheer racist.
19439,"Then its a good thing the people you know are in the minority and treat their maid with respect and dignity, ive met so many people who are on the other end of the spectrum who have their own prejudices against foreign maids from most of the countries which supply maids, ive noticed it mainy boils down 2 to 3 countries, they either hail from indonesia, myanmar or the philippines."
19440,"Ive personally witness my colleagues berate their maid infront of guest since she couldnt understand what limited english she could comprehend since she was new, but her ""master"" expected her to be fluent so as to better serve them and their guest."
19441,"It seem it was a normal occurrence for her since the host wife kept telling the maid that it was not the first time they had to repeat it to her, all the maid could do was nod."
19442,Then just allow any carrier to serve VTL flights.
19443,"Possible that he's a racist, but also possible that he just doesn't like you and it has nothing to do with race."
19444,Can't really prove that he is a racist unless you also see across the board discrimination based on race.
19445,Then only the richest in Singapore can afford FDW.
19446,Then you create another problem leaving hundreds maybe even thousands of these domestic workers  without a job.
19447,Then she will go Facebook and post that she can’t take care of her kids without a maid and that the government is punishing Singaporeans like her.
19448,Then people who read her post will curse the government for barring a mother from hiring a maid and they will threaten to vote for another party
19449,Then that classmate is racist for automatically associating the attitude with the Malay race as a whole instead of just that individual.
19450,Then the line managers to FDWs should also have KPIs as per commercial organisations.
19451,Better to frame it as what if a PD ambassador or organiser has mentioned racist remarks in the past.
19452,"If the person is indeed dirty, and you reject his tenancy on the basis of him being dirty, then it is not racist, regardless of what race he is."
19453,"However, if you jump the gun, and assume that the tenant is dirty simply because he/she is race A or B, when he/she has not even visited your house yet, then this is certainly racist."
19454,"Probability or not, to judge someone by only their skin colour, is the very definition of being racist."
19455,Forming stereotypes and assumptions of a particular race just because of your singular personal experience is also racist.
19456,"Then the title should be more like ""discussion on racism in sg (with housing rental as example)"" what, why frame it as a renting wuestion"
19457,"I know one,  one of my relative this sort of pattern de,  no maid but she just get her parents to do her chore under the pretense of take care of grand child"
19458,I see maids cleaning cars at my condo.
19459,"I assumed by mistreatment you meant tightening immigration policies, making it harder for immigrants to enter the country."
19460,"I feel this happens more towards foreigners working in lower income, less glamorous jobs like domestic helpers/construction workers."
19461,"And BTO delays are politically unpopular, more so than how migrant workers are treated."
19462,Is that racist?
19463,This is racist and is wrong.
19464,But whether that “racial preference” is benign or hate-filled racism is unknowable if the person so choose to hide them.
19465,"My point was that plenty of developed countries exploit people, whether migrant workers or not, for their own benefits."
19466,Do you suggest we put these migrant workers under such circumstances too?
19467,Then what exactly is the economic benefit that these expats bring?
19468,"We definitely need tech/engineering talent to remain competitive, but I don't see the point of having people like that Yorkshire guy in recruitment or white expats in middle management positions that can easily be done by a local."
19469,Then why are work permit holders that do not reside in dorms not considered part of community cases?
19470,Then why do we (as a society) deny so many basic human rights to the domestic workers in Singapore?
19471,"I have no respect for big corporations profiting off the plight of foreign workers, especially with such a cheap shot campaign."
19472,Then you are not racist but xenophobic for assuming that every single Indian national behaves in the exact same manner.
19473,My friend group says racist jokes that absolutely cannot be said out in public in Discord calls all the time to each other.
19474,"Yes, let’s do make immigrants assimilate."
19475,"But wait, does Singapore want immigrants?"
19476,Because a country can totally set itself up for immigration but only when it is accepting immigrants.
19477,Today’s policies - especially the lack of employment opportunities for spouses - mean it’s not immigrants who are coming.
19478,There already are robots cheaper than what you pay maids in a month.
19479,But I think a maid is an all-in-one solution and probably more reliable because robots have no capacity for the 'human touch'.
19480,"There are *one million* foreign workers in Singapore, not 20000."
19481,"There are 300,000 foreign workers in Singapore now."
19482,"There are a great many examples in history where citizenship tests (including language proficiency) has been used for *explicitly* xenophobic and racist reasons, with the US providing the majority of those examples."
19483,"There are a lot of ""racism is a part of life, it's not a big deal in Singapore"" type comments here, and while I agree to an extent that the situation in Singapore is not so bad, it definitely feels like people trying to make excuses/maintain the status quo."
19484,I think step one is recognising that racism *does* exist in different forms here.
19485,"Any discussion on racism, even here on Reddit (the so-called liberal echo-chamber) always gets the same responses trying to dispute minority experiences as a preference, harmless jokes or overreaction."
19486,"There needs to be a larger societal understanding of race-based issues before there'll be enough support to tackle systemic racism, some examples of which have been brought up in this thread (job application discrimination, SAP schools)."
19487,Comparing their handphone restrictions to that of domestic workers is completely pointless.
19488,"&#x200B;  I dont know why some people have the mindset that if your a maid, your essentially a ""paid slave"", and will treat you like the latter."
19489,"&#x200B;  Like not allowing the maid the day off on sunday since their worried what their maid will do like get a boyfriend, get pregnant, borrow money from loan sharks etc."
19490,"There are alot of closeted racist and bigots here, its just takes the right situation and ethnicity to ignite the flames of hate."
19491,"By throwing xenophobia into the mix, this sub is muddying the discourse into a bipartisan moral issue about foreigners, which in this case is really not all that relevant."
19492,There are also much larger clusters in the community now... so why does the government feel the need to 'protect' the migrant workers while the rest of the community gets used to an endemic covid?
19493,"In this context, 'protecting' them is clearly being used as an excuse to maintain the status quo out of overcautiousness, with relatively little consideration of the wellbeing of these poor migrant workers."
19494,I'm surprised that the study was fixated exclusively on racism while ignoring very real considerations that employers must take.
19495,There are also some racist gen z with non-racist boomer parents
19496,However maids are adults and should take responsibility for their actions.
19497,"If my maid try to borrow money from me and I say no, does it make me an indecent human being?"
19498,"There are bound to be xenophobic comments but as what OP has mentioned, the concern of many is mainly with prevention of the disease itself."
19499,"If everyone could express themselves as objectively as OP does, Politicians would not be able to smoke their way through by calling all banning measures xenophobic."
19500,"There are brewing racist sentiments, I agree, but I don't agree that it's due to WP fanning them."
19501,I don't condone violence in this case nor racism here.
19502,"Considering that the government is actively supporting them, it is understandable that there are a few aspects where the foreign workers would be expected to compromise."
19503,"Meanwhile, the moaning about racist accusations you see in Reddit is just Chinese fragility."
19504,There really should be an ombudsman of some kind that domestic workers can immediately reach.
19505,"There are different kinds of xenophobia, it would be unwise to downplay any of it."
19506,The same goes for racism and privilege.
19507,You probably assume that racism in Singapore is like racism in Norway.
19508,Lots of people try to tell me about my country's racism problems against people of color.
19509,They have *no idea* about how racism really is in my country because they *aren't American*.
19510,You can't pretend to understand another country's racism just because your country also has racism.
19511,There are easy ways to silently protest this rule such as reading a novel by the pool while your maid is swimming.
19512,"Having said that, there have been many many examples of white expats behaving badly and arrogantly in Singapore, hence the hate."
19513,"Just google it and you'll see - expat cyclists hogging the road and being rude, beating up taxi drivers, or insulting the whole country on their facebook page."
19514,Even better if you're willing to integrate and hang out at our local places instead of what most expats do - which is drink at expat bars.
19515,"That or hire a maid, or let the grandparents take care of it."
19516,There are in fact far more Malaysia immigrants in Singapore than PRC ones (44% vs 18%).
19517,[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrants-in-spore-mostly-from-malaysia](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrants-in-spore-mostly-from-malaysia)  People think that this will only affect PRCs but I suspect this will affect working class Malaysian immigrants the most.
19518,expats.
19519,"Going by your 'racist', 'discriminatory' logic, all of these are discriminatory to some extent."
19520,"All other political correctness and fear of xenophobia aside, how different would our situation be?"
19521,Hope that more people can translate this angst to something that would actually help the migrant workers.
19522,"The accusation of racism is not leveled at the (1) issue, but at the (3)."
19523,"&#x200B;  To aid you to better understand your landlord's position,  Landlords are liable for criminal prosecution if there are illegal immigrants found in their rented property, so landlords prefer to be risk-adverse when it comes to issues like this."
19524,There are non sq VTL flights.
19525,"As such, they are counted separately from the dormitory workers, and are part of the local community instead."
19526,"That being said, since MOH separates the cases into dormitory/non-dormitory, it also means that the new cases are disproportionately affecting those that are earning less, and can only afford to stay in dormitories."
19527,There are other costs to consider for expats.
19528,"Once other asian countries rise up and migrant workers can get a fair wage in their country, why would they want to get SG wages, especially when we do not have minimum wage laws?"
19529,"""As usual beating the dead horse with comparisons made with our ancestors""  This is a cop out for you to avoid recognising the double standards   Did I say the immigrants here now are your ancestors?"
19530,No... but for most locals here their ancestors were immigrants and they shouldn't have to face the same abuse as people now...  why should the compassion be lost just because the people now are not related to you?
19531,Some overseas singaporeans are assaulted just like some are assaulted here in singapore... that doesnt mean you can ignore the rampant issue of xenophobia and racism that exists here.
19532,Bringing up their finances or anti LGBQT laws also achieves nothing for your point here because it is irrelevant  You say such assaults etc almost always feature expats..  1) is this based on statistics?
19533,"There are plenty of Indians earning hefty packages often more than ang mohs, are they expats as well or immigrants?"
19534,"There are plenty of laws prohibiting maid abuse, and making abuse of maids more harshly punished than regular hurt offences."
19535,"There are racists in every country, does that make every country racist?"
19536,All this results into the general cultural view that English > the original mother tongues like Malay.
19537,There are some ielts books on NLB's ebook catalogue.
19538,"There are some major racists in France as well and some of it can be really in your face racism, but yeah there are a lot more people ready to denounce it."
19539,"https://i1.wp.com/blog.truuue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-12-at-10.36.45-am.png?resize=1000%2C532&ssl=1   Then again, that's because the rental market IS pretty racist by itself."
19540,The economic impact that we face is because of our racism in seeing them as a detriment.
19541,There are still expat packages and you can be an expat but you are never going to get expat package in your own country or a country nearby.
19542,A Singaporean will never have a expat contract in Singapore but a German will never have a expat contract in Germany.
19543,There are still those amongst us who would put migrant worker (and perhaps domestic workers) in the 'lesser human beings' category.
19544,There are tons of non-SQ VTL flights from Europe back to Singapore?
19545,give lot of money to locals and happy to take construction jobs) or simply xenophobic comments from some of us.
19546,As expatsingaore or other forums complain a lot of almost zero chances of getting PR for Others category how did the folks manage to get residency here?
19547,"Nobody is asking for 5 star hotel accomodation for foreign workers, despite whatever strawman Ben Leong cooked up."
19548,Nobody expects 0 migrant worker infections.
19549,"If you are very dark-skinned, expect to be stared at and to face a little casual racism."
19550,We're up there with HK and Dubai in terms of domestic helper abuse / deaths lol  Edit: Why are you downvoting lol - which of these 2 statements is a lie?
19551,Tbh we could have shipped the migrant workers back but we did not.
19552,"My grandmother had a maid, she took 200 dollars, brandished a kitchen knife and left the house with the keys."
19553,However one should distinguish them from the racists who want to use the ceca agreement as an opportunity to sow discord within the community(by pushing their anti-Indian bigotry)and do not care one iota about the future of our country.
19554,There has always been racism in Singapore.
19555,But I can't resonate with you that racism has ever been normalized officially.
19556,"The only moment I can relate to is among your own circle, pressured by peer pressure to reluctantly accept racism."
19557,This can't be seen as institutional or structural racism though.
19558,"There's only so much the laws can do to prevent racism, it's ultimately rest on the people to end racism."
19559,If this keeps up domestic helpers will be banned.
19560,"There has to be more to this than meets The Eye, the employer has to pay a foreign worker levy for The Maid."
19561,There have always been plenty of racism towards Indians behind closed doors.
19562,"(And I'd be more shocked (and if there are plenty of) the younger the racist gets, as over the years of living here and mingling with the locals, I thought people of my age will be anti-racist even more."
19563,I nearly do not hear any stereotypes that leads to their racism towards a certain race.
19564,"As long as we have freedom of thought, no amount of education or interaction with other ethnicity & culture will eradicate racism."
19565,There have been cases of maids as young as 13 being brought in with fake passports.
19566,"CECA, Work Passes, Foreign Talents) 4."
19567,Its not like the employer is the maids legal guardian and every facet of that individual's personal life is the concern of the employer.
19568,Are Singaporeans even this worried about their children in relationships getting pregant as they are about their maids?
19569,"There is a cap on rent in most expat packages, based on your seniority and your pay in your home country."
19570,Not every expat can just choose to stay on Nassim because they want to.
19571,Sometimes these 'expats' may move from countries not as well off as SG and hence the 'expat' would need a rental allowance to adjust for purchasing power parity.
19572,There is a difference between attracting foreign talent to stay and having a conducive environment for those on corporate rotation.
19573,There is a difference between eating humble pie and learn and admitting you are a racist.
19574,"To me, the fact that you can't see why this is problematic perfectly encapsulates the racism in Singapore."
19575,"Nobody chooses to date anyone, as long as they are a certain race (racism), income level (classism), age (ageism) etc."
19576,Rental or hiring practices where a candidate is chosen entirely based on race is racism.
19577,"Go find out the working conditions, lack of adequate social nets and salaries of our migrant workers that make this possible."
19578,"There is a lot of racist comments in this subreddit as well, although is not as bad as in some other forums"
19579,There is a market economy for maids.
19580,"If they raise it, people will hire Myanmar and Indonesian over Filipino maids."
19581,Anyway the quota on Filipino maids is going down in recent years.
19582,"There is a pathway for them - for migrant workers, at least."
19583,"I have colleagues who are pr, they only have the equivalent of high school qualification in China and came to Singapore as a migrant worker on work permit, now after 20 years in singapore they are prs."
19584,"There is a perception, not unfounded, that like Indians abusing H1B visas in the United States, Indian nationals are abusing the [CECA agreement](https://mothership.sg/2019/11/what-the-heck-is-ceca-should-you-be-angry-at-it-explained/) to unfairly dismiss locals and import PMETs from India."
19585,"There is a situation with someone close to me, who was confronted with intensely racist and violent remarks of a co-worker (including suggesting death) targeted towards a specific racial group, that he/she belongs to, via a personal blog post."
19586,"I would think that the rights of free speech do not extent to hateful, vehemently racist slurring and suggesting bodily harm, even if these take place outside of the workplace."
19587,"Case in point, we made racist jokes to a Malay guy who laughed and we got him to make Chinese racist jokes at us."
19588,Dark skinned folks definitely do experience racism in Singapore.
19589,There is around 300k migrant workers.
19590,50k migrant workers infected means around 1/6 of migrant workers infected.
19591,"There is no ""reverse-racism""."
19592,Racism is racism.
19593,You can be racist against Chinese in Singapore.
19594,"Similarly, you can be racist against whites in America."
19595,"There is no application needed for Singaporean/PR using the VTL, only foreigners and long-term pass holders."
19596,"In my view, some proponents of the current views on racism have veered too far in benefit of the offended, and this lacks grounding in reasonableness."
19597,There is no freaking way that 2k is the compensation in lieu notice given the amount that most maids earn.
19598,"Also maids, like all employees are ultimately entitled to leave their employment if they want to, even if they can't pay compensation in lieu of notice."
19599,"This means that you have a right to sue your maid in court for breach of contract and go after their assets (but the legal costs will make it not worth it tbh), but you don't have right to take the law into your own hands and physically force the maid to continue to work for you, which is what the OP is claiming."
19600,Also the maid is clearly not willing to work on Sunday.
19601,"This maid clearly doesn't want to work on Sunday, so this pay in lieu excuse cannot apply."
19602,"Singapore's law is blind theoretically whether the person is a Singaporean, PR, immigrant or tourist - the same rules apply throughout."
19603,"On expats flouting distancing laws, Shan had clarified that the accused had claimed trial and thus ""nothing could be done until the court deals with it""."
19604,People coming via VTL have to test negative for Covid just before arriving here.
19605,The entire VTL scheme is smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of progress without actually making any.
19606,"The Category (I, II, III, IV) system is perfectly adequate and VTLs are not needed at all."
19607,"Cat II should just have similar rules to that which VTL does now, you show up and take a test and that's it, no matter which flight you come on if vaccinated, possibly some quarantine or extra testing if unvaxed."
19608,"VTLs just create artificial demand for a few anointed flights, most of them on SIA (wonder why /s) without actually doing anything useful"
19609,There is no racism in Ba Sing Se
19610,There is no reason to be racist.
19611,"Personally, I believe the manifestation of racist behaviours stem from stereotype."
19612,"We all can do our part by not reinforcing the stereotype, on the other side of the same coin, we also must have self conscious and not to engage in certain behaviour that would reinforce the racist belief."
19613,Shut the fuck up internet racist troll.
19614,In both cases for migrant domestic worker (aka maids) or migrant work permit holders (aka foreign worker) it’s a minimum amount they must be covered for.
19615,"According to MOM’s current requirements, the employer of a work permit holder is required to buy health insurance coverage of at least $15,000 per year, which is to cover inpatient care, day surgery and hospitalizations."
19616,"The highest tier of coverage for work permit holders I can find is Liberty’s “Superior” plan, which covers up to $50,000 per disability"
19617,The biggest expat job share is taken up by Malaysians.
19618,Anyone that says that it is racism is as ridiculous as the wumaos that call any criticism of the PRC racist.
19619,"There is racism, is it as bad as other countries?"
19620,"As for your case, with your accent you'll face much less racism, but if you're dark skinned people might not be so welcoming at first till they hear your accent."
19621,If you're growing up here then you'll definitely experience racism.
19622,"There is some sinister thing given how every week we have a new racist incident, and i doubt there are good intentions when she crowdsources hatred."
19623,"But not all migrant workers experience the same issues because they work in different industries, have different employers, different housing situation and come from different backgrounds."
19624,There is something really wrong with how Singaporeans see their maids.
19625,"I'm not even talking about these extreme abuse cases, even the average maid employers seem to view their maids like they are subhuman slave creatures."
19626,"They don't ask their maids nicely, heck or even in a neutral tone."
19627,"There is something they call a ""serviced apartment"" which is a longer term hotel stay in a place with a small kitchen, but with a few hotel ameneties like maid service."
19628,"There is still a deeply ingrained racism in Singaporeans, especially those middle class people that went to chinese schools."
19629,"not allowed to speak out about racism in public/media, doesn't mean that there is no racism."
19630,"People just get better at **hiding** their racism, rather than actually learning not to be bigoted."
19631,It is sensible to not want migrant workers in dorms around them.
19632,"There is without doubt racism here in Singapore sadly, however xenophobia is a much bigger issue imo."
19633,There isn't overt displays of racism like beating up someone of a particular race as they walk down the street.
19634,"It's more of ""microaggressions"" or in this case ""microracism""."
19635,"You'll find undertones of racism in the little things, like the minorities are usually the butt of race related jokes."
19636,"So, I don't think the level of racism here is THAT bad, compared to many other countries."
19637,There may not be language barriers but expats are still more comfortable in their mother tongue.
19638,There need to be more protection for the rights of our foreign workers.
19639,This could've been so easily prevented if there is a structure in place for integration and continuous monitoring of FDW health.
19640,"I always see their store at serangoon, the maid must always sit on one row of chair, sit straight and look straight and presentable like in army."
19641,There needs to be clearly demarcated and established rights for foreign workers in the form of a bill.
19642,Violation of fundamental rights of FDWs should expose the employers to definitive jail time.
19643,This is far more serious because FDWs are in vulnerable positions that employers can choose to exploit against them.
19644,"Punishments also need to be heavier for domestic employee abuse, the things that these employers do to their maids are simply horrific."
19645,"For example, people who want to hire domestic helpers need to be subjected to more stringent vetting requirements."
19646,"Look at the people joining ISIS, most recruits in western countries are 2nd generation immigrants from middle eastern countries."
19647,"Is it really because of foreign talent coming in to take up these spots, or is it that engineering doesn't have a good ""image"" with Singaporeans?"
19648,"This is where the Singapore government is lacking, and because of that many Singaporeans might feel a sense of distrust towards welcoming more immigrants."
19649,There was a thread recently about the two girls who got attacked in Melbourne and people here were saying it's not surprising that Aussies are so racist.
19650,Experienced very little racism.
19651,But I met Singaporean Chinese who'd cry about how racist the Aussies are.
19652,I can tell you about so many racist incidents I've encountered since young.
19653,I appreciate a good racist joke that makes even my non-Indian friends uneasy.
19654,I don't think racism is going away.
19655,It may not fit the narrative that Chinese are racist but there is an undercurrent of AMDK in Singapore still.
19656,"There was one morning at Clementi central, I passed by this money lender store and saw a long line of maids queuing waiting for the store to open."
19657,"These forummers have no problem posting racist tirades against Singaporean minorities, yet demand doxxing and vigilante action towards Avjit Panaik."
19658,I tapped his shoulder and asked him to calm down and let the taxi come to them because there was a 4th taxi trying to get into the bay from the other lane and blocking traffic (it was a loading unloading area so taxi had to turn in coz trucks were in the way)    He turned around and shouted that he has lived in Singapore for longer than I have been alive and that I am racist coz I am bullying someone of different color.
19659,Sure this is a sad incident but you will spot the occassional racist somewhere which is sad.
19660,First were the complains by migrant workers to the press on how MOM has ignored their plea for justice from the unscrupulous employers.
19661,So how do you think migrant workers feel?
19662,There were xenophobic comments
19663,"There will always be some expats, and the populists are just going to double down and blame them."
19664,"Even if they run out of expats, they can blame the PRs, and if they run out of PRs, they can blame non-native born Singaporeans."
19665,"Unless we get someone with some balls like LKY (I doubt it), this xenophobia spiral is going to get a lot worse."
19666,There will always be some racism in places where people have mostly lived their lives around those who look like them.
19667,"It helps that overt racism is frowned upon in Singapore (as opposed to how common Asian jokes/slurs are in the west), but we can do more to subvert the subtle form of racism by simply calling it out when we see it."
19668,"It's not politically correct to do so, but really, educating people is a good way around racism (which is just another form of ignorance anyway)."
19669,These foreign talents have no strong roots to this country.
19670,There would also be a lot more permanent immigrants from angmohland if Singapore allowed dual citizenship and made it possible for their kids to choose if they want to do NS and be Singaporeans.
19671,VTL just ain't gonna work.
19672,"So if your budget is, say $4k a month for a role, then it IS possible that an expat will go for the full 4k since he/she will get similar offers elsewhere (maybe outside SGP), while a local might possibly settle for 3.5k if they don't have similar leverage."
19673,"I mean the HR people not always going to keep waiting for someone to agree at 3.5k, they'll save time and just hire the expat at 4k."
19674,There are expats who want to put down their roots but are not given a chance despite having stayed for years together.
19675,Odds are stacked against the expat.
19676,If they get a higher salary that is to meet this cost of living while they are staying put in SG as expats.
19677,There's /singapore in racism
19678,I think the couple made their stance very clear with their racist allegations though.
19679,"Because, I honestly think calling this incident racism is really a huge stretch and undermines actual racism that happened recently."
19680,There's a fine line between common sense and racism with regards to border closure.
19681,"Just because *some* people are pushing for border closure due to racism, there is also merit in pushing for border closure from a pandemic prevention/reduction standpoint."
19682,"Just because there are people who are racist arguing for border closure, doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do."
19683,"Basically, what they do is take calls from migrant workers, note down any concerns they may have and try to assist in handling   Can just look up here with you - migrants helpline for the page."
19684,Locals tend to request a lower salary than an expat might - whether this is because they've previously been paid less or whether they have lower expectations for the same job is somewhat irrelevant.
19685,There's a word for that---racism.
19686,And I would like to point out that for a good portion of the 1980s-2000s were rather free from blatant display of racism or xenophobia.
19687,So I disagree with how you claim that Singaporeans (as a whole) have been xenophobic since 1959 as a whole.
19688,"There's basically no rules, FDWs are specifically exempted from the Employment Act."
19689,There's definitely racism of course.
19690,Is there a country without racism?
19691,"More importantly, **it's really up to everyone to call out racism when they see it**."
19692,"It's useless to say you see your friends practice racism and then do nothing about it, then come to Reddit and say."
19693,"There's is no real harm in having a ""closer than normal"" relationship with your helper (or maid, which is the more common local term for it)."
19694,These closer relationships usually manifest themselves in expat households as opposed to local ones.
19695,"This is a very broad statement, but there have been cases of maids having taken advantage of their employers' kindness, resulting in a gradual slipping of standards of duty, taking things for granted and generally stepping over the employer/employee line."
19696,There's just no choice for the migrant workers.
19697,"There's less racism now, I think?"
19698,I remember the community recovery centres being set-up for dormitory residents where the outbreaks happened.
19699,"People genuinely believed that migrant workers wanted to chaokeng, when the reality was that - infected or not, life as a migrant worker in a dormitory was terrible the first few months of the pandemic,"
19700,"There's no ""open immigration policy"" - most policies regarding immigration have been steadily tightening since ~2011."
19701,"There's no VTL outbound flights, only inbound to Singapore though"
19702,There's no racism in Ba Sing Se.
19703,"Nevertheless,  I feel that the immigrants are coming here too fast that our housing and public services are struggling to keep up."
19704,There's nothing racist about this at all.
19705,"Heck, there were calls to ban All flights from China early on in 2020 (but we all know how that turned out) and even that had nothing to do with race/racism."
19706,There's nothing to be xenophobic about.
19707,PA says they are not racist because they have grassroots org X and Y.
19708,"They can deny allegations of racism, but their statement essentially calls the victim out by insinuating that PA cannot be racist, she's the racist one stoking tension by self-victimizing."
19709,There's nothing wrong against maids asking for more benfits.
19710,What singaporeans are complaining about is unethical poaching of FDWs by agencies.
19711,Say you paid an agency a fee to help you find an FDW and process the paperwork.
19712,"Thats all well and good, until the same or another agency then approaches your FDW and says they can earn more elsewhere, and to leave you."
19713,"Then, you're out of luck, because FDW now wants to leave you."
19714,"If an FDW is unhappy with her circumstances, and seeks new employment, I think that's fine and totally legit."
19715,There's only 2 VTL flights from the US per day.
19716,"There's only 6 VTL flights a day, compared to 30+ before, so with the higher prices I don't think we'll see many tourists."
19717,"There's probably some racism involved, but I don't think it's borne out of malice rather than one of ignorant stereotypes."
19718,There's racism on every race's part.
19719,There's racism towards whites?
19720,People might call them racist.
19721,"And we need to wait at least 2 more weeks to know if none of the couple thousand foreign workers have infected anyone in the community or not, which is unlikely."
19722,There's this lady at my boyfriend’s workplace who treats everyone at work with a lot of kindness and respect and he was shocked when she shouted at her maid and insulted her over the phone during work last week.
19723,It makes me sad that she’s probably one out of many Singaporeans who see their maid as lesser human beings.
19724,Theres lots of racism directed at relatively disadvantaged local minorities.
19725,There’s a difference between being racist and tolerating other races and being racist out loud.
19726,I an well aware of Singapore’s lowkey racist culture.
19727,I am however unfamiliar with how outspoken racist insults and slurs and casually thrown around in the workplace
19728,There’s a regulation that prohibits sexual activity for the foreign and domestic workers?
19729,"Is it so hard to believe that out of the massive 200k foreign workers, some of them may not be getting the “high quality” food that the Govt says they are getting?"
19730,There’s always two types of racist comments.
19731,At first I joked back too since they are my friends/classmates but overtime it got stale and annoyed and its very stereotypical and that’s what probably led me to call out casual racism now.
19732,"There’s been a lot of discussion lately on racial discrimination, the foreign worker situation, COVID-19, the economy - on screen, newspapers and social media, but I don’t see much attention given to class issues."
19733,There’s been far too many foreign worker deaths recently.
19734,"There’s no money left to hire maids, at least not for a long time."
19735,"There’s no such thing as an off duty migrant worker, we should stop expecting them to retrieve our stuff or save a cat on a tree."
19736,There’s not many countries in the world where you can even bring in FDWs on a legal work visa.
19737,It’s substantially more expensive than FDWs in Singapore.
19738,Imagine if FDWs cost 4-5 times the current market rate (minimum wage in Japan/Korea/US/EU).
19739,"How about if no work visa is given for FDWs, who is going to be working in these roles?"
19740,"There’s not many developed countries in the world where you can even hire a maid, unless you’re exceptionally rich, and are part of the top 1%."
19741,"Can you imagine living in Switzerland, for example, and telling the locals that you cannot live without hiring maids?"
19742,A live in maid in Switzerland will probably cost at least S$5000 a month.
19743,There’s racism everywhere.
19744,You should hear the racist shit my Indian friends say about their own people who are of a different class or skin darker colour.
19745,You should hear the racist comments my asian friends talk about black people.
19746,You should hear the racist comments my black friends say about white and Asian people.
19747,I’ve gotta say I’ve never experienced any racism or marginalization from the Malay or Indian communities here though.
19748,In my opinion all that matters is:  - Current Job Details (confirm they have steady job and income) - Income details (confirm they can afford rent) - Credit check (confirm they have reliable credit history) - References from previous landlords (confirm they have been good tenants in previous properties)   Adding race requirements is simply racist and no amount of excuses will get around that fact
19749,These are same to people to spit on immigrant workers in Singapore who built the skyscrapers and homes.
19750,These people probably can’t iron a shirt or wash a dish but expect the maid to perform like a professional butler... they expect the floor to be spotless!
19751,Sure there will be maids who are dishonest etc but why treat every maid as if she has bad intentions?
19752,"And the SG mentality that if you pay someone for their service, you have to wring out every cent from them, like making the maid work 12 hour days, limiting their food whilst gorging themselves at the hawker center and complaining about food prices."
19753,"These are truly the foreign talents that we so desperately need in Singapore, especially with the labour shortage and border closure restrictions."
19754,These cancerous racist comments makes me wanna just poke my both eyes.
19755,Fucking racist sia cb they all.
19756,What do you earn from making a racist comment?
19757,Sorry if i rant too much but yeah i don't tolerate racism at all.
19758,These expats who are given expat packages have been sent by their company from their home country to take up a temporary posting in Singapore.
19759,"""Expatriate"" as a verb means to send overseas; the company expatriated the employee."
19760,"There's a whole bunch of other foreigners that we refer to as ""expats"" even if they looked for a job here rather than being posted here by their home country."
19761,"But this particular study on ""expat pay packages"" refers to a smallish fraction of EPs here."
19762,These foreign workers ARE second-class residents.
19763,"It is likely that an outbreak at a shopping centre popular with foreign workers (as well as travelers and locals) ""seeded"" the virus in many dorms."
19764,These foreign workers are prob more buff than average Singaporeans lol
19765,"These foreign workers were born into abject poverty, in a country that truly does not care if they, or their families, live or die."
19766,"These modest immigrant children excel in spite of the circumstances, not because of it."
19767,"These ones need no proof, they revel in their racist bullshit"
19768,"These people are sure quiet regarding how foreign workers,are treated here."
19769,These people talk like the foreign workers doesn't benefit.
19770,Or reliance on foreign workers have lifted more of them out of poverty than they ever would have a chance if the opportunity to work here did not presented itself  These professors talking up their backside seriously need to get out of their books and go see the world  Over traveled worked and in some cases lived in many of these countries.
19771,These posters are amazingly funny and racist.
19772,No VTL as of yet can mean many things.
19773,"UAE doesn't want to do a VTL with us, MFA hasn't spoken to UAE, etc."
19774,"I'm a migrant worker as well, and can sympathize with those worrying about the situation in their home country."
19775,"You can't really compare the usual maid-related murder - non-premeditated, on the spur of the moment and brought on by ill-treatment or mental health issues - to something like Jabing's in the first place because the circumstances are way different."
19776,Unless the maid got drunk and deliberately killed the employers with the motive of stealing their money.
19777,"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/measures-put-in-place-at-westlite-woodlands-dormitory-covid-19-14672690  > The ministry, together with an expert panel comprising infectious diseases and microbiology experts, are investigating if the workers have been re-infected, or if they are “persistent shedders” from their earlier infections."
19778,(https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2020/01/30/racism-rears-its-ugly-head-as-coronavirus-fear-grips-world)
19779,They already said they will honor the VTL that have been sold   I know things can be hard to predict but I’m quite sure that’s a drastic move unlikely to happen  In any case !remindme in 2 weeks
19780,They always get the last laugh when they shit in your food and feed it to you /s   Ps is there a less dehumanising word the FDW ???
19781,It's pure racism.
19782,My maid does so on her days off.
19783,"We can develop a closer relationship as time goes on, but not everyone can be buddy-buddy with their maid."
19784,It is also important to remember that there are terrible maids as well.
19785,Not every maid is some docile saint.
19786,"There are shitty employers, but there are also shitty maids."
19787,They are doing the exact opposite in regards to expats getting EP renewals.
19788,Plenty of expats voting with their feet and just as many being forced to use their feet with EP denials and abolishing LOC’s forcing thousands of trailing spouses out of the workplace.
19789,I know many expats in hiring positions trying to fill jobs but cannot find suitable candidates locally and are denied approval for EP’s.
19790,"They are entitled to one day off per week, but in practice many maids actually opt to forgo the off day for extra pay."
19791,"](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/Hundreds-of-Sinovac-injected-Indonesian-doctors-contract-COVID) China like to keep parading that people are politicising vaccines, while they themselves kept telling people to use their vaccines or they are racist."
19792,I agree that segregation of migrant workers is a problem but we can’t move forward if every solution is critiqued for its imperfections.
19793,"As I said, you might bicker with the male skew of the sample, but at best you can say is that the male skew is distorting the results because Chinese men are more racist."
19794,So perhaps the university they went was particularly racist for some reason ?
19795,"If they were wearing masks properly and still got harassed/attacked/scolded, then it's more likely to be racism."
19796,"And when they have problem with dwindling population they turn to robots and automation, not foreign talent."
19797,You usually don't hear Aussie expats 'bitching' about this.
19798,"And lmao what you talking about, Americans are always hating on immigrants my dude."
19799,They are tightening everything from employment pass to Citizenship Application.
19800,I think the easiest pass is work permit for domestic workers (maids).
19801,They are unhappy about sending the migrant workers to offshore dorms.
19802,"They aren't the most exciting places, especially for expats, but you can find places matching your budget (splitting an apartment/condo with others) out west towards Queenstown/Alexandra."
19803,"If you mean foreign workers in fields like construction and domestic work, then I think their working conditions are pretty bad."
19804,Why does he want to come here despite all the xenophobia?
19805,They can apply for political asylum.
19806,They can but employer has already paid monies upfront to employ the maid through the agency.
19807,Yes the funds can be used to rotate and find another maid through agency to work for you but employer still has to bear costs of having original maid leaving sg such as airfare and the govt fine.
19808,They can only use VTLs if vaccinated fully or they can take the non VTL flight and have to undergo quarantine upon arrival
19809,They can refuse to do business with racist land lords.
19810,"They can't even leave the rooms most of the time to visit the stores within the dormitory complex (in many dormitories, not all so don't POMFA me please)."
19811,I don't see the rationale for not allowing them to at least be free within the dormitory complex.
19812,Singapore treatment of foreign workers is already much better than many other countries.
19813,"Assuming they work from Monday to Saturday, most of their time would be spent in the field and not the dormitory."
19814,I've seen foreign workers in punggol fishing and sitting down by the beach having a picnic.
19815,It's just that Indians don't tend to be racist towards themselves.
19816,"They chose to give birth, and they are affluent enough to afford hiring domestic helpers."
19817,"It's funny how we're in a situation where you need to hire 2 or more locals in order to fulfill quota to hire 1 foreign worker to be cleaner, labourer, etc while you can filled an entire office with EP workers as long as you post 2months job ad on approved websites and claim inability to find suitable local candidates."
19818,These migrant workers aren't viewed like that.
19819,"Half of the racist shit you see originates there, it’s the singaporean Stormfront"
19820,They did highlight how foreign workers are happy to be taking up these jobs in Singapore as it means higher pay than at home.
19821,"However, their criticism was more on Singapore's obsession on efficiency and value which triggers an undesirable trend of poor treatment to foreign workers as their value to some Singaporeans seems to be ""low"" and that gives some an excuse to treat them accordingly, to maintain cost efficiency that Singapore excels in today."
19822,Raising public awareness that there are people screaming racist nonsense at minorities and beating them does not make you a criminal.
19823,They do count for VTL
19824,"""Am I treating my maid too well for giving her 8 hours of rest?"""
19825,So I woke my maid up to wash it.
19826,"I ask my maid to hand wash.""   ""I tell my maid wifi is signed by my husband's company, so cannot share with her."""
19827,"""I don't let my maid have a phone."
19828,"They don't even want to say sorry to Singaporeans for lying to us that we should not wear masks back in February and March, so what makes you think they will apologize to foreign workers?"
19829,"But if for example, expat family doesn’t wear masks, don’t think SG Encik was wrong to fk them for it  (Just that he did go abit over the top)"
19830,Horrible horrible racism.
19831,They had a strong mandate and bungled the COVID response when it comes to our migrant workers.
19832,"They have finally realized the stupidity of this and have effectively extended to VTL to all 27 EEA countries in Europe now:   >But from March 16, travellers who have been in any country in the EEA within the last seven days prior to departure for Singapore will be allowed to enter under the VTL."
19833,You should verify whether the maid forged any details or signatures from the family
19834,"They speak English, but speak Tagalog more when among themselves, like Singaporeans and their mother tongues."
19835,Why make racist and derogatory remarks about people that are looking for a better life?
19836,"They have to have been in a VTL country for the last 15 days or so, which is plenty of time for symptoms to show up/PCR to test positive."
19837,"And usually maids, they are desperate to be able to send money back to their family because of how much valuable Singapore dollar is after converting to Indonesian rupiah."
19838,"Because of this,  I can assure you this isn't the first maid abuse nor will it be the last."
19839,"The maid needs that money for her family back home so she endure, hoping that this is a phrase or that things will get better."
19840,This cycle continue until someone sound it off or the maid dies.
19841,"They’re wealthy people of standing in the community, why should they go down because their maid is unhappy with being exploited?"
19842,The maid has their employment pass and/or a photocopy of the passport I believe.
19843,In case the maid runs away.
19844,They kena called racist leh.
19845,They apologized for using their IP without permission but definitely can't do the same about the racist allegation.
19846,Like that people will say they're admitting they're racist leh.
19847,Air France  KLM  Lufthansa  British Airways  Swiss Air  To name a few operate VTL's?
19848,"I imagine there are some requirements that need to be met, but beyond that there are non-SQ options for most VTL countries."
19849,"Worth much more than a thanks on reddit would be locals standing up to this toxic, xenophobic behavior on Facebook, to tell those uncles, aunties and bots to go fuck themselves."
19850,They probably think that because it's public housing it must shit especially if they never stepped out of the expat bubble
19851,"They probably won't get any money and your friend will probably get blacklisted by the maid agency,  but she can go work for you in Canada with your diamond hands and large toilets😊"
19852,The only diff is that 12-39age group has 2-3 weeks delays for expats who are not in prioritised vocation.
19853,"They should have hired more maids, but they want to be stingy."
19854,Most maids with similar salaries only work in a single floor house like HDB flats.
19855,Are they paying this maid 4x the market rate to do 4x the work?
19856,"Its the maid who wanted to quit, why is the employer suffering for it?"
19857,They should just move fast and remove VTL now.
19858,There are open borders in the EU and bordering countries that are not VTL.
19859,"They should remove the stupid VTL altogether and just impose travel bans on ""unsafe"" countries"
19860,"They should seriously consider having VTLs with closer neighbouring countries like Msia, Indonesia."
19861,Even now you try and condone your racism... unattended kids running into the road is not a cultural difference 🤦‍♂️ commiting crime is also not a cultural difference ...  What we are witnessing right now is a person who doesnt understand their own ignorance and is just blaming everything on local vs FT. Take accountability for once and look at your own flaws please.
19862,"You made a number of generalisations and baseless claims on taxi assaults etc for which you cannot even back up   Again, people like YOU are part of why there is racism and xenophobia in the country."
19863,They started FDW but this country stability is supported by two of the under appreciated pillars.
19864,"Just imagine one day, all helpers & foreign workers stopped working."
19865,They target CECA as customer base.
19866,They teach it in mother tongue.
19867,"Which for many kids who speak English at home, is largely incomprehensible because they don’t know the mother tongue vocabulary for abstract concepts and emotions in lower primary."
19868,They tweak the rules constantly to reduce/increase the flow of immigrants.
19869,Just saying 'Two Chinese Women' is nothing but a racist dogwhistle.
19870,The VTL is a reciprocal agreement.
19871,"For Germany, if you read the milelion article, it's possible to not use the VTL route and instead visit it normally, but do a 7 day SHN upon returning because it's in Cat 2."
19872,"While the problem has been around for decades, don't think it's inaccurate to say that producing a documentary on racism in Singapore in 2016 broadcast in Mediacorp was fairly groundbreaking stuff."
19873,You have no idea how difficult and expensive it is to bring a new maid in from another country.
19874,"Now all of them are being vilified because some idiots who know exactly how FTAs work are acting like they don't making it appear that the FTA is the reason for unrelated problems, and imo, knowingly fanning the flames of racism and xenophobia in the process."
19875,Most non-Chinese/Indian/Malay immigrants I knew took Mandarin anyway.
19876,"They might also be allowed to take a non-mother tongue language like French or German*, on a case by case basis  *Outside of school"
19877,"They're expats, not immigrants."
19878,There's a limited number of senior management openings for expats to occupy and you can't just shepherd more of them into Singapore.
19879,They're going to bend over backward to try to justify why this isn't about the dreaded Ah Pu Neh Neh and that they're totes not racist.
19880,"They're not risking their lives, they're risking their maid's life which is below their own for some reason."
19881,"They're only ""racist"" online, and by online I mean gaming."
19882,"They'll find any means to insult you, from ""your mother"" to ""banglah dog"", it doesn't matter what skin colour you are, people are just inheritly angsty here(mainly teens)  They will never be racist in front of you, but at the back probably."
19883,Most of the maid cafes are pop up stores now with AFA and other events.
19884,She left before the new maid came
19885,Same story here and CECA just happens to be the lightning rod.
19886,I'm sure they can do the same for these immigrant-conscripts.
19887,">	Under Phase One of post-Circuit Breaker, FDWs must continue to stay at home during their rest days."
19888,This was communicated to employers and FDWs in the https://mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-fdw-stay-home-on-rest-day issued on 21 May.
19889,"Thing is, I don’t doubt that there are specific industries that are mostly dominated by foreign workers."
19890,"In another incident, an ST at another camp I visited in civilian wear muttered ""fking CECA"" when I was scanning my items at the X Ray machine, and glared at me when I asked what he meant by that."
19891,"It has no longer become a case of foreign vs local Indians, or the inability of differentiating between expats and locals."
19892,"It is a definitely turbulent time in the world right now, but hopefully if we work together as a community in Singapore, we can overcome both the virus and minimise the growing racism/xenophobic sentiment in SG."
19893,"Thing is, racists usually don’t think they are racists... there’s a 101 justifications for why they think XYZ is “just like that one loh” and don’t recognize that lumping the whole race into a stereotype like this is the core of how racism starts."
19894,To say that creating better conditions for foreign workers will result in significant higher prices is somewhat myopic.
19895,Think I will create 2 separate comment post to   1: answer your question   2:give my own perception of why such perception exist among those who are discontented with foreign worker policy  *To answer your question*  There are lots of community groups out in the public you can volunteer your time to.
19896,Having children in Singapore is not cheap for expats unless they send them to local schools… and very few do
19897,Think he's talking more about PRC immigrants.
19898,Think mood is more down because the main outbreak is in our community vs last year's dormitory outbreak.
19899,Not so much that their preferences are for expats.
19900,Don't make up some lame a** excuse about expats after asking about partner's race etc.
19901,https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-replies/2012/ministry-checking-on-maid-who-drove-for-employer
19902,Thanks for bringing this up because racism and xenophobia are pretty related imv.
19903,Thinking of chionging to book VTL flights when they’re released in December.
19904,Thinly-veiled racist comments then?
19905,"Again, what's racist to Reddit/this sub's mods/me/you will diverge."
19906,"Third option: if you're in Singapore but on EP etc, for non-VTL you'll need to get your company to apply for an entry permit on your behalf."
19907,"Thiruben wrote in his post:  >""Whether you are part of the minority or the majority, Singaporean or immigrant, I hope that our story has empowered you to stand up against those who constantly try to put you in a box."
19908,Asking these citizens/PRs if perceive themselves to be better (less racist) in comparison to their newer counter-parts is kinda counter-intuitive and rhetorical.
19909,"This 2k is for covid fees and quarantine, because the maid got covid."
19910,Straight up illegal to claim this from the maid.
19911,Also you are not allowed to physically prevent the maid from leaving no matter what she owes you.
19912,"You can sue the maid if you want, but you cannot keep them hostage."
19913,Maybe some would feel there are racist undertones.
19914,"I am not sure if this arose from systematic racism ( i dun get to mix with other races often and understand them)  or casual racism (aiyah, malay wear nice clothes, hari raya lar, what else) or both."
19915,"However, to bring in how racist everything or everyone is, to PA... this might not be just solely PA to address or work on."
19916,"See, we not racist"" ..."
19917,Which doesnt solve the inherent racism issues...
19918,"This is still very much racism, or rather the effects that tons of race-based policies, interactions and behaviours that create a clear distinction between 'race', and thus separate and divide people based on this 'distinction'."
19919,"But even then, adding on to the issue of 'race', there's still xenophobia and class struggles that could play a hand that creates violence (*not necessarily physical violence, but in this case yes*), and could explain violence even if those involved are of the same 'race' or not (*which is a bit reductive as race is a social construct based on 'catch-all' categories, which may ignore differences WITHIN race*)."
19920,"When most depictions in media, popular or social, don't capture migrant workers as people caught in a cycle of international labour movements, they either get framed as simply disposable and not worth our time (*for low-wage workers*) or as cheats and steals that take away the ""good jobs"" from Singaporeans (*for high-wage workers*)."
19921,"This is an attack that is not just racist, but embedded in lots of other identity politics here in Singapore, where stereotypes and caricatures replace empathy and personality."
19922,"Just fyi, you can be put on the MoM blacklist for MUCH LESS than abusing your maid."
19923,Just for something like bringing your maid to clean your brother's apartment (for example) can lead to warnings and eventual blacklisting.
19924,As in you will never be able to hire a maid again.
19925,Another super common offence that nobody seems to know about is that technically you're not supposed to have your maid clean your car.
19926,"This always mentioned, but you need to factor that al least in middle management positions and above the expat will requesr higher salary as the cost of living in SG is higher forvan expat family"
19927,I rmb the 10pm washing which the employer was shocked she was mistreating her maid.
19928,She was noted giving her maid 10 pm to sleep IF she finished her work by then.
19929,"The whole xenophobia just stinks of, if I can't have it, then I want to see the world burn."
19930,"Also, she's painting all foreign workers with the same brush based on that one data point from her friend who rented out their apartment?"
19931,"While there is no excuse for us not to improve on the housing situation of the migrant workers, trying to guilt trip the population with fairy tales isn't the way to go either."
19932,Most of the migrant workers comes from more rural areas of Bangladesh and India.
19933,This article itself is pretty racist
19934,"If your point is to argue that Singapore is not meritocratic in part due to institutionalized racism, how does eugenics and housing quota relate?"
19935,This bears out my comment on another thread that racism is still bubbling under the surface in Singapore and we're better off acknowledging it so we can fight it.
19936,Worse if he's just being blatantly racist and no one called him out on it.
19937,"If the doc instructs the maid to work less, would she translate this accurately  2."
19938,This cibai josephine teo really got some serious attitude problem...  like as if the migrant workers would dare to ask for an apology (unless they heck care anymore)  together with her past comments i really wonder how this dumb fark even managed to graduate from university in the first place
19939,"If I remember correctly, there is no limit to the number of employment pass holders they can have, but the number of S pass holders is capped 25% of total employees."
19940,"PMET jobs Indians are 2nd highest because of global population share and proximity, and because we don't 'see' Chinese PMETs as immigrants on the surface."
19941,Spouses of all EP holders were allowed to work until May - nothing specific to CECA - and now they are all disallowed.
19942,"Chairman Liew’s contribution to Singapore is one matter, how he and his household treated his former maid is another matter."
19943,This comment section is basically protecting racist ideals.. eg.
19944,He is the racist one in this whole debacle.
19945,Should migrant workers be treated differently?
19946,I don't believe SBS is willing to pay extra levy upon wages just to be 'racist' towards non-singaporeans.
19947,"People seems only mind their own business, no funny stare from stranger, only occasionally deathly stare  Work is hard, but the pay is better compare to other countries  Im chinese, so the less racism  I don't mind see ahbeng try to enjoy themselves in public with all their shithousery."
19948,People when put in these situations tend to just generally label groups and races which just is racist and xenophobic.
19949,There's an unnecessary divide between the treatment of expats and FDWs.
19950,"This does not only apply to domestic helpers, small businesses do this to some of their foreign staff as a method of control to ensure they dont run away without informing the company since the company is holding onto some of their money as ""insurance""."
19951,"Some of the vocal anti-mmtf accounts here seems to be owned by expats who can't vote, people planning to leave Singapore or people who already left Singapore but just like to come here to complain"
19952,"This doesn't happen often, but one time colleagues were indulging in dumb stereotypes about Indians (I'm Indian btw) and I managed to pivot the conversation around to a Caucasian manager who was recently short with them (they had told a related story that the manager was racist)  The instant comparison shut them up lol  I still think about that moment a lot, it's my crowning achievement"
19953,On top of their pay they would also have to pay foreign worker levy which is quite a lot.
19954,This doesn’t just apply to maids but to a large number of foreign workers though.
19955,This isn’t an employment contract issue so much as an issue of how many of the families hiring maids think they own them.
19956,And it’s this exact attitude that continues to perpetuate casual racism and ostracism.
19957,This domestic helper was just dumb honestly.
19958,Now because of her all future domestic helpers will be treated more harshly by this employer.
19959,"This dude keeps touting vaccine nationalism - ironically, as expats in Singapore under the age of 39 cannot get vaccines, and Singapore is the only developed country in the world to have such a policy to my knowledge"
19960,"If you wanna talk about foreign workers depressing local wages, showing for the example a Malaysian with little to no work experience and a second-rate private degree being able to get an EP at a salary level *below* the official EP threshold (not to mention local grad salaries) would be greater cause for concern than this example."
19961,"This feels like the equivalent of ""I've made a insensitive mistake, but I'm not racist because I hang out with my Malay and Indian friends""  Racism is a spectrum."
19962,"On one hand, you can have people who lash at minorities in public for dating someone outside of his race, and on the other hand, you can also have people who make off-handed careless remarks like ""woah your English is quite good for a Chinese / malay / Indian""  With this, it's not difficult to imagine why cultural insensitivities, stereotypes or caricature (ie using a wedding photo to represent a totally different festival) can feel like racism the minorities"
19963,"Why are most of the people here talking about their own ‘sufferings’, like as though wearing masks everywhere is more painful than whatever our migrant workers are experiencing?"
19964,I fully advocate a relationship of mutual trust and respect between maids and employers.
19965,"But it is also important to note that just as there are bad employers, there are also bad maids and bad agencies out there."
19966,My Friend had a maid who told them a sob story of how the family needed money for expenses and health issues.
19967,This dude is the definition of foreign talent.
19968,"Imagine how crushing it is to eat that racist ""not ready for non-Chinese PM"" shit for breakfast, and then come out and have to say something like this?"
19969,This guy tanks all the racism for us
19970,"This happened to someone I know, maid had a secret boyfriend, a bangla construction worker, and she got pregnant."
19971,"Anyway, it's the racist landlord's loss."
19972,"Retreating into racism and elitism is our upraised, dripping brown middle finger at the Pledge and at Singapore."
19973,"There are people from traditional chinese families who are nice and not racist, and then there's those that are."
19974,"This has nothing to do with xenophobia, straight up attitude problem most of you CECA have..  To the good ones, I'm sorry that the arrogant piece of shit are giving bad image to the indians coming over here to work."
19975,This ill treatment of migrant workers is terrible but are you really going to compare this to slavery in 1800s America or the Arab slave trade...
19976,"This is XTREME racism; nothing more, nothing less"
19977,This is a bunch of crap... help your maid open an account and even offer to help them learn to manage their money.
19978,"When I lived in SG and had a maid, I told her she would get a $50 sgd bonus to stay with us until we moved back to the US, even if that extended beyond the end of her contract (requiring a contract renewal), but that is much different than holding her whole salary."
19979,Fortunately our maid had been in SG for 8 years and was very smart and good with her money.
19980,This is a deeply racist country that tries to hide behind the rhetoric of racial harmony.
19981,This is a fair point if you’re worried about salary depression from foreign workers.
19982,"We should bait these racists into saying something unquestionably racist, record it and take them to tasks."
19983,"So ironic that the article is titled ""racism is not the answer..."" but ends up blaming Chinese Singaporeans for seemingly every bad thing that happened to migrant workers lol."
19984,"This is a great explanation and actually fairly in line with the government's rhetoric: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-09/singapore-seeks-middle-path-on-covid-reopening-ong-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-09/singapore-seeks-middle-path-on-covid-reopening-ong-says)  Unfortunately, we are still very far away from the immunity numbers for ""peer"" countries like Denmark and Germany\*, especially when you consider that the past infections mostly occurred in the migrant worker community, not within the network of folks that are currently mixing around."
19985,This is a great thread unlike some SJW thread some people start just to begin hating on the 'inherently' racist country we live in.
19986,"Again, you comment reeks of generalisation with hints of classism and racism."
19987,We have a racism problem guys.
19988,"This is a lot of words to say ""racism is fine as long as it doesn't affect me""."
19989,This is a painfully true experience that I have seen many expat (typically those are not pigmentally challenged) friends and colleagues suffer similar stories.
19990,And is not racist.
19991,"If it is the former, then you're not racist."
19992,Using race as a proxy to assess what characteristics or traits an individual has is racist.
19993,"And yes, a LOT of people are racist - on a global level I would say maybe more than half the population is."
19994,I think our govt doesn’t really know HOW to explain it delicately to the populace without whipping up xenophobia and a public overreaction...and furthermore most of our population doesn’t take much of an interest in foreign policy.
19995,"1) you sound like you have zero idea what to do with your life, so why are you complaining about foreign talents graduating earlier when you don't even know what your goal is?"
19996,If you are willing to justify and empathize with racists you are not much better than them.
19997,This is a thread about racism in Singapore.
19998,"During British colonialism, Chinese-medium schools were started by immigrants to Singapore who were disenfranchised by English-medium schools run by the colonial government and Christian religious societies."
19999,"You see this divide even now, with schools like RI started by the colonial government and ACS started by the Methodist Church, while schools like HCI were started by Chinese immigrants."
20000,This is a very heart-warming worker-employee relationship perhaps all people with maids could learn from.
20001,This is absolutely abuse of racism.
20002,HDB EIP is just commercial issue but not racism.
20003,"If kids and guests, who don't pay any money to the condos, can use the facilities, then why can't maids?"
20004,"I clearly have seen unpopular opinion by others that are not racist in nature nor bigoted, but got downvoted."
20005,Especially the last point about the relationship between Malay Muslims' religious education and Malays' general command of their mother tongue.
20006,"But thinking about it logically, most of them act in that racist way but truth is they will just move on with their daily lives and won't even remember that their president isn't Chinese as well."
20007,"Whether you are PRC Chinese or not, Indians, Koreans, South East Asians etc do not matter to racists."
20008,This is already in place: was only hired on the basis of my language skills (mother tongue Danish).
20009,Many of the current positions at my work are offered to local Singaporeans as a requirement - and if foreign hired the company has to prove why the expat is hired over local.
20010,"As a brown, English-speaking Indian Singaporean, I faced daily racism from the very first day of school."
20011,Singapore thrives on expat contribution in terms of expertise and knowledge and compliments Singaporeans already well known work ethos and desire to learn from others.
20012,Do people really think the quality is going to be better for foreign workers with less agency and whose meals cost far less?
20013,2 people I know caught COVID-19 whilst traveling under VTL.
20014,This is by far the best (and most succinct) explanation of why that letter is xenophobic and racist!
20015,"Everyone who disagrees with their view is “alt-right, racist, and sexist”."
20016,The empty plot of land in used in cck grove was far enough away from residential areas to house migrant workers.
20017,They are quite racist and society gives them a pass because they are old and the younger generation is conditioned to be used to it.
20018,Source: Asian American with parents and grandparents are quite racist (with justifiable life experiences for this racism)
20019,"This is conclusive that VTL is not health and safety based, or even on citizen's demand, but diplomacy and politics"
20020,A domestic helper would then not be able to assist in bringing children outdoors or handle marketing.
20021,This is exactly the reason why I’m extra nice to domestic helpers when i visit other people’s houses.
20022,"When it comes to a total stranger as in a maid, I prefer not to choose blind faith."
20023,This poor maid died with injuries that even the hardest MMA fighters won't accumulate in their careers.
20024,"Honestly, the only punishment that can provide justice to the poor maid is if Gaiyathiri Murugayan receives a stroke of the cane daily till she dies, and maybe that won't even be enough."
20025,This is torture and to say she didn't know it may kill the maid would be some mental gymnastics.
20026,"She probably didn't want to kill the maid though, killing her would mean the maid wouldn't be alive for her to continue her torture."
20027,This is fricking absurd when an organization has their employees being harassed on race they shouldn't equivocate and try to claim that maybe the racists harassing people online have a point or try and disprove their claim.
20028,"It’s damn insulting, and probably the most racist part of the entire clip."
20029,"This is funny because this is only true on surface level and hotline bling is really fun song just on the surface level too so the meme is just poking fun of casual racism, the same as the song is poking fun at casual sex."
20030,Her friend’s comment about Coronavirus was racist though.
20031,The way the woman (@beforeik.o) who publicised the “racist” post and the many other Singaporeans who flamed her and spoke about educating the uneducated about cultural appropriation have crossed so many lines.
20032,The funniest thing to me about all of this is that there are so many youngsters claiming to educate others about racism and defending Chinese culture when they barely know anything about Chinese culture to begin with.
20033,"Furthermore, as Singaporean Chinese,—especially for those who have never experienced being a minority in a country—we should be the last to even make comments about racism."
20034,I have Indian and Malay friends who receive casual racist remarks now and then from Chinese.
20035,"Yea, one may not mean those remarks, but it’s still racism, isn’t it?"
20036,"No one even pays attention to the racism the minorities in Singapore are facing on a daily basis, no matter how casual."
20037,Not because racism doesn’t exist.
20038,I’m so scared for the day my lil sis has to go to primary school cuz surprisingly young parents and young kids are the most racist people I have ever seen.
20039,"Most of them are from countries that don't really use maids as widely as Singaporeans, much less reading about such abuse.."
20040,This is in contrast to the maid who filmed the old man naked in the shower.
20041,"47 per cent of migrant workers in S'pore dorms have had a Covid-19 infection, say Manpower and Health Ministries https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/47-per-cent-of-migrant-workers-in-dorms-have-had-a-covid-19-infection-say-manpower-and"
20042,"Singapore, please learn from your mistake with the foreign workers and be KINDER to the less fortunate."
20043,The government should be grabbing that opportunity to displace Hong Kong with both hands - loosening travel restrictions are a clear sign of that.
20044,This is just asking landlords to be more covert with their racism lol.
20045,The racism battle can really be fought on a different battlefield where the thing at stake is not a property that takes decades of work to afford.
20046,This is just racist.
20047,I suspect the reluctance of enforcing quota on employment pass is due to the fact that our glc is heavily invested in certain country.
20048,In my opinion both Mahathir and LKY were racist in this scenario.
20049,Recently read another post from one dormitory worker.
20050,"Or maybe they know that it's racist, that the insult will hurt that much more, that's why they said it?"
20051,"I have long said that Chinese people are not racist, we are just horrible people... Period."
20052,This is like saying the US shouldn't export their work to China because they work in (gasp) such horrible conditions and that the jobs should be given to a mix of locals and immigrants in the US instead.
20053,"The real effect of this actually, is that desperate low income migrant workers will have a loss of crucial income , and Singaporean industries will have a loss of affordable labour."
20054,"It's crazy how the family (including the maid) is being financially punished for this shit while in most other developed nations, medical debt really isn't a problem."
20055,I don't believe for a minute that the employers are so worried about how the maid spends her money.
20056,"The point is that ""we're day to day dissatisfied"" doesnt automatically mean ""so getting rid of CECA will solve it""."
20057,"I don't support PAP being out of touch as all hell and invalidating everything from minimum wage to immigration policy, I need to make that super clear because people want to vent about that."
20058,"The EPL attract foreign talents all over the world, with foreign players making up to 60% of players, and 4 out of 5 Chelsea players are foreign players."
20059,"This is my summary of the various passes in Singapore, based on MOM's [website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits)  - Work permit - for semi-skilled foreign workers (construction, manufacturing, marine shipyard, process or services sector), confinement nannies and domestic workers."
20060,"It's high time all estates share the responsibility for the migrant workers' housing, be it temporary or permanent."
20061,"I don't think it's racism, it just is the way people work."
20062,"Wherever it is, there will  be some individuals of the majority race trying to establish their superiority.I'm Indian and let me tell you .. Indian's can be equally if not more, racist and even towards fellow Indians."
20063,"The truth is, Singapore has more money and resources than other countries like Dubai and Malaysia that also have similar policies for foreign workers."
20064,Would it hurt for Singapore to become better for foreign workers?
20065,"Even if a chinese or Malay did the same thing, it’s not automatically racist unless the person does hold similar feelings towards all just because of the colour of their skin rather than their nationality."
20066,"Either Singapore will emerge victorious and be independent of foreign talents and investments, which is great or Singaporeans will leave to be foreign workers in other countries."
20067,This is an old post but you can follow the discussion here to see how it works:  https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewtopic.php?t=99243
20068,This is not racism.
20069,"The place is a cess pool of xenophobia, racism, homophobia and misogyny."
20070,This is obvious racism from a Chinese.
20071,This is one of the things that really bugs me about how FDWs are treated here in Singapore.
20072,"This is only for the land VTL, which only had a pre-departure test requirement previously."
20073,Both pre-departure PCR/ART and on-arrival PCR tests are needed for air VTLs.
20074,I think now it’s not the time to blame but I hope that majority of the people’s mindset change on FWs and maids too.
20075,"To be eligible for VTL, one must only transit at VTL countries."
20076,"For non-VTL flights, you may transit at Cat 3 and 4 countries to be counted as Cat 2 as long as your travel history (excluding transits) are in Cat 1/2 countries."
20077,Hence it is unlikely that there are a large number of non migrant workers who contract covid 19 but never report /are asymptomatic.
20078,"This is peak entitlement right here and I say this with my family being ""expats"" in Singapore."
20079,Singaporeans don't even want to live near migrant worker dorms (remember Seangoon Gardens?)
20080,"and extending a path to citizenship to South Asian migrant workers, who arguably form the most discriminated segment of the population, will easily cost the PAP another a GRC or two."
20081,"Clearly, Singapore already has a legal definition for racism, given that it is illegal, and this definition was probably based off of British colonial laws, not created by the Chinese (the current majority)."
20082,"If there is some redefinition of racism in Singapore (which to me is unlikely), I think it's premature to assert that this will be defined by the majority."
20083,"He likely cannot get an employment pass, and even if he can, he would risk getting refused when applying for subsequent passes."
20084,Hopefully this will encourage more Chinese to speak out against racism here.
20085,This is precisely why I don't get people who abuse and mistreats maids.
20086,"From our ethnic policies based on clearly defined races, to framing racist attacks as ""attacks on communities""."
20087,"I was being sarcastic, I'm not actually conceding that I am a racist, I'm just showing you that it is him, not me, who is being self-righteous because you clearly don't understand the meaning of the word."
20088,Now being a racist doesn't automatically make one self-righteous but that's irrelevant because I am NOT one.
20089,"I find Cantonese sounds bad, does that make me a racist against my own race?"
20090,This is racist please delete this comment.
20091,"This is racist, how ironic"
20092,"These migrant workers face so much casual and even active racism from the locals, and that has only worsened in the era of COVID."
20093,"This is really so shitty, why are people getting more racist?"
20094,"And like even if you have racist views, why the fuck not keep it to yourself and let your toxicity die down with you eventually."
20095,"They need revenue for their poor management of covid, which results in thousands and thousands of women looking for money as a maid overseas."
20096,This is slightly racist but foreign Indian families are a whole other level when it comes to treating helpers/service staff badly.
20097,So if you’re on a working visa: - no more work travel pass lane approval needed - no more VTL approval needed - you just follow the entry requirements based on which country you are traveling from?
20098,"As someone who have lived in multiple countries, and who studies racial and statistical discrimination,  such racism in renting is rampant everywhere."
20099,"Just because it's stated outright does not mean that the place is indeed ""more racist""."
20100,We like to parade ourselves as a multinational metropolis of acceptance and diversity but deep down we are plagued with the same callous racists which have caused so much disarray and pain around the world in other counties.
20101,This is so tone deaf and racist / classist...
20102,"Even if like you said it’s not racism, it absolutely is a form of discrimination especially in professional environments"
20103,If everything is racist then nothing is.
20104,"This is spot on, in the UK you might face more displays of overt racism but it's not super common."
20105,In SG you will hardly face overt racism but subtle racism is present DAILY.
20106,Most Singaporeans would have more sympathy for Korean/Japanese expats than their own minority countrymen.

20137,Don't think I got the monies capability to tank the VTL costs together with ticket prices for concerts overseas so I'll have to lan lan suck thumb lo
20138,Therefore no Indians = not racism.
20139,This is the most racist shit I’ve ever read.
20140,"The important thing is, I will always think of the workers and the maids as humans first."
20141,"This is the real problem, not CECA."
20142,I am writing to you today because I am concerned about the the road safety requirements in place for transporting workers in the back of lorries and trucks on public roads.
20143,"""*You say we should limit foreign talent ah?"
20144,Shame on you asking us to limit ALL foreign talent!
20145,Then leave the meeting go for tea and then go home and hang out with other expats friends.
20146,This is the type of mentality people use to justify their treatment of maids.
20147,The treatment of maids and laborers in Singapore and the Middle East is basically modern day slavery.
20148,"In short, and if OP wants to google, my unsourced opinion is that the Little India riots were an example of migrant worker discontent with their living arrangements, and most people recognised that."
20149,"Having said that, racism is still an individual choice and regardless of whether the government has helped the situation or not, racist people being racist is all on them, wouldn't let them off with easy justifications like 'oh it's the gahmen fault one'."
20150,I have a strong feeling that this case happened because of the influx of newer Indian foreign talent who are less integrated into the Singaporean identity.
20151,"For border measures, the wording from their English version of their foreign affairs website leaves a large ambiguity: https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m\_2435/view.do?seq=761362"
20152,This is turning into a country wide scandal on the treatment of migrant workers right now.
20153,Say you paid agency A to find you the FDW.
20154,"They find u the FDW, and give you a six month guarantee of free transfer."
20155,"After six months is up, they tell your FDW, hey, we have an offer from another employer B for higher salary for you."
20156,"So she says yes, asks for a transfer, B pays A for the processing fee, A now has profited 3 times from one FDW."
20157,"What if we spent $1 billion on migrant workers dorms from 2015-2019 to upgrade them to the new proposed standards, with subsidised all in one services and groceries so they don't have to go out and mingle so much during off days?"
20158,Therefore govt endorsed HealthServe was gutted without doctors to serve the migrant workers.
20159,"If we spent $5 billion in Feb, or $10 billion in Mar by solving the migrant worker problem ASAP by housing them in hotels and unoccupied structures, the result could be just as good."
20160,"There's heaps of racism, or should I say, just hate to people from different regions."
20161,"I agree with all the other posters that it's clearly both racism and homophobia, not just one."
20162,"This is vexing... if the maid had to resort to a gondola to escape, imagine her mental state at that point."
20163,"> It doesn't mean that these parents are racist, that they teach their children to be racist, or that their children are racist."
20164,"People are sexist, racist, etc without meaning to be (just take a look at the list of horrible things that people say to family members at CNY)."
20165,"We can get nuanced about it and say that this sort of racism is primarily a matter of ignorance rather than, say, some sort of vile hatred."
20166,I’ll stick my neck out and say I think people like Preetipls actually make the problem worse when she ascribe racist motivations to fuck ups of majority Chinese.
20167,"This is what happens when you spend too much time in Hollywood with all the obnoxious and pretentious celebrities - you catch the 'I am super sensitive and everything you say offends me',  and 'everyone is a racist for having preferences/opinons' syndromes."
20168,"We can only do so much.. like if only i have a grass cutter i’d go down and cut the grass myself and not wait for the FDW to do it, then i can call this community my own.. but is it our own?"
20169,Yet I wonder if our government's obsession with CMIO has been detrimental to the nation as a whole and will be moving forward.
20170,"CECA or not, Indian ratio in SG didn't improve by any considerable margin."
20171,"Forget about immigrants, even getting a VISA to SG with an Indian passport is difficult."
20172,Still the so called alternate media tend to stir things up with racist and fabricated stories.
20173,"The labor regulations for most white collar workers are laid out in the Employment Act, whereas those on work passes (migrant workers, incl."
20174,FDWs) are not covered by that Act.
20175,[Here's what the MOM webpage stipulates](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing) for housing of foreign workers - which in my opinion is way to lax and provides enough leeway for employers to take advantage of the system.
20176,"Paying foreign workers, although they are cheap , causes ""leakages"" in the form of foregin remittance to their home countries."
20177,As an expat the mindset was too disparate from my own.
20178,This is why my parents don't have a maid.
20179,"My sis had an unpleasant experience once; though less severe (idk what happened because I was < 10 then), but after that we no longer had a maid."
20180,But we as a malay which doesnt have the same security level as a chinese are to compete with PR/expat or whatever people are coming from to also get a job.
20181,We voice out so many times for YEARS but gahmen say no racism bla bla bla.
20182,"However, every time somebody tries to debate this issue, it gets labelled xenophobia and racism by the incumbent and shut down promptly."
20183,Does anyone think any expats will stay in times of war and disasters?
20184,This is why you dont leave the care of your baby to a maid.
20185,A maid helps in household chores.
20186,"You have to take a pre-departure test for Cat II countries, regardless whether it is VTL or not."
20187,And you don't have to take an on-arrival test if you are doing non-VTL.
20188,"So it's just one PCR test in SG, either at the end of your SHN or on arrival for VTL."
20189,This isn't a case of systematic racism.
20190,This is a case of *people* being racist.
20191,"Yes, we citizens as well the government can do more to fight racism."
20192,But this is not systemic / institutionalized racism.
20193,"Her original post wasn't political in nature, and her work has always been in relation to migrant workers' welfare."
20194,"I find the opposite argument, that ""We are all immigrants, therefore xenophobia is irrational"" makes even less sense because people raised here have no ties to either India or China."
20195,"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-16828134 https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1088378/hongkongers-want-fewer-mainland-immigrants  In the recent US presidential election Trump won an increased share of the Latino-heavy counties along the US-Mexican border and even flipped Zapaty county populated with 85% Latinos, which hasn't voted for Republicans the last 100 years."
20196,Every group of immigrants eventually develops their own sense of identity sufficiently distinct from where they came.
20197,As if the govt gives a flying fig about making maids happy lol
20198,"I am not trying to change the country, I am just saying the racism anywhere is bad."
20199,This has been abused in the early years by plenty of expats merely collecting residency visas.
20200,"Will his family have a convenient life in Singapore even if my uncle is just on employment pass, or will his dependents encounter some difficulties?"
20201,It's just plain being mean and racist.
20202,"Instead of attacking CECA, why not attack the lack of transparency in terms of work force numbers and data?"
20203,Instead of still trying to double down on CECA without the data to back it up.
20204,"This just in, [racist incident on video ](https://www.scmp.com/sport/football/article/3139698/euro-2020-star-ousmane-dembele-race-storm-mocking-asian-hotel) of French Euro 2020 star Ousmane Dembele mocking Asians."
20205,Just think about this racist idiot taking a knee and pretending to fight for racism?
20206,I really want to somehow say that this all in the context of national security and not some racist action.
20207,This letter REEKS of xenophobia
20208,This line of thought comes from the idea that an FDW is something we deserve or are owed.
20209,I was about to say something but I didn't cos it didn't look like this guy could carry the conversation and he seemed harmless (ignoring the overt display of racism) and my SO was about to unleash her inner ah lian but she didn't either since the guy moved away.
20210,CB is to keep community cases down while our healthcare infrastructure is focused on treating migrant workers.
20211,Last thing we need is have cases of both locals and migrant workers be on the upward trajectory.
20212,"The thing about racism is that it certainly cannot be “solved” short-term, and one might well argue that it cannot be wholly solved at all."
20213,"On an individual level, I might be conscious of racism and its effects, but there are times I catch myself defaulting to the racialized thought heuristics."
20214,"On a personal level, taking the care not to let that heuristic racism affect my decisions can get tiring – it’s just easier to, as a member of the majority, take full advantage of that privilege."
20215,"If we put the goal as creating a generation which will neither experience the effects of racism nor generate it themselves, I would wager that no person alive will see that day."
20216,"Racial Harmony, as you point out, gets (most) people to stop overt racism, at least in places where there are consequences for saying racist things."
20217,"It doesn’t address the root thought processes of racism, certainly, and probably does two counterproductive things."
20218,You note that racists tend to be “lower-classed”.
20219,I’d amend that point – the people who we can easily identify as racist tend to be “lower-class”.
20220,"If we reason that the state rewards those who advance up its predefined pathways, and that part of that conditioning involves learning how to keep your mouth shut about race, then it would stand to reason that those who succeed within the system tend also to be pretty good at not looking racist."
20221,"The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t an alternative to what we’re doing – it’s a warning about what happens when you fail terribly at addressing deep-rooted, systemic racism and attempt to patch it over with surface-level treatments."
20222,This may come off racist but i hope to clear up racism or such.
20223,I dont particully find it racist more like a slang to it.
20224,This may not be entirely classed as racism but along the lines of inclusivity/exclusivity.
20225,"This may sound really stupid but as a minority, why can't we agree on racism is bad and stop being racist."
20226,This means we need safe spaces to be racist in.
20227,https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o9joey/summing_up_this_week_in_racism/
20228,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think in order to shift the government mentality on family-raising, the maid-industry has to go."
20229,But it is another matter to be accusing others of being racist and discriminatory.
20230,"prejudice, racism, bullying to your child)."
20231,If FDWs could freely fly here and find work we would have way less of these problems.
20232,Though do take into consideration to see their point of view and not be so easy to dismiss them as prejudiced or racist.
20233,"But i feel they just don't want to pay the expensive meal for their domestic worker, so they give her cai png or make her eat at home first."
20234,"This new recognition of their humanity forces them to confront what they may have previously said about migrant workers:  ""If you don't study you'll end up like them""  ""Don't let the helper go out, later they'll mingle""  It's the notion that 'bare minimum' when mixed with classism it becomes vomit inducing."
20235,"On the surface, many preach about kindness and treating everybody equally but deep inside, many view foreign migrant workers as beneath them and will not hestitate to utilize them to do their ""dirty work""."
20236,This notion that the 'youth' are not racist is bs too.
20237,They should first call out their racist peers.
20238,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/racism-singapore-progress-in-racial-harmony-shanmugam-14986604
20239,"However, with the pandemic raging on, it seems that we are losing top tier jobs but we still need to depend on cheap labour apparently, thus the continuous need to import maids, cleaners, maritime workers, processing workers, construction workers etc."
20240,This pandemic is really exposing the awful way foreign workers are treated in Singapore.
20241,But are we also calling the Indian Nationals expats too?
20242,This place has become increasingly xenophobic over the last year.
20243,"Make your money like any other expat, and leave when ready."
20244,This post got the point across better than I did  https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/soucb7/black_people_tell_you_about_singapores_racism/hwcadog?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
20245,"Problem is, in my petsonal opinion, it seems many people, including the government and many expats, seem to want these locals to keep quiet and accept their fate  2) in my personal opinion, one thing unnoticed and ignored is r/sg is that actually, the government knows very well that Singapore (note that I say Singapore, not Singaporeans) indeed do need foreigners to survive."
20246,"But what is ignored is that while the authorities are very comfortable with increased foreign presence in Singapore's economy, it is not comfortable when vast segments of any industry/sector are dependent on foreign expats from just a few countries."
20247,"It is not that less foreigners are granted E-Pass, S-Pass or PR but the raw number of applicants have increased, due to the recent political situation in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and foreign talented migrants are fleeing from those areas, coming into Singapore, usually more skilled and more investment dollars, and there are only so many slots open for foreign talent."
20248,"He spoke on most of the hot button issues making the rounds recently, including foreign worker quotas, COVID-19, and the state of politics in Singapore."
20249,"I know I craved Singaporean food like mad when I was in London, and now that I'm back home I kinda miss proper kebabs, but do expats (not only white expats) miss Singaporean food?"
20250,This question was asked during class and some of the foreign students think that Singapore is overreacting and bordering on racism.
20251,This raises so many questions about the criminal justice system and the lack of protection for migrant workers.
20252,"This really became an issue around 15 years ago when our immigration policy became liberalized, leading to a huge influx of migrants over a very short period but the national infrastructure – housing and transport – did not keep up with the expanded population."
20253,The other issue related to this is the thin line between xenophobia and racism.
20254,"Also, people who abuse maids should not be allowed to hire one at all."
20255,"And if their family members are complicit, they too should be barred from hiring a maid and if they've hired one, the gov should really look if there's any abuse"
20256,Why would they bring up a racist preference to excuse another racist preference?
20257,But yeah the racism should be enough to warrant some police action.
20258,I don't follow her so I do not know if she has acknowledged how xenophobic her remarks was.
20259,"The thing is, there are few people who would fall outside these two categories, and these two categories have shown themselves to be so invested in Singapore (emotionally, financially) that it might be unfair to give a language test (especially for the second category)."
20260,But some people are so blinded by racism they cant even see the logic.
20261,"One supervisor at the vacc centre ain't gonna do anything to change the person's mindset, except make the racist think that all the staff at the center are hostile."
20262,"If the racist just stands there and argues, then the nurse giving the injection can't take more patients and reduces the capacity of the vacc center, making the wait longer for people."
20263,"If the racist refuses to get vaccinated and walks off because of that, that's one more unvaccinated person."
20264,"If the racist starts getting agitated, the police have to be called in, and that disrupts operations more."
20265,This sound racist.
20266,"Since they reject the racist accusations, all the more they should have met with her to clarify and understand where and why their perceptions diverge."
20267,"In the news article linked, ""*The researchers also found that Chinese respondents (4.8 per cent) reported the lowest frequency of racism, while Indians (13.8 per cent) reported the highest."
20268,"You wanna know what fucks up the ""Exclusionary SAP schools do the opposite of reinforcing a mindset to prefer one's own race in children's developmental years, as long as they aren't abolished, racism will continue to exist in Singapore."""
20269,This story is worse because the employer fell in love with the maid and abuse his own flesh and blood
20270,"This study highlights the lack of awareness of racism in Singapore rather than its perceived prevalence, I feel, as with all similar studies conducted at a nationwide level with a significant majority."
20271,This sub has been a xenophobic and racist echo chamber in the recent past.
20272,The recount of expats who haven't lived in singapore for years having to serve a nation that has given them nothing is not lost on me.
20273,This thing about blaming rejections and failure on racism is bad for the society overall.
20274,Stop these racism shit thing.
20275,This thing is just letting all sorts of the latent anti-immigration and xenophobic  sentiment bubble to the surface.
20276,This is a just a nice way to vent one's xenophobia in a politically acceptable manner.
20277,Is building foreign dormitory rocket science here or am I missing out on something?

20283,Malik express the not-well-known paradox of racism within the minority community.
20284,It also makes everything balanced since it’s obvious racism is there part of every community .
20285,4) racism is there and will remain to exist as long people have unique attributes .
20286,Do you believe that racism is the only form of discrimination in Singapore?
20287,*cough* xenophobia *cough* homophobia
20288,The article does not mention whether a replacement maid was offered and at what cost.
20289,It seems like Ms Zhuo wanted to end relations with the maid agency.
20290,I don't think the maid agency should have to do any more follow up in that case.
20291,"The unfortunate reality is that I have disassociated, almost entirely, from the ethnic facet of my personal identity as a result of rampant stupidity - namely, casual racism (from other races - which I accepted as par for the course for a long time) and colourism (both from other races, as well as my own race)."
20292,"If ""languagism"" was a thing, I'd throw that in there too (I won't explain this, but those who've had to deal with the ""speak in your mother tongue"" folks will probably know what I allude to)."
20293,"The dramatic flood of ""foreign talent"" (and any accompanying resentment) came only later."
20294,The saddest part is how few people on these forums call them out for such racist behaviour.
20295,"I was pretty much at the bottom of the food chain as a systems specialist but since there was no local expertise I was brought half way around the world on an expat package ""for a few months"" to help get them set up."
20296,"The expat package was necessary because my deployment was ""only a few months"", so my home and most of my home expenses were still active (mortgage, utilities, etc)."
20297,The maid and the man actually had sex.
20298,"To protect yourself from such accusations:  1) Don't have sex with your maid or other people whom you are not supposed to be involved with, because they may turn around and blackmail you, accuse you of rape etc if the relationship goes sour."
20299,"&#x200B;  On a social level, the narrative of constantly being under threat feeds into the need to be number 1 at all costs and propping up racism and xenophobia, which also justifies structural unfairness and the facades we use to ignore them."
20300,This was quite a few years ago but my former maid managed to build a huge bungalow for her family back in Indonesia after working with us.
20301,Heard that another maid in my block wasn't really given a lot to eat and had to ask my maid for food.
20302,"This was the policy enacted in early Feb: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/0203-additional-measures-for-newly-arrived-foreign-workers](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/0203-additional-measures-for-newly-arrived-foreign-workers)  'To further reduce the risk of transmission from newly arrived migrant workers into the workplace, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has decided to extend the post-Stay-Home Notice (SHN) 7-day testing regime to all newly arrived Work Permit and S Pass workers in Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors from higher-risk countries/regions1."
20303,MTF has also decided on mandatory On-Arrival Serology test for migrant domestic workers (MDW) and confinement nannies (CN) who have recent travel history to higher-risk countries/regions.
20304,"This whole convo started bc I insisted that such actions/remarks should be called racist, and you insisted that they weren’t because they weren’t intentionally racist."
20305,"Therefore, by my standards, you were ignoring racism under the guise of “it wasn’t intentional”."
20306,My point basically is this: a person may have done racist things in the past.
20307,"They may not have realised that they were racist, even/esp if they were unintentionally so."
20308,"That’s actually ok, but you shld acknowledge that they were racist, and apologise for them."
20309,"As far as I can tell, it seems like you’re saying there’s no need to apologise for such actions because the harm is unintentional, and therefore it isn’t racist."
20310,Any debate without acknowledging these issues and the rights of domestic workers is to merely skirt around the critical issues while wanting the status quo to remain.
20311,This whole event has just been for racists to come out and dogwhistle imo
20312,"Secondly, being someone who was brought up by a domestic helper, you know these people belong to the underprivileged group."
20313,This will help the xenophobia of the locals and the govt.
20314,Gulf states treat their migrant workers as *de facto* slaves and they remains rich and people suck up to them.
20315,"During GE, I can't help but notice that PSP like to harp on CECA A LOT."
20316,"WP didn't even namedrop CECA so prominently, but instead tackle the main problem: flood of Foreign Talent."
20317,Ooh ooh edit: We eventually let go of said horror maid.
20318,"NS helped reduce racism for me, University gave me a chance to* ***make mistakes*** *and learn to be less (though as you read, not completely) sexist."
20319,And encounters with racist folk didn't help too.
20320,LOL Inb4 Reddit tells you that’s racist And that Malays can own the whole kampung if they wanted to.
20321,People are losing their mind in the comments about this when the only material change is that previously both vaccinated and unvaccinated people from Singapore could enter Denmark (no return via VTL for unvaccinated obviously) whereas now you need a recognized certificate which is the EUDCC.
20322,Also strawman-ish as if it’s only expats who are chafing at restrictions.
20323,"The government might have a mixed-to-positive record on the handling of most aspects of the pandemic till date, but when it comes to the migrant workers, the performance deserves a straight F."
20324,We must have zero tolerance for racism in Singapore.
20325,"In the Netherlands for example, you pay flat 30% as an expat but you can make use of local schools, make use of same healthcare as locals, buy a property and lower your housing cost."
20326,It doesn’t neccessarily have any racist connotations within context.
20327,Those are clearly not the kind of immigrant workers that the article is talking about.
20328,Those are the racists?
20329,The immigration policy is not synergistic with their labor policies.
20330,"Those are very practical concerns, but they operate within the framework of maids being **necessary**."
20331,"Our government has very cunningly decided that the solution is not political reform but ""other"" people in the form of foreign domestic workers."
20332,"I find it jarring that a great deal of sympathy is expressed for, say, sick elderly who require round-the-clock care; but the same standard is sometimes ignored when we are talking about maids (how does one person look after a sick human round-the-clock?)."
20333,"Those aren't the despicable ones, it's the people who stipulate that their maids start work at 6 am and knock off at 11pm every day."
20334,Those countries itself don't have laws that make it disadvantageous to hire the spouses of immigrants.
20335,Though there are few in those countries who feel that immigrants are taking their jobs but they are usually mocked by the rest of the nation for being bigots or something.
20336,Those flying in without VTL can only come in if they’re PR/Singaporean.
20337,"If employers are genuinely concerned, send the maids on financial literacy courses, or coach the maids themselves."
20338,Those lorries are driven by migrant workers themselves.
20339,"Those maid are probably doing more work while on ""holiday"""
20340,The government can't do it anymore bacuse of all the VTL arrangements we have.
20341,"The real threat are those holding employment passes, who are snatching up jobs particularly in the PMETs sectors."
20342,Those people you mentioned don't have the time or energy to attend interviews and voice their grievances unlike the highly paid (relative to the work they do) expat waifus.
20343,"Those poor poor people, the maids should pay them for the days off that cause them such heartache."
20344,"I get that every country reserves the right to vaccinate their citizens first, but foreign workers deserve vaccines too."
20345,"Those seem rather tame, but i guess for singapore those could be considered really racist."
20346,"I've seen some elitist attitudes when it comes to singaporias, but not as much racist."
20347,"But spamming ""racist"", labelling people, or creating legislation doesn't actually change anyone's hearts regarding the matter."
20348,Those values are based off expat levels.
20349,Those who can buy 2nd/3rd/4th/5th properties as investment to rent out to expats are like minority and they are probably rich enough to survive a recession.
20350,"And where a million ants claim that maids and others are entitled to their human rights, then, maybe, there will be changes."
20351,"As for the space constraints, it is understandable but the domestic workers should be entitled to some privacy of their own."
20352,"After that he/she must choose either become a citizen, or an employment pass holder."
20353,"(of course he can still apply for student/employment pass)- reduce PR privileges.."
20354,"Though the lawyer has to attempt to mitigate her sentencing, geez for what she’s done to the maid she should go to jail."
20355,Though you have not experienced racism does not mean it does not exist.
20356,There has been reports of racism in Canadian news channels.
20357,And in Japan you absolutely do find lots of expats in MNCs.
20358,"It's not that SG has made it easier for expats, it's more that SG has made it far far more appealing for expats to get a job here, so a LOT more try."
20359,"Through the entire Preeti/Subhas and NETS saga, I've seen so many people online saying that the racism is so bad in Singapore they have seen many 'Closed doors' and are 'systemically oppressed'."
20360,"As part of the majority race, I feel like i need to understand these issues better, but most posts don't go beyond these terms to describe their personal experiences (beyond the casual racism jokes)."
20361,"What I have known is about the perceived discrimination against Malays in SAF (my friend, excellent soldier was denied a regular contract, which we presumed had to do with race)  Friends on reddit, care to share any cases where racism has closed doors for you?"
20362,But a recurring theme here is how a superior has abused authority with racist outcomes because of a broad stereotype of a particular race/laziness to integrate.
20363,"Throughout the entire course of the covid response period, we've witnessed incidents of **perceived** racism toward Indians by locals of various descent:  * [Chinese](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-investigating-man-accused-of-using-racial-slur-and-kicking-55-year-old-woman) * [Malay](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/man-allegedly-posing-as-sharonliew86-charged-over-offensive-tweets-against) * [Indian](https://theindependent.sg/go-back-bloody-indians-says-sporean-man-to-expat-family-at-pasir-ris-beach-park/)  The timing of these events however coincides with the failure of the manpower ministry to erect temporary stop-gap measures to halt the influx of Indian **nationals** (work pass holders & their family etc.)."
20364,[Were the Chinese local majority racist back then?
20365,](https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ezpeic/racism_and_xenophobia_helps_no_one/) [Can one be racist toward another of similar race?
20366,Take the [people whom are truly responsible](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/n8f2no/this_was_bound_to_happen_tw_racism_violence/gxiktjf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to task for this mess.
20367,Tiagong mod is also foreign talent that's why C|=CA is banned
20368,Tiers of residents in Singapore  1) Familee cronies  2) AMDK  3) CECA  4) Sinkie female  5) Sinkie male  6) Dorm workers
20369,"Tiktok is apparently a very popular form of entertainment among domestic workers, so it's very likely she posted it for laughs and giggles."
20370,Til racism and racial discrimination is 2 different things
20371,"Time to find out who the kids are and make them repent, while their parents express shock and disbelief because little Timmy is so ""sweet"" and ""innocent"" and helps everyone he meets and knows like, 1 non-white dude so he's not a racist and it's actually the small brained Chinese man who is trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill."
20372,Time to hunt down racist house owners on [99.co](https://99.co) 🔫 😵
20373,"Tldr:  >The results showed that while **Chinese participants discriminated against Malay** applicants (racism), **they discriminated in favor of White** applicants (the Pinkerton syndrome)."
20374,"The results provided a potential explanation to the economic disparities between Malays and the other races, and first experimental evidence for racism and the Pinkerton syndrome in Singapore."
20375,"Tldr: everyone gets racism, it's not unfair treatment towards Chinese."
20376,Tmr u report to one of dormitory to do waste disposal
20377,"To a fully-indoctrinated racist, that's a difference that makes no difference."
20378,"To add on to the Russian scenario, it really displays the inconsistencies as to what racism is considered in the west."
20379,"Oh so it's racist to SOLELY negatively portray Arabs as terrorists because it (rightfully so) enforces prejudice, but however it's fine to consistently portray Russians as villains, traitors etc because they don't face ""discrimination""."
20380,"To add on to this thread, someone has compiled a list of racist incidents in Singapore."
20381,[http://www.visakanv.com/sg/examples-of-racism/](http://www.visakanv.com/sg/examples-of-racism/)
20382,"To add on, TCB also said this during an [interview](https://youtu.be/BwaAsN5iSvQ?t=115) with mothership in the run-up to last year's GE:  > ""CECA is an agreement between Singapore and India to bring in to allow, I think, 127 categories or professionals to come to Singapore and be given that **free hand actually, practically free hand**, to come and work here""."
20383,"Bringing up memories alleged 'anti-Chineseness' is pretty toxic in a country where 75% of the population is Chinese and, what more, currently subjected to influence operations from the PRC   It is a failure because by forgetting the politics of Chinese identity, it has enabled this generation's ""activists"" to cherry pick examples from history to validate the view that there is ""institutional racism"" against minorities stemming from the colonial era blah blah, and that old taxi drivers who hold Nanyang U degrees enjoy Chinese privilege or whatever"
20384,"It can be true as a whole that Singapore needs a constant influx of foreign workers to replace our declining birth rate (which will get even more serious in the future), and at the same time, there are people who may have been replaced by cheaper foreigners, or felt that they may have been passed over for a job promotion because of them, leading to resentment."
20385,I would like to apologise for the conduct of these racist few.
20386,"To all those complaining that folks are being trendy and don’t really care - use this as an opportunity to call people in to having a real discussion, to really think about the issues of systemic inequity and racism in their own lives."
20387,"We are all products of racist systems and we all have a lifetime of work to do to be antiracists, not just people who consider ourselves “not racist”  I say this as someone who grew up in Singapore and now live in NYC."
20388,"Singaporeans are some of the most well travelled people in the world, it’s essential we consider how racism plays a role in our lives."
20389,"To answer your question, if you consider the that [non-local portion of the labor force is predominantly blue-collar,](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Employment-Summary-Table.aspx) then a fair deduction would be that the average foreign worker spends less than the average local worker does."
20390,"Obviously, you seem to think that ""expat"" implies ""white person"", and if we go with that questionable definition, then sure, white people probably do spend more than locals do on average."
20391,Singapore is a land of immigrants.
20392,And the thing is we don’t hire domestic helpers.
20393,"Firstly, I feel that not all maids are reliable."
20394,There are some cases where maids abused toddlers etc.
20395,"Thirdly, I actually shared with my parents that I don’t want my bro ended up closer to the maid and not his own family."
20396,"I have seen kids who are closer to the maid rather to their own parents, and it’s sad."
20397,I have friends who have maid all along.... even now; at the age of 17.
20398,"As for my bro, there are times I went to his kindergarten to fetch him and I notice that mostly the maid will be carrying their school bag."
20399,And he will actually ask how come we don’t have maid at home.
20400,"I have seen some families that have maid, their kids are very rude and entitled."
20401,"When I was young, I did sort of ‘envy’ my those friends that have maid at home."
20402,"However, as I grow up, I feel that it actually makes me a better person, without having a maid."
20403,I feel that there’s no need to have maid at our age( 17+) as we can help out our parents.
20404,"While complaining that they DON""T HAVE TO WORK  But to be fair, we are all victims, regardless migrant workers or not."
20405,To be clear - I have FDW and have earlier received message from this number.
20406,"Perhaps a more suitable headline would be ""280 foreign workers' approval to resume work rescinded after **firms failed to book mandatory Covid-19 testing**""."
20407,What you can do is start with a higher rent and deposit and negotiate accordingly depending on your racist so-called “risk profile”.
20408,But you are racist.
20409,"Ultimately if you are not able to be a commercially viable landlord without being racist, you shouldn’t be a landlord."
20410,"To be consistent with the city states constitution, should be language test of one of the four official languages."
20411,"It’s the same for white people - white passing black people like Meghan Markle are assumed to be fully white (or identify as such), and also deal with racist white people making similar racist assumptions regarding cultural views, etc."
20412,I’ve met Hispanic-Americans who talk a lot of shit about other Hispanics as being “grossly immigrant.” It’s always weird to encounter it.
20413,To be fair racism in Singapore is nothing like those outside where you get yelled at randomly on the street or getting ignored at the cashier.
20414,It’s subtle here compared to full blown racism like your Chinese friends experienced.
20415,"To be fair, Malaysians could travel back even before VTL so they aren't exactly stranded here."
20416,"To be fair, after paying for levy and accommodations, the overall cost for hiring a foreign worker is not very far off a local (for the same skillset)."
20417,"To be fair, most Redditors here are young and have never employed a domestic helper before but having one can present its own set of problems."
20418,Respect is a 2 way thing and sometimes getting a good domestic helper is a matter of luck.
20419,"To be fair, other countries don't have the dense living conditions of these migrant worker dorms."
20420,"Pretty much every other maid has a Facebook account, at least 1-2 phones and a good network of neighbourhood/agency friends these days, too."
20421,They don't want to offend the expats because it's economical.
20422,"Maybe the 7 unlucky ones aren't expats, but just white foreign workers."
20423,"Other regions are still growing rapidly so as long as Singapore remains rich and safe, we are bound to attract immigrants so technically it isn't far fetched to assume that immigration is not an option"
20424,EDIT: I'm seeing so many people being bent out of shape ITT over this and calling her racist.
20425,"I think that it's only racist when we make a judgment that being progressive = good, traditional = bad."
20426,"If you don't bridge this gap, what's so racist about an observation that she's making?"
20427,It's like saying that I'm racist for saying Indians have brown skin.
20428,"Now between the migrant worker outbreak and the guy falling out of a truck, I think it's time to tighten the noose."
20429,I have many indian close friends (they are some of the warmest people ever) and I hope racism will be gone too.
20430,"It's its based on pre-conceived notions of their character, then it's probably racist."
20431,And there wasn't much racism in secondary that i can remember.
20432,"So yea racism is still very prominent in Singapore, but i think because the younger ones are more exposed to it and also because of the pandemic racist attacks/campaigns, we are slowly progressing."
20433,"And to answer your rhetorical question as far as I am aware and read in this thread, many contract allows employers to switch maids within a certain timeframe."
20434,"With regards to your other rant, if you believe there is significant opportunity for abuse in all maids contracts and want to ensure there are specific criteria mandated in all maids contract to prevent such abuse you need to take your debate and argument to MOM."
20435,"However you are completely oblivious and confused as to the current incident which is, like i mentioned earlier - barring any fine print in the contract not privy to us outside of the article, that the maid reneged on the contract unilaterally and the employer should not be held responsible as such."
20436,"To be quite honest, I found the Preeti video funny bc it's true, as a Singaporean Chinese I know for a fact that many of us are racist and I personally found it hilarious that we're being called out about it, and quite blatantly too."
20437,For the most part I feel like many of those who got triggered over the video don't want to admit that many Singaporean Chinese ARE racist.
20438,"To clarify, I specifically mentioned victim of _racism_."
20439,"Because racism is institutional and historical and there’s no way around that, especially if we consider Singapore’s colonial history."
20440,"People can be victimized due to racial prejudice, but not racism."
20441,"Do you not at least believe it’s tone deaf to be woeful about being called a term that has ceased to be known for its derogatory meaning, in the context of this current instance of severe racism and xenophobia that is inflicting significant, tangible impact on people’s health and livelihood?"
20442,"To compare the ""suffering"" that me, an expat, or worse, a local, has with the foreigner workers is a level of stupidity that is hard to contain in words."
20443,"To consider citizens who only perfoo their duties permanently for 2 years and later are called for small stuff every year and have seen combat with migrant workers is not only stupid, is offensive."
20444,"To gauge how racist a society is, you don't look at actual racists or people who commit acts of racial discrimination, after all there will always be ""bad apples""."
20445,"Do they support the victim and denounce the perpetrator, or do they say things like ""oh he's just being too sensitive"", ""it's worse in other countries"", ""they are taking things way too seriously"", ""It's not *that* racist"" and so on."
20446,To hire (or not hire) based on the reasons you raised is a textbook definition of racism.
20447,"In contrast, a non-racist policy would be to hire specifically based on non-race indicators of whether would a candidate take frequent breaks, set clear expectations to all employees on break timings, as well as dietary facilities."
20448,"If these 3 sources were the only pieces referencing racism, then PA's accusation that Sarah is implying racism is a lot more contentious."
20449,"To me, it’s not racist but it showed an embarrassing lack of cultural common sense from the PA team organising the event."
20450,"To my understanding, the video challenges the social norms in Singapore as it is a public minority view of racial lines with nobody talks or keeps mum about, unlike Pewdiepie's which is a clear racist insult."
20451,"iii) She might not have asked him because he's a migrant worker, but because she felt he's someone who would be familiar with whether it's okay to open and access drain covers like these."
20452,"&#x200B;  If I were in a similar situation, I would be unsure about whether it would be illegal for me to open the grate to get my stuff, and I might have thought someone doing roadwork who happened to be not too far away (whether they're a local or a migrant worker) might be good to ask for advice and help too."
20453,I think it would be sad if one cannot share about the kindness of the person responding just because them being a migrant worker would trigger assumptions of being an entitled karen.
20454,Then it's rather racist to ignore her complaints.
20455,"Fifty years ago, according to official records, five times as many Singaporean spoke English at home as spoke Mandarin (a fringe northern Chinese language in a nation chock-full of southern Chinese folk speaking Cantonese, Teochew, Hokkien, or others); Mandarin is no more an historically authentic mother tongue of Singapore than is [Xhosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language)."
20456,"To racist old people, the kid’s nationality apparently matters more than his life."
20457,To say expats are the whole reason SG is successful?
20458,"As a SC, you are just full of shxt, and a valid source of resentment SG has against expats."
20459,We have strived over the years and will continue to go beyond what we have achieved with or without expats.
20460,"Looking across the world, xenophobia actually cuts along rich/poor gap more so than age."
20461,"Whatever hatred is spewed online against expats, local minorities, foreign Indians is not going to change much."
20462,"To some, being labelled racist is worse than facing racism because they've never experienced the latter."
20463,"Just to further justify my character, I once gave up a non reserved seat to a domestic helper who is younger than me because she asked me politely and told me that she isn’t feeling well and is a little giddy."
20464,"To take a positive step towards a more gracious and kinder society, a radical mindset change towards migrant workers and their welfare is needed not just from the employers, government agencies and everyone in the community need to be onboard too."
20465,Are you wise to blame migrant workers who have no choice but to live in those cramped dorms assigned to them?
20466,"To the ""progressives"" minorities cannot be racist (or the outcome is negligble) because they do not control the levers of power."
20467,"In this specific case, Macik has power over you via her pricing and then practices ""racism""."
20468,So minorities CAN be racist.
20469,"In saying that, I'm not racist and am pretty good with people) My university, University of Auckland, is around 80 in the global top 100 (120-ish in the top 200 according to some lists)."
20470,You chose to be racist.
20471,And I would also say that the bitterness of NS helped to fuel some of the racism that you see others do.
20472,"By calling it racism and doing just that, it's completely ignoring the root cause of the problem and you will continue to see more ugly bout of racism (towards foreigners) popping up."
20473,To write former maid before someone's names sounds so offensive !!
20474,So keep in mind that topics like racism are highly subjective.
20475,"At some point they all put on makeup to look like a different race, but I didn't see any criticism about the movie related to racism."
20476,Dam the aunty surely racist sia
20477,"Today I went to buy a banana shake 🍌  The stall holder , a Chinese lady went “ we ran out of bananas, do you want Mangosteen instead ?”  Fucking racist cunt, just cause I’m dark and wished I was white inside ?!"
20478,Anyway what’s with Singapore these days and racism stories ….seems like everyone has one
20479,"Racist attacks similar to or worse than the ones we've seen this year could happen, targeting people of Muslim descent or Indonesians, with our government throwing the book at the people behind the racist attacks."
20480,"-keen and dedicated  -training twice per week for 30 min to one hour per session and willing to train at home if needed  -sessions are evening and located in Novena (days to be determined) -focus points: safety, water adjustment, floating to basic movement and balance   About me: Teacher at an international school in PE, mother tongue literature and social studies."
20481,Tokenism doesn't change the fact that the centre-point of the rally was CECA something only connected to indian immigrants.
20482,Also these migrant workers aren't training for war
20483,"Tons of Singaporean immigrants in Australia, NZ, US, UK, even France, Germany and Japan these days."
20484,Tons of expats are dying to come to SG.
20485,"Too bad that society here shun those workers, till the point that even before this happened, nobody gave a shit about dormitory conditions."
20486,"We already stoke a lot of xenophobia just from ang mohs, what more if we give PR to what those people will call “lowly, unskilled, smelly workers”."
20487,"It’s always about the policy and perhaps their oversight, and people need to know this instead of becoming legitimately xenophobic."
20488,Today’s case 102 is a FDW.
20489,"That's part of the blowback from having a profoundly racist, narcissistic founding dictator."
20490,So it’s not racism but struggle to grasp their conduct.
20491,Too many ppl complaining about bto wait times and unable to hire domestic helpers.
20492,Now that u can do ur art test at the woodlands station before going it’s so easy to travel to Malaysia (provided u manage to get bus tickets of course)   Personal experience: going to Malaysia via Land VTL was actually very smooth sailing and since each test can be done via CLEA/self declaration.
20493,"Top of my mind:   Safer and secure - can go running at 2 AM without worry  Convenient   Limited racism - mostly its benign, can be tuned out  Easygoing, friendly people  Easy to find a group of people who share your interests, no matter how niche  Access to best brands/products  Friendly tax policy  Almost all cuisines in the world are easily available  The work culture is much more relaxed/not as irrationally competitive  Probably the best public transport system in the world  Singlish is awesome"
20494,"Total cases (including 15 April): 3699 Total cases of foreign workers: 2221  We have a crisis on our hands, it's going to be interesting to see how this will play out."
20495,"Yes, it was wrong to use the photo of the couple without consent, however, it is absolutely in no way racist."

20497,"We hired the 2nd maid due to my bro was in K1.She was a good maid,also does discipline us(we were a muslim family & she is very religious upbringing despite came from a small village).She & i used to have quarral over small issue(again i was in my teens,so didn't think much about others feeling).i used to be 'what on my mind i just say it' rather than 'think before you talk'.However she ask to be sent back as her dad gotten ill."

20505,"It is a free vaccination, no racist auntie should be pacified."

20510,"It was only with the wisdom of time, the accumulation of knowledge and moving somewhere else and meeting different people that I truly saw and felt the insidious effects of casual racism."
20511,"Casual racism is most definitely endemic in our society, and a great many people in Singapore can’t see that because of a lack of perspective."
20512,"So please, before you accuse me for having a ""trashy mindset"", observe our society and reflect as to why my race, my people have been classified with foreigners that boast the highest number of domestic helpers being sent around the world."
20513,"Feel free to watch the racism documentary I directed called ""Singapore Insider: Casual Racism in Singapore."""

20516,Translation of the main story for non-chinese folks:   Ms Zhuo warned the maid in advance that her house has 4 storeys.
20517,"However, the maid regretted after working for 10 days."
20518,The maid started work on 1st Sep. She woke up at 6am and worked until 8 plus pm every day.

20521,"When questioned, the maid said she couldn't work here anymore."

20523,"Unfortunately, the maid was determined to leave."
20524,"Ms Zhuo said, ""I didn't want to force her, so I brought her back to the maid agency the next day."
20525,"Surprisingly, the reason the maid told the agency was that my house is too big."""
20526,Ms Zhuo continued that she paid $2048 to the agency to hire a maid.
20527,"According to the rules, when the maid arrived, she paid the maid 3 months salary, $1760, in advance."
20528,That was actually what the maid had to pay to the agency as commission.
20529,"""It was the maid who wanted to leave, but I had to lose thousands of dollars,"" Ms Zhuo lamented."
20530,"No matter how many times people explain that CECA is not the cause, people cannot let it go."
20531,This data is found in singstat -	Number of indian ep holder has gone up 5x in last decade (but still < 2.5% of population) -	CECA does not allow for free movement of people in the sense that people think.
20532,"this has been repeated over and over but to no avail  If anything needs a review it’s the EP process, but that is an entirely different process from CECA."
20533,On work permit holder I haven’t read anything in any of today’s press releases
20534,"Traveling now is really a wild west, sure you may have your VTL and travel insurance, but all it takes is 1 outbreak to make you miss your flight, get extra quarantine, take extra leave, spend extra money not covered by insurance etc."
20535,"Treating a FDW like a pariah isn't going to make the newspapers, but I also can't help but note that word is originally Tamil..."
20536,Treating domestic workers as subhumans is as Singaporean as Laksa and Cendol.

20548,"True, at least the foreign workers don't go cycling in groups large enough to invade a country"

20550,"True, but the *chances* of you experiencing racism if you're a majority are much lower than if you were a minority."
20551,"True, but you'll get a bunch of past due letters and eventually phone calls seeking maid to repay."
20552,"True, maid salary in singapore is around 2x of average salary of fresh graduate salary in Indonesia."
20553,The challenge there is whether those countries (or any other) would open their borders to foreign workers that are just a tax revenue without creating other jobs that go along with the management body.
20554,It is sad that we have come to a point where one must be overcautious to express dissatisfaction and criticism towards a particular race's customs and traditions without coming off as a racist.
20555,"Reactionary mindsets are holding us back, people need to realise that racism perpetuated by the dominant ethnic group is usually institutionalised, it’s not as overt as one would think."
20556,True.. but also ironic that a malaysian is saying this considering racism is even more rampant across the border
20557,"Then there was the PRC whining about travel restrictions on them, until they imposed it in March."
20558,Trust me when I say most landlords in SG are racist POS.
20559,"You should know I moderate a Facebook group that assists expats with navigating the travel restrictions, and my take on that matter is that it's something that will change over time as we transition to endemic, with countries like Germany being the ""closest"" while others may still require quarantine."

20566,"Using your ""brownface"" as an example, if in a concert play, a few kids is supposed to put up a show on racial harmony and because they do not have malay or indian etc classmates in their cohort, having some children put on some makeup that ""darken their faces"", are we going to claim this is simply racism because of ""brownface""."
20567,"Where is the common sense to consider the ""intent"" or the ""intent"" does not matter here simply because it did not fits into the ""racism"" narrative."
20568,I work a lot with Western expats and their families currently.
20569,They are an NGO dealing with migrant worker issues in Singapore.

20574,"Stop posting pictures/videos of people who obviously ""aren't like us"" to cover your xenophobia and virtue signalling."
20575,"Back on topic, most Singaporean treat their maid as the modern equivalent of a slave."
20576,I would recommend living somewhere in Jurong East (where there are several malls) or further East at Holland Village (expat land) so your poor family has somewhere to go while you're at work and you don't need to travel too much to work.
20577,I gambled a bit - was prepared to do the 7 day SHN but when they announced the VTL I managed to change my flight for a small fee.
20578,It was very empty considering it had only been announced as a VTL flight a few days beforehand - I counted about 16 passengers in total in economy.
20579,"Most of us locals are just too used to it haha and sometimes asking politely doesn’t work anyway, especially if you’re talking to an elderly person who only speaks mother tongues or dialects."
20580,Twc2=transient workers count too
20581,Tweaking foreign worker policies but at the same time expecting FTs to assimilate further into local culture might not be an easy feat.

20583,Two expats from my small department are leaving early next year.
20584,But at the very least take a slightly broader view of things and come to an informed decision instead of just going “foreign talent bad I don’t like”.
20585,There’s a ton of nuance to the foreign talent issue on both sides of the argument that don’t get discussed enough IMO.
20586,"That being said, if for instance one finds the issue of “foreign talent” for example overwhelmingly negative to their life here, then it’s definitely valid to vote based on that one issue."
20587,"abandonment of an entire policy without a viable solution)  I could be thinking too much, but I feel like I see this sentiment a lot as well (crude example: “walau foreign talent taking our jobs, all foreign talent should just fuck off)."
20588,All that talk from Indranee recently about how we consider cultural fit when it comes to accepting immigrants....what a joke.
20589,"I don't take these things lying down but most people, especially expats leaving the country won't want to go through the hassle, hence these assholes get emboldened over time."
20590,I was told it's quite similar to FDW.
20591,If not how can the dormitory owners enjoy their luxury yacht or party bungalows?
20592,U are crazy if u think a half decent solution involve getting singaporeans to apply to be domestic helpers or getting rid of foreign domestic helpers altogether.
20593,U are local not expat.
20594,"U can't actually be serious, and what makes u think that the shit happened to foreign workers wouldn't one day happen to us as well?"
20595,U guys reckon this is why the MNcs n big investment banks r hiring CECAs over the local chinese?

20600,"U.S., China and Rules-Based Order  In his maiden budget speech in February, Wong addressed another possible disruptor to the “rules-based” order, the growing strategic competition between the U.S. and China, which is playing out in Singapore’s home field of Southeast Asia."
20601,"Lots of expat friends in similar positions, if not left, planning to do so in the short term."
20602,Net net this may be offset by those fleeing HK - but for us long term expats the message has been received.
20603,"Sg will remain an expat hotspot but only due to the lack of regional competition, and increasingly less so on it's own merit."
20604,"If they tell you omicron numbers in ICU, they'll need to reinstate VTLs"

20607,"US expat, spent about four months here in SG."
20608,If those flights all change to VTL it's going to harder.
20609,"My school has a pretty decent international student population so racism wasn't tolerated, though on the flip side you do notice that people do tend to hang within their own groups: locals with locals, Chinese with Chinese, etc."
20610,Maybe  increasing foreign worker levy by 50% every year will cause construction firms to start investing in more technology
20611,"Ugh poor husky :( I hope the domestic helper has stopped with the behaviour, and that the neighbour informs the owners, in case the dog needs treatment."
20612,This is about maids taking their off day on a **weekday**.
20613,"Not to say it doesn't accurately depict racism but... this is kinda confusing, actually?"
20614,Also VTL flights were full to the brim.
20615,Uhh the government can introduce measures for companies to reduce their dependency on foreign workers?
20616,"Uhh you're an expat in Australia, not in Singapore."
20617,The way you wrote this post makes it sound like you want to continue labelling yourself as an expat when you move to Singapore later for NS when you're not.
20618,Uhhh... Japan had less than 6000 illegal immigrants from the Philippines in 2013 (last year I can find stats on).

20620,Ask any Singaporean without a foot up their ass if Singaporeans are racist and they'll answer some version of yes
20621,I don’t think it’s xenophobic if after repeated experience someone has a preference for local nurses over foreign labor if they know from experience there is a difference in quality of care.
20622,I’m using my mom as an example because it’s a good example why someone saying “yes” to being offered a Chinese nurse (which to my mom is the equivalent of getting a locally educated more skilled nurse because Chinese nurses are local) does not mean they are being racist.
20623,The latter IS racist; the former is much less so.
20624,"It’s not like I can run an AB test to see how her response would change and determine if it was truly racist  Ps: if you think there is a problem when I assume the best of her intentions, well this thread is doing the same assuming the worst of her intentions."

20645,Understand that not everyone is comfortable with being confronting the racist person up right but is there any other way we can do to help the victim?
20646,I think I have read something about a Muslim lady being targeted with racist remark in the public transport (in western country) and another lady simply sit beside her to start a conversation so the racist person get totally ignored in that case.
20647,Uneducated low class boomer *being racist*.
20648,"Unfair hiring practices to favour own countrymen is not racism, according to people in white."

20661,racist and believing it's right.
20662,I think the good thing is that workers can't be replenished back that fast now due to travel restrictions and hopefully this forces construction companies to push on the automation front.
20663,"most of the racism I witness is from my superiors/bosses at work talking to other Chinese people (without minorities around), and I don't dare to say anything firstly because everyone is my parents' age, which is intimidating, and secondly because it might get me in trouble."
20664,"Engaging with racist will only proves their rhetoric right in their twisted mind so but by ignoring these pests, they will be seen as the crazy, misinformed and very disgusting individuals."
20665,"Unfortunately, I'm sure the mentality of ""we are better than them"" that some people have toward maids will be inherited by their children."

20676,https://dailycaring.com/7-ways-to-respond-to-mean-dementia-behavior/  The mental filter that stops a person from saying racist/sexist or otherwise “non-PC” things is often the first to go.

20700,Unpopular opinion: Why aren't the migrant workers cleaning up after themselves?
20701,"Unpopular opinion: maybe, instead of a conveyor belt of temporary foreign workers who are used and discarded without ever being allowed to grow roots, we should dismantle the Work Pass system and switch to a mix of locals and renewable long-term employment passes."

20724,"I guess that is why many domestic helpers are willing to tahan the nonsense some terrible employers put them through, for lack of a better word, this is as good as it gets for them."
20725,Then I realised some of the funniest racist jokes are also the most stereotypical and socially fragile.
20726,But can’t say much without people going “don’t be racist”.
20727,"Nothing racist, just personal factual anecdotes."
20728,"This means there will always be xenophobic people who are pro-LGBT and highly religious folks who support woman's rights, for example."
20729,Using depression as a defense doesn’t work when the entire family is committing violence towards the maid.
20730,"Using extreme words like ""rampent and explicit racism"" coming from a Malaysian itself."
20731,"After I graduated, managed to get a job, and been here ever since (about 5 years working experience)  What are your thoughts on the likely future tightening of foreign talent policies and how would it affect you/your business/talent acquitision?"
20732,"You just go with it without doing your homework, and you'll be branded as doing an act of racism"
20733,Everyone has a right to not face racism.
20734,And between casual and institutional racism.
20735,For example contrast the racist attack the chinese guy faced recently vs the indian lady who was briskwalking.
20736,Thats the worst story you got about racism ?
20737,Its hard to feel sorry for your compared to a couple who were just minding their own business and got verbally harassed by some racist.
20738,The comments here about unverified stories of racism posted on IG stories varies from believing in those to asking if they are being over sensitive or if those stories were faked or to think of the racists pov.
20739,Same for the incidents of racism reported on news.
20740,Racial harmony isn't based on shutting down minorities when they speak out about racism.
20741,Pick either meritocracy or racism.
20742,Even usa stopped having race based immigrant policies in the 50s or 60s.
20743,You want to complain when the whole immigration policy is based on not letting minorities make up a greater percentage of population due to higher birth rates ?
20744,Minorities have to put up with foreign workers not being able to converse in english when they go to retail stores or food courts.
20745,"Usually expat divides are also related to language barriers, but that shouldn't be an issue in Singapore IMO."
20746,Could be racist depending on context.
20747,Was OP normally racist?
20748,"Usually will default to the fathers’s mother tongue, but the family can opt to have the child take the other language instead."
20749,Who dare to employ her as maid again?
20750,"Usually, you just swipe your passport on the electronic gate for both entry and exit, since Singapore can cross-verify who you are and whether you technically have an employment pass, etc."
20751,Tired of people throwing tantrums at migrant workers who despite the stiff odds have come to earn a respectful and deserving living for them and their family.
20752,VTL = Vertical take-off and landing?
20753,"VTL allows SQ to have a near monopoly on some routes, non VTL doesn't and hence is cheaper"
20754,VTL applies when you are entering singapore.
20755,What VTL basically dictates is how you are dealt with when you land in singapore.
20756,"Flying out of Singapore, VTL/non-VTL doesn't really matter."
20757,VTL bus tickets are not transferable.
20758,"VTL can be kept ""open"" for the other party to reciprocate: see Brunei."
20759,VTL can be used for price gauging flights as those limited flights are more likely to have more seats sold and hence SIA can increase fares.
20760,VTL can only be done on specific flights dedicated to the scheme.
20761,It makes no sense to have a VTL with NZ when there's no such flight.
20762,VTL don't make sense in a world with 99.7% of asymptomatic cases.
20763,VTL expansion?
20764,I can't wait for VTL and PCR/ ART abolition and unfettered movement as long as you're double vaxxed.
20765,"VTL flights are Singaporean invention, only flights to Singapore are VTL flights (with exception of South Korea)"
20766,VTL flights are incoming flights only.
20767,VTL flights are literally double the price of non-VTL flights.
20768,VTL flights are only for flights arriving into Singapore.
20769,Reason for the VTL flight is not to mix transit passengers.
20770,VTL flights are the result of SG government trying to help SIA.
20771,"Correct me if I am wrong here: - Flying a non-VTL flight from NYC to SG --> requires quarantine - Flying on a non-VTL flight from NYC to Amsterdam and transit to a non-VTL flight to Malaysia, makan with non-vaccinated pals and then immediately take a VTL flight to Singapore --> no quarantine required."
20772,This VTL BS makes no sense to me.
20773,"VTL flights are twice, three times more expensive."
20774,VTL flights just a proxy for SG G to control the number of pple entering.
20775,"So, chances of EU countries pissed with how SG allocates VTL flight schedules is nil since no tourists are really coming to SG"
20776,VTL for now is still the same.
20777,But it was mentioned that the direction is to remove concept of VTL and replace it with Vaccination status.
20778,VTL has become Very Tedious Lane
20779,VTL has designated airline tho
20780,VTL is BS.
20781,VTL is a Singapore exclusive though.
20782,"VTL is going to be removed next, listen to the press con"
20783,VTL is just anyone can come and go if I’m not wrong.
20784,VTL is just to concentrate traffic onto Singapore carriers.
20785,VTL is nonsense.
20786,VTL is only coming back.
20787,VTL is such bullshit.
20788,VTL is targeted more towards business travelers whose employers can cover the additional costs of the tests
20789,"VTL isn't being removed, it's basically affirming that the only difference between Cat II and VTL was the specific flights requirement."
20790,"All existing VTL measures still apply, and there's still differenciation within the General Travel group."
20791,VTL lanes are nothing but a cash grab; convince me otherwise.
20792,I flown both VTL and non-vtl flights.
20793,The only difference was cost (VTL higher) and passengers (VTL again higher).
20794,"VTL means... swab before go there, reach there swab again then come back another 2 times?"
20795,VTL more expensive
20796,"VTL much more problematic than arriving from any country on any flight, with no testing"
20797,VTL no need.
20798,VTL requirements to Singapore from the USA is retarded.
20799,VTL to China when?
20800,VTL to Penang??!!
20801,VTL with RTPCR makes little sense.
20802,"For non VTL, RTPCR before boarding should be enough."
20803,VTLs are more expensive and have limited seats.
20804,"Having taken both VTL and non-VTL flights, that's literally the only difference I noticed with regards to the flight operation."
20805,"VTLs are a relic of a past, a transitionary step which does nothing but to slow the recovery of our airline sector."
20806,VTLs are one way.
20807,"Even if Korea is on VTL, I believe you'll still have to serve quarantine in Korea."
20808,VTLs are open for applications for pretty much everyone.
20809,"The non-VTL categories are exclusive to SC, PRs, LTP holders, and special cases such as family members of SC/PRs."
20810,"VTLs only apply for flights coming into Singapore, so going direct (non-stop service) to the States is not totally necessary."
20811,"In my opinion, and from reading a bunch of comments here, the VTL seems a bit obfuscated as people seem to think for all destinations they would need a VTL round trip ticket."
20812,"VTLs seem to take a long time to establish, so by the time the decision is made, the situation has changed."
20813,VTP only applies to VTL flights
20814,"That said, while women’s rights are very strong in Singapore and there is more awareness of racism and religious harmony, LGBT and males (esp local males) are severely shortchanged."
20815,The people in positions of power are the small number of PAP elites and the large number of foreign expats in management positions.
20816,"For eg, a strong, independent, straight Singaporean Chinese lady would find Singapore very conducive for career advancement and snagging a well-to-do expat for a husband."
20817,Valid points and I'd say Opposition got a +1 with CECA.
20818,"(policy level) and how the majority can proactively be more inclusive, call out casual racism etc."
20819,"Very interesting insight - certainly the ""Wolf Warrior"" mentality and the sudden rise of vehement racist displays in Singapore can be correlated, but would be interested to understand if there is any connection."
20820,"Nothing is “in tatters”, Ms Chua just can’t VTL with her child."
20821,"Looking at the exploitation of workers, maids, and others that go on in Qatar, Singapore is very much comparable to Qatar in this regard"
20822,Their accomodation would be the actual HDB flats or carpark or posh apartments they were building.Cooking facilities were whatever were around at that time.Domestic maids were from the same countries.Weekends were usually a bit chaotic & fights were a common thing.
20823,"Officers were in fact engaging the domestic helper of the elderly woman, asking her to inform her employer that the elderly woman was seen not wearing a mask, and reminding the domestic helper to remind the elderly woman to wear a mask."
20824,The officer did buy food for the elderly woman and the domestic helper can attest that there was a packet of food with the elderly woman when she arrived at the scene.
20825,">The BWC footage shows clearly that the Police officer was advising the domestic helper to remind the elderly woman to wear a mask, and was not taunting or reprimanding the elderly woman; and that the officer did buy a packet of food for the elderly woman."
20826,">To ensure the privacy of the elderly woman, her family and her domestic helper, Police will not be releasing any further footage."
20827,Kudos to the foreign worker!
20828,All racism is equal btw.
20829,"There are different levels to racism, we have it good here in SG."
20830,"Abroad the racism is more in your face and confrontational, you would get sucker punched, spit on or stabbed."
20831,Not the quiet maybe I'll avoid them racism in SG.
20832,Then they'll experience real racism.
20833,"Some guy got beaten up by assholes, that doesn't make the whole of Australia racist."
20834,Virtually no one objects to foreigners taking on construction and domestic worker jobs in Singapore LOL.
20835,"That said, racism seems to be on a downwards trend, and the overall approach by the government shouldn't be changed too much."
20836,"Also according to the article, as this involves a domestic helper she can get twice the maximum sentence - 20 years."
20837,The seems to be no real justice for domestic helpers.
20838,Real change happens from displaying your keyboardmanship from home and talking about racism and change and all that.
20839,WFH would in the long term mean that there is no need for an expat to be physically present in Singapore.
20840,Many expats take jobs in Singapore so that they can be in Singapore.
20841,"- Rob the maid, by throwing her belongings - Sexually assaulting maid - Causing bodily harm by kicking private part."
20842,Try putting yourself in the maid’s shoes...to be physically abused like this and then being locked in like an animal.
20843,The employer should also be charged with kidnapping since she kept the maid against her will.
20844,Your own downtrodden heritage as an Indian Chinese and racism plagued life?
20845,Wa how you all expat here and there one ah.
20846,I also wanna be an expat leh.
20847,Waaaaah why can’t I be racist in peace?!
20848,Why must people point out how racist I am?
20849,"It violates the Competition Act, which is why the maid agencies were fined."
20850,"Contrary to your previous misleading comment, they were definitely not being punished for the act of increasing the maids' wages."
20851,"Wages of maids are not ""price""."
20852,"Wah NP has become the poster child for ""what not to do""  From golden showers to racism, how else can you surprise us?"
20853,"Wah lao, see breakdown of numbers also racist... everything also racist."
20854,Order white coffee instead of black is racist.
20855,I like white carrot cake means racist.
20856,"Wah piang eh win already lor, everything take xenophobia and racism and throw around."
20857,We didn't see the government coming out to address the issues of the previous foreign workers/students breaking the rules/temporary law and try to stop their repatriations or permanent entry bans with words like xenophobia and racism being thrown around did we?
20858,Is the government really that scared to offend these expats?
20859,"They are people too you know   >To better match maids to eldercare jobs, the joint study recommended, among others, an accreditation system to certify maids’ skills and train them adequately."
20860,">Meanwhile, to deal with overwork, the study recommended strengthening laws to protect maids such as by regulating their work and rest hours, and mandating written contracts to cover all the terms and conditions of their employment."
20861,Wah sia That’s super racist.
20862,I once heard a racist thing being said and it was so hurtful and it wasn’t even to me.
20863,Let me start by stating that racism is real in Singapore.
20864,"In this particular instance, it's not racism but country preservation that we need to block flights from India."
20865,"Also, since you're the youngest, and you're already 20 years old, instead of hiring another full-time maid, you guys could always look into a part-time cleaner."
20866,"Wah, your this statement is heartbreaking and makes a lot of sense, cause if MMTF will do what they're doing to their own countrymen, those foreign workers barely even register on their minds"
20867,Wait for the Chinese people to tell you there is no racism here 🤷‍♀️   But nah definitely not as bad as the UK.
20868,"That somehow a private business is somehow public, therefore you cannot be overtly racist there, but for some reason a public listing of a rental is somehow more private, thus you can be as racist as you want?"
20869,I thought there was a law that said that maids had to be given a day off every week or something
20870,VTL is one way or 2 ways?
20871,Wait till you find out how much migrant workers are paid.
20872,This is why our country is so dependant on migrant workers.
20873,Source: Brother used to manage migrant workers.
20874,Wait until investigation all finish first before y'all kpkb say 'like this also racist' and shit.
20875,"Now, a fresh maid cost about 500 a mth and a experienced maid can go to 700 a mth."
20876,Even i paid more for my maid.
20877,If you are white then you dont have to worry about racism due to the pinkerton syndrome present in Singapore
20878,"Wait what, it's illegal for FDWs (only!?)"
20879,The police site says:  > Warn your FDW of the severe consequences if they are caught assisting the loansharks in illegal activities.
20880,Racial preference is the very definition of racism.
20881,Doesn't matter if you express your preference overtly or not; racism is racism.
20882,"Wait, a Chinese born immigrant is bullied and called ""Chinaman"" by Chinese singaporeans?"
20883,"Wait, does it mean maid is not allowed to quit without reimbursing the costs of hiring them?"
20884,"Wait, so it’s not a given that VTL resumes on the 21st?"
20885,"Wait, so you can take a ART test again for VTL’s?"
20886,"Wait, so you have a right to have a domestic helper and treat her however you like, but she has no right to be in the same country as you?"
20887,"Wait, so you're asking for minimum wage only for locals, and foreign workers dont get min wage?"
20888,"Wait, you cannot get an employment pass in SG if you have HIV?"
20889,Looks like they want to make it as expensive as possible for companies to apply for these employment passes.
20890,2.6k is paltry for an expat couple?
20891,Waiting for them to tighten  They would tighten domestic than to give up their VTLs
20892,"Walao, mask off to take selfie, i rather distance myself if i were that migrant worker."
20893,Want one boiled minute maid with ice please
20894,Want to be xenophobic but don't know the difference between a random NDP song vs national anthem.
20895,Want to maintain social harmony and prevent racism?
20896,"Want to share encounter, start off by waxing on about how its unfair how maids are treated?"
20897,This maid could easily have been silenced in jail.
20898,Was absolutely disgusted by racist agents while house hunting even though I'm Chinese.
20899,"They would just say the most blatant racist shit and expect me to agree, like wtf do I look like a motherfucking racist to you?"
20900,Was actually referring to the post itself as the very reason why it was blown up was due to her claiming it's due to racism.
20901,I've asked people not to stereotype the majority because that itself is racism but was met with tons of downvotes on here as well.
20902,And I honestly don’t think there’s much racism.
20903,But I have almost never hear anyone say or do anything extremely racist.
20904,"Was from a SAP school myself (Chinese high before it merged), and I didn’t feel like it contributed to any additional feelings of elitism or racism."
20905,I can see how such an environment can lead to racism.
20906,"When SAP schools might breed racism, I think madrasahs are even worse, given the emphasis on religion."
20907,Was hoping for Thailand to be added to VTL.
20908,"You’d be amused by how many Chinese singaporeans over there who were surprised by my being able to study in germany, surprised at my supposedly being more intellectual than my malay peers were the same ones complaining about racism from Europeans."
20909,"Was in Turkey too, but managed to change my flight to the VTL."
20910,It's pretty frustrating that some of the opposition have chose this xenophobic racist horse to ride on to get support.
20911,"But usually, due to some arrangements, they are already offering Higher Chinese/Chinese Language as their mother tongue."
20912,"Another friend even asked if he was tired or grumpy, to which the reply was a blanket racist remark (She's a very slow learner and THIS COUNTRY they are thieves and will steal your things)."
20913,Was it ever specifically addressed if CECA allows free movement of certain categories of workers in the sense that it restricts us from imposing any numerical quotas/cap on the number of EPs (vs. regulations on qualification and salary levels)?
20914,"I know the govt's position is that EP quotas would be undesirable anw, but would CECA make it illegal for us to impose them altogether?"
20915,Pretty sure a number of the older generation were racists too.
20916,I think it’s a mixture of racism swept under the rug back then coupled with the lack of social media.
20917,"Including commute time in Manila or Jakarta, as well as overtime, the working hours are similar for domestic helpers here and back home."
20918,"Choose an explicitly pro-maid employment agency, like A Pratama who our helpers have come from for the better half of a decade."
20919,"Choose a transfer maid, who desperately needs to find a new employer as she would have to go home without a salary if she does not find one."
20920,Maximise and sponsor her exposure to the various experiences available for FDWs that organisations provide.
20921,"Most places in Europe are cheaper than SG is anyway, and for return flights with VTL I paid less than 1k."
20922,"Was on the bus a while ago and I saw an elderly lady (at least 70 yrs old) walking unsteadily to her seat, with the help of her domestic helper."
20923,Was planning on whenever Japan is open next year for VTL to catch Band-Maid live there.
20924,I think we’ve become all too casual with casual racism.
20925,Was talking with couple of friends and i made passing remarks that I'm not (never been) attracted to other race except my own and I got called racist.
20926,"Was the original comment really that this is ""racist"" though?"
20927,"I think there's a difference between ""PA is racist"" and ""this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”""."
20928,Was there a link to the original court case which convicted the FDW?
20929,How can maids jump ahead of the line to citizenship?
20930,Was this before or after you said old people were nationalistic and racist?
20931,Not sure if the following two counts as racist  Worked in a Fortune 100 MNC where local interns are paid $1000 but foreign interns are paid $2000.
20932,"There was a great disconnect when seeing how locals were allowed to go out and meet friends, generally having the freedom to do a lot of stuff whereas the migrant workers were still indefinitely confined."
20933,Was wondering about it after reading the comments on the racism threads
20934,Like employers getting infected then passing it on to their FDW?
20935,"Edit:  > Only 17 foreign domestic workers (FDWs) here have been confirmed to have Covid-19 so far, and they did not get it from foreign workers."
20936,Article from last year 23 April: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/17-maids-in-singapore-have-covid-19-none-infected-by-foreign-workers-in-dorms
20937,"Going by your logic, Malays must be 'notoriously' racist as well?"
20938,"(Especially in tech, because that's where most of the ""foreign talent"" goes to)  Just genuinely curious because the people around me who studied IT are in decent jobs from Software dev to IT ops which pays quite well."
20939,So yes you are xenophobic.
20940,"Edit: So, that was tongue-in-cheek I don't really think you are xenophobic, it's okay to think about these things."
20941,We also need to make it much easier for maids to report abuse and dedicate more legal resources to defending them so that they wont be afraid of reporting such things.
20942,"But for real, as a malay dude, I've gotten use to the racist remarks and encounters to the point I just think it is part of life."
20943,We are absolutely overly reliant on FDWs and in my ideal world most families would probably be priced out of having one anyway because we pay them way too little.
20944,Just under 1% of all employment in developed countries is domestic workers.
20945,"We are currently having almost 26k daily covid cases, and migrant workers are still not allowed to leave their dorms outside of work or ""Essenital Errands""."
20946,I feel very guilty about living in Singapore right now knowing that our comfortable lifestyle is supported entirley by the efforts of migrant workers who are treated in a way that would not be out of place in the mordern arab emirates or apartheid-era south africa.
20947,"We are mostly immigrants leh, just had the advantage of being here earlier (thanks ah ma ah kong nai nai and yeye) so it’s quite ironic."
20948,We are mostly racist towards Indians for some reasons
20949,"We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population."
20950,"We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force."
20951,We are not on the same page when it comes to racism.
20952,"Preferring a certain race, especially one of your own, is not racism in my eyes."
20953,"Making a negative assumption about a certain race, or disadvantaging 1 specific race, is racism."
20954,"If preference was racist, then I would HAVE to date someone of a different race in order to not be racist."
20955,But that would mean that I am racist against my own race.
20956,Several countries have already introduced travel restrictions on arrivals from Wuhan.
20957,"We are ready for non Chinese PM  No need for reserve Presidency, Singaporean are not racist  Meanwhile.........................."
20958,We are really just shit when it comes to our treatment of our migrant workers
20959,Have you seen racism in a kindergarten?
20960,"If some of his Chinese friends had been willing to speak up and say racist jokes aren’t cool, wouldn’t his experience have been a little different?"
20961,Or if his gf had pushed back against the racist comments of the auntie they encountered?
20962,"You're almost always regarded as second-tier compared to the expats parachuted in, and the frustration mounts when they prove within months of their jobs that they have no clue what they're doing."
20963,We can do better for the maids but as one minister will say - that is life.
20964,We can resurrect LKY's spirit by reproducing his racist quotes everywhere.
20965,We can't continue what we are doing just because countries like Dubai treat their foreign workers worse than us.
20966,"We can't socialize, so why should FDWs be allowed to socialize?"
20967,Families with young adults do not really need FDW.
20968,The excuses that racists can come up with to justify their behaviour is amazing
20969,"We definitely should raise more awareness about racism, and call out on racist incidents."
20970,"But the way you describe the lady like the epitome of racist evil, is it really fair to her?"
20971,"If it were a Chinese playing the bell, would you still read so much racism from the lady’s face?"
20972,"We did the same for our maid too, but she stole a lot of my clothing and just talks to her boyfriend on her phone all day instead of working."
20973,Just goes to show that it really depends on the character of the maid too.
20974,We do not have to look into COVID-19 to uncover racism in Singapore.
20975,My example was to show how any sentence could be taken at face value and insinuated to be xenophobic.
20976,"Among many issues, Singapore has to take a harder look at our more than liberal immigration policies which brought in massive number foreign talents to the point where Singaporeans are at times discriminated in out own homelands."
20977,"Next, citing that Singaporeans have suffered untold miseries, he is pushing for the abolishment of CECA without review."
20978,He has blamed certain parties for wasting time reviewing CECA without uncovering the tradeoffs and the merits.
20979,"Parties which proposed reviewing CECA were Progress Singapore Party, Red Dot United and Singapore Democratic Party."
20980,"Meanwhile, the sec-gen of NTUC said:  >Two accidents last month have shown that trucks and lorries should not be used to transport migrant workers, and the labour movement is working with partners to push for the implementation of different transport arrangements as soon as possible, said National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong on Sunday (May 9)."
20981,Mother tongue can be the same as normal mother tongue.
20982,SIA cabin crew member has now infected her husband and maid.
20983,We have a roadmap for migrant workers.
20984,"We have about 290-300,000 foreign workers."
20985,"Is it really better for the employee/renter when racist employers/landlords are legally required to hide their racism and ""force them"" to employ/rent out to those they discriminate against?"
20986,"In other words, do you really want to work for/rent from a ""hidden"" racist?"
20987,The government acts impulsive and overprotective like helicopter parents and the local community increases in resentments against expats.
20988,"We have so much care for our foreign workers, but we do not have the basis compassion for our own people that is living in poverty."
20989,"At the end those who do it for the migrant workers will require it of our people, the poor in the country."
20990,"Do not take me wrongly, i do not see helping the migrant worker a bad thing, but it is just that over zealousness without a clear mind will do everyone no good."
20991,"A luxury that we (and our helpers and other foreign workers) can so little afford that there is *massive* papaganda and cultural pressure applied to keep things as they are, and to convince sheeple that change is by definition unpatriotic."
20992,"We have to acknowledge that even if the minority groups in Singapore do not face precisely the same kinds of discrimination that minorities in America or Europe face, it *does not mean* that institutional and/or structural racism does not exist."
20993,"And thus, when some say that concepts like “reverse racism” or “Chinese privilege” do not apply *in the same way* as they do in other countries, it is also important to  1."
20994,"It's not about xenophobic when to landlords, its a case of costs outweighing benefits when things go sour."
20995,I would not disagree with you on the term of people being xenophobic but my point is we have to know why they are being like that.
20996,"Like you said, you have positive examples, those people who you happily label 'xenophobic' have their negative examples."
20997,"Again, yes, it doesn't entitle them to be xenophobic but again, a business/investment venture is there because you want to make money."
20998,Being a maid in Singapore is not bad when you consider the hellhole they call their home.
20999,"Make no mistake, Singapore may not be a utopia but for most of them, being a maid is definite upgrade in their lives."
21000,We keep hearing that CECA creates jobs for Singaporeans.
21001,Because it is one of the mother tongue.
21002,We literally have the same racist requirements when choosing our president and pm.
21003,Without the taxes collected from foreign workers and without their contributions this wouldn’t be the place that it is.
21004,"We make AMDK memes and stuff but it's never overt racism or vitriol, can't say the same when it comes to other Asians."
21005,A way to allow people to be more open towards foreign talent is to give low and middle income people a cut of the money from foreign talent.
21006,"It can slowly increase as AI, automation and foreign talent brings even more value to Singapore."
21007,"We need FDW to do our menial labour so, so that we can get richer.. by doing (less) menial labour for our financial superiors"
21008,We need a much more effective way to deal with casual racism.
21009,Not just racism but many other social issues too.
21010,"Casual racism, #metoo, animal rights, stigma against mental illness, weightism, ageism, heightism, foreign workers working condition, charities in poor countries, ect."
21011,We need better transportation methods for migrant workers.
21012,We need expats as much as they need our men to serve NS to preserve our country's economic and physical stability.
21013,Treat our migrant workers humanely!
21014,Racial / religious harmony in Singapore is something we have been conditioned to accept as evidence that racism or racial issues don't exist.
21015,"If you are scared to employ a maid, think the agents are making a killing and the govt is not doing anything you must be living a dream."
21016,Then don’t get a maid.
21017,Everyone is getting complacent because it is largely migrant workers.
21018,We need to stop letting foreign workers travel in the back of trucks.
21019,Saving cost on transporting workers at the expense of safety is a disgusting proposition.
21020,We need to stop relying on poor migrant workers and get locals to work in construction.
21021,"Because of the currency difference, she gave up her career to come work here as a maid."
21022,We not racist.
21023,"This is very disappointing, local media has occasionally publish articles using the term CECA , but the direction the mods take is to filter this out."
21024,CECA is a real economic agreement.
21025,The influx of foreign talent has depressed wages.
21026,"*VTL supended... nooo u promise*  We plomise, we didnt promise  Smh"
21027,We segregate children based on their mother tongue and reinforce certain racial stereotypes via bullying.
21028,We really have a maid abuse problem huh
21029,"Just imagine a platoon of foreign workers falling in Smart 4, march to cookhouse for breakfast."
21030,We should just deploy our vaunted SFI cookhouse to prepare the meals for the migrant workers.
21031,"We should solve this mess first, then decide what to do with these dorm operators and the foreign workers companies later."
21032,Can’t say the same bout the expats.
21033,The VTLs are already highly restricted gateways.
21034,We went for Europe trip recently through VTL.
21035,"We won't believe there's racism unless u show me proof, right?"
21036,But that by no means that we don't have any racism.
21037,We're equally racist!
21038,We're not discussing whether ALL use of CECA is pejorative.
21039,"CECA is being discussed as a trade agreement, and the downstream social consequences because of it."
21040,No one is saying that talking about CECA is purely racist/xenophobic.
21041,But there are enough people out there who use CECA on regular people with that intent.
21042,"There's no need to worry about overt racism and the such, if that worries you."
21043,"I'm not saying there are no xenophobic people here at all, but hey you'll find assholes everywhere."
21044,It's just easier for them to do so in industries specified in CECA because of the lax work passes/visas.
21045,We've heard about how Singapore needs immigrants to grow the economy and fill certain gaps in the labour market.
21046,"Under such a system, the government would set annual quotas for different classes of immigrants (high skill, low skill, dependants, FDW, construction etc.)"
21047,"This ensures that companies hire immigrants only when they absolutely need to, and that the best candidates that provides the most value is picked."
21048,"We, the citizens of Singapore,   pledge ourselves as one united people,   regardless of race, language or religion...  All racists please go back to school and learn our pledge."
21049,"We, the people, need to be protected from racists like her."
21050,Weather: it's a dam swamp that rains for months with a month of haze  Safety: most places are safe as long as you're not an asshole  Overall I like it here - except for the weather and racism
21051,"Wedded not only to covid zero, but also brainwashed to link migrant workers to disease."
21052,"Many singaporeans already had innate racism towards migrant workers of certain skin colors, and last year's dorm case explosions made it worse- it's like giving them confirmation and a good excuse to avoid darker skinned people in their lives."
21053,"Truth be told the restrictions on migrant workers is bar none the worst of our draconian pandemic measures, nothing comes even close, not even preventing social visits during cb last year."
21054,"For leaving your house:  (*fa*)to visit a parent or grandparent of the individual or a parent or grandparent of the individual’s spouse;  For allowing others into your house:  (*e*)to receive not more than 2 visitors a day —  (i)both of whom are ordinarily resident at the same other place of residence (which must not be or in a specified dormitory); and  (ii)each of whom is either a child or grandchild of the individual, or a spouse of a child or grandchild of the individual,  if no individual had earlier in that same day entered that place of residence for a purpose connected with paragraph (3)(*ca*), (*f*) or (*ia*)(i)."
21055,"Weird how you can equate a common enough complaint from South, South East and East Asians as something different demographics can share but when it comes to corrupt hiring practices Singaporeans are racists and solely shitting on Indians."
21056,"Then by your principles, then they are racists then."
21057,"Singapore wouldn't exist without the low skilled immigrants doing all the construction work, and the high skilled immigrants doing all the senior business and finance jobs."
21058,"Weirdly enough, I've gotten more racism from Singaporeans than either America or Australia."
21059,"In both instances, I was nervous at first but I can only think of one instance of outright racism in rural America (A guy in another car gave me a disgusted look likely because I was in the front seat with my white friend driving."
21060,"So far, I haven't gotten any racism in Australia, rural or not, despite very openly being in a mixed race relationship."
21061,"I would say if you don't want touristy place, then go explore neighborhoods for food, Instead of touristy areas or areas that attract expats."
21062,"Inevitably, you will encounter racism and xenophobia."
21063,Welcome to Singapore: where casual racism is normal.
21064,"Haha, you're probably going to be fine since you're a western immigrant."
21065,"And are foreign workers looked down upon?"""
21066,"We're not inherently racists, but we're not race-blind either."
21067,"Having said that, Europeans from developed nations are at the top of the expat pecking order, call it colonial mentality or whatever."
21068,She has pretty good videos about the expat life here.
21069,"I purposely did not mention the COVID response as feel it is a one-off thing and it is kind of hard to judge whether the response was good and bad (speaking more for the policy side, the dormitory was a screw up)"
21070,I just haven't ever seen any PRC immigrants do the alleged acts like shitting in the street.
21071,There are A LOT of PRC immigrants in Singapore because it's not like they all left after the government lowered the rate of immigration after 2011.
21072,"If the UK deports every Singaporean working there because 2 Singaporeans abused a maid there, would that be fair?"
21073,Anyway it's not like there's a comprehensive statistically vigorous study on the rate of street defecation by PRC immigrants.
21074,"Maybe you live in a vastly different social circle from me, but I don't see a point in assuming that PRC immigrants are all street shitters just because some randos on the internet says so."
21075,"The word is not at fault, but rather the ignorance around it and the abuse of it to excuse racism."
21076,Well I ever tried to do the non racist thing by renting out a room to an Indian national.
21077,"I dont think they are racist as they feel superior, they just hate people who are different."
21078,So my cunt is racist I guess.
21079,Compare Singapore workers and foreign workers.
21080,The real free market position is that SMEs will hire the people they can pay the least for and who will work the hardest - that group is almost always going to be foreign workers.
21081,Only once I had an encounter with this customer who was a lawyer being racist towards me.
21082,Lol but other than that generalising Aussies as racist abit unfair.
21083,Well I was the racist in primary school.
21084,"Well I'm not Chinese and I think this is, at very least, unintentional or casual racism."
21085,You do not promote any sort of harmony by dismissing concerns about racism in this manner.
21086,"I don't know why you are making this a comparison between the UK and Singapore both societies harbour racism, it's presence in one is hardly a justification for its presence in another."
21087,This is why instead of China crying racism.
21088,"Instead of screaming racism, they chose to change negative stereotypes by educating their people to stop displaying those negatively and stereotypes."
21089,Just that she is unwilling to travel via non VTL route and be slapped with a SHN when she comes back to singapore
21090,"Well at least they back their woman, at least that's better than the PAP who left their man in the lurch but still back their racist comments."
21091,Well at least they didn't close the VTL ok lah I go test
21092,"Well basically for the Germany VTL, you could fly in from a non-VTL country which is classified as a low risk region in Germany, like say Spain, to Germany, stay there for 14 days, and then come back to Singapore on a VTL flight."
21093,"This can't be done in the South Korea VTL though, since South Korea is not open to visitors yet, whereas Germany is."
21094,The only evidential feature I can bring up is the amount of awards given to questionably racist comments on some of these threads.
21095,"Either we have EDMW trollers on here seeking to make their vitriolic mark, or that it's really just hidden racists lurking in this affirming each other."
21096,"Well before people shit on the decision, is there a scenario where the domestic helper cliques are crowding out ie."
21097,There is no lack of foreign talent trying to get in.
21098,Well clearly the natives here wasn’t smart enough to do that last time and got overran by immigrants.
21099,"Still, our foreign workers are far away from home, far from their loved ones, any opportunity to spread cheer and joy should be taken."
21100,Govt is elected to serve citizens or expats?
21101,"Companies are more than welcome to continue hiring expats, just don't expect handouts from the govt lo."
21102,"Funny right, expats lose out to locals now because your beloved company decided that it doesn't hurt to take bailouts from the govt at your expense."
21103,"Well expats are being specifically singled out regarding vaccination, which is something that ONLY singapore does."
21104,"Every other country in the world doesn't care if you are a citizen or not, all are treated equally regarding vaccination, but Singapore specifcially told  young expats they are at the back of the line."
21105,Well her soul stinks more than the maid ever could.
21106,"Well i must be new to the internet, since im pretty sure only recently two of our local singaporeans were exhibiting bad behavior by being extremely racist/classist."
21107,"Anyway,many elderly i have seen are quite choosy in the bus.Got lots of empty seat at the front,want to seat behind.On one occasion,there 2 elderly aunties were boarding the bus 975,Bus were semi full of Foreign workers going back to their dorm at Lim Chu Kang.There were 1 seat each(1 in front of me & the other is opposite).Both seat has been taken by Foreign worker.You know what the aunties do?They pinch their nose.I immediately shake my head?Is this how Foreign workers are been treated in Singapore.I am totally fine sitting beside a foreign workers.Why can't these aunties do the same thing?"
21108,"I am puzzled why are foreign workers in Singapore are still being treated like they are dirty  or they are smelly,but do they even realised that their body odour are bad also?"
21109,"So historically, F&B restaurants pay low wages because that is what workers (foreign workers) are willing to work for."
21110,Compare this to the foreign workers who are all hungry and willing to work hard.
21111,The fact also that this figure’s xenophobic and logically-flawed arguments have won him the support of some Singaporeans (albeit not enough to win him a constituency) worries me greatly.
21112,"Well if we can accept further delays to our BTO, we can accept foreign workers to the community."
21113,Ie email from boss to disregard local candidates and go ahead and hire expat.
21114,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-08/singapore-to-finetune-foreign-worker-policies-amid-expat-angst  Good luck to you in trying to hire/get hired in Singapore, this kind of globalist mindset with no concern for the host country doesn’t work in Asian countries if you haven’t realised."
21115,"Well in boom times, expats and workers from overseas are welcomed, in shit times, any government worth its salt will try to protect locals because the locals are the one that voted them in"
21116,Just wondering what's the point of the discriminating measures (whether for unvaxxed or migrant workers) when it's already a covid party out there with a mostly fully vaxxed population.
21117,Well in this case the maid don’t agree to the workload and see what happens?
21118,But now the exodus of talent and expats (see Deutsche bank CEO) it is getting less relevant.
21119,Well it's easy to also blame dormitory managers.
21120,"Well it's true that Singaporeans are xenophobic and exclusive, but I notice a lot of the PRC Chinese also self-exclude anyway."
21121,"I immediately told her that was an extremely racist generalisation to make, and it was unfair because she obviously hasn't met every single malay person."
21122,Well logic is risk of hospitals being over-run by vaccinated people testing positive via VTL is same as someone testing positive here so doesnt make any difference i assume
21123,Well maybe as a start let’s have MOM conduct inspections on site and interview the maids.
21124,Well migrant workers aren't put into the same situations as military training...
21125,"An expat who is rich, smart or both have options to migrate anywhere in the world."
21126,The point is that you ascribe some kind of presumptuousness to individual expats or even the poster your talked about rather than having a discussion about the role of expats in the economy of Singapore.
21127,Well obviously we need plenty of foreign workers.
21128,"In fact, you may actually feel safer on a VTL flight since all were tested just days ago."
21129,Well perhaps dubai really will become expat central.
21130,Developing and upskilling locals to take managerial positions previously reserved for expats is a good thing and something Singapore should do.
21131,"I realized it might be a ""trend"" as nowadays it's more connected, imagine before coming over to be a maid/helper, over at their country, they will discuss, ask and talk about how is it working in Singapore as a helper."
21132,Well preferring going through the trouble / using quotas on expats instead of locals for the same level of qualification is plain stupid.
21133,"Then I guess it depends on the company, I've heard about those crazy expat packages with overblown salaries, accom, car, chauffeur, nany, ~~drugs~~ (Ah no, that's Wall Street), but where I work everybody, locals and expats, are treated the same based on their skills, simple as that."
21134,"In effect the more senior positions see a higher percentage of expats, but not because of some evil prejudice against local, but simply that it is hard to find competent people, so it becomes a simple case of statistics, the population of Singapore is a drop in the ocean compared to the rest of the world, so of course the numbers are going to be skewed."
21135,"Well said, I don’t believe there’s a systemic racist conspiracy involved."
21136,"Sorry to put you in the spot but to many young Singaporeans, the need for foreign talent isn't as apparent, especially when there seem to be upper management spots reserved for foreigners that Singaporeans cannot themselves aspire to."
21137,"There is no need to be confrontational, but at the very least show a look of disgust at the racist to make him know such behaviour is not welcome."
21138,"CECA is actually just a small issue, the foreigner flood has been a problem for many years, and it is one of the reasons the PAP lost Aljunied in 2011."
21139,I find it disappointing that people here are dismissing the issues of racism and coming up with different scenarios to justify their beliefs.
21140,"If you want to know whether there's racism or not in Singapore, just have a heart to heart talk with your non-Chinese friends."
21141,"Just because they themselves never encounter any racists throughout their whole life, they think it applies to everyone."
21142,"And just because you don't think something is racist, it doesn't mean everyone feels the same way."
21143,"It's not enough to just downvote and move on, because xenophobia has a real purchase in Singapore and on Reddit."
21144,"If we want to see fewer of racist and xenophobic comments in Reddit, we need to actually reply and push back by providing arguments on why these types of xenophobia are wrong, hypocritical and self defeating, even if it means being attacked and being mass downvoted."
21145,No one is saying racism should be celebrated but we should go a step further and really analyze and pry why this is happening.
21146,Well she isn’t a maid abuser now because she abused hers to death.
21147,How is that racist?
21148,(unless the intention was to be racist of course)
21149,"Just as it's not right to stand by when someone is getting assaulted, it's not right if we leave these racist remarks unchecked."
21150,"An equally important discussion, but do not conflate that with CECA."
21151,Well that's mainly because of the cost involved in hiring a maid.
21152,"Speaking as someone coming from Singapore and now in Australia, give ANZers a live-in maid service for AUD/NZD 500 a month and we'll see how quickly it becomes commonplace."
21153,"Shops don't close at 5pm, 24-hour shops/eateries are extremely common, public transport is (used to be) efficient (and is still better than Australia), and the live-in maids help to settle domestic obligations."
21154,"Without maids, people in Singapore would need to spend a bit more time doing household chores, and therefore in general the country's productivity would take a minor hit."
21155,"Of course I absolutely don't agree with any maid abuse, having also seen it before, but just speculating on the impact of having maids in Singapore."
21156,Not so ignorant since I employ a maid.
21157,Well the point is obviously the fact that you can’t differentiate between racism and xenophobia.
21158,Your definition of xenophobia itself is intriguing.
21159,I support your point in the original comment but I wanted to clarify the difference between racism and xenophobia.
21160,"Well the racism is in the law, shocker for a foreigner to see 4 nationalities based on people’s DNA."
21161,Well they applied to be here under the list of jobs detailed in CECA.
21162,Well they are high earning expats.
21163,Well this is called racism and is wrong.
21164,Since you seem to not take issue with it I will assume that you yourself are racist.
21165,I think most reasonable people will agree that this is wrong and racists are not good people.
21166,No doubt people will be eager to arrange travel again once the VTL freeze is over!
21167,"All that said, I think the US is just as racist and xenophobic as Singapore; it's just that in Singapore, it's legitimized, legalized and institutionalized by government policy (and thus no one feels that they're in the wrong) and in the US, it's all hidden behind the veil of PC."
21168,"But the CECA arguement from fallacy, has been left to fester for too long, that without addressing head on the misconceptions, we can't truthfully look at other issues within employment"
21169,Hiring is going to be very very tough and borderline foreign talents will be let go rather than their salary being increased to match requirements  Usually blind salary raise to appease requirement will cause commotions in the workplace.
21170,Spouses of foreign workers in this sense are foreigners as well.
21171,"If one were to lurk in r/Singapore without going out to touch some grass, Singapore will seem like a racist hellhole far worse than America"
21172,"Well you can do illegal shit like this, and the maid can also refuse to work."
21173,Once you start accepting other cultures you'll become more aware of what's considered racist.
21174,Most of the times (atleast in instances of casual racism) I feel that people don't know that it's hurtful for the other person.
21175,"Well, France had its injection of a large Muslim immigrant population that still brewd very prodigiously (and cause a lot of consternation among French)."
21176,"Well, I agree that when people use the word they usually don't have any racist intent, but the word originates from racial stereotyping."
21177,"Well, I don't think publicising it on instagram serves any purpose, but her domestic helper sounds really rude in her texts."
21178,"""u say i'm the maid right... so u have to know ur place as a boss""  WTF."
21179,"I know it's not PC to say it, but some domestic helpers are really nightmares to deal with."
21180,(Somehow there's this false premise that **every** domestic helper in sg are hard working young women who has to feed a family of 64 back home and has to deal with entitled S'porean bosses.
21181,"It just seems like I am the idiot for pointing out obvious racism, and your comment was in the middle of a bunch of other comments that made me a bit agitated."
21182,It was just this racism thing I wanted to get some views on..
21183,"So long live Singapore, and all that, but it is a bit racist in some parts.."
21184,And if the maid mutually negotiated her rate and is happy with the extra income.
21185,I used to employ part time helpers and they are working for expats who basically don't have much for them to do and their employers allow them to earn extra pocket money by doing extra home cleaning jobs outside and they did.
21186,Gum tree was filled with such part time maids.
21187,"And yes, I totally agree with you that no migrant workers in their right mind will ever demand anything openly, fearing retaliation."
21188,"Well, I would disagree in the sense that this may not necessarily be racism but more of nationalism instead."
21189,"Though, I do agree sometimes that these 2 big ideas can be conflated and that racism still does exist."
21190,"Well, I'm curious as to how a flight gets designated VTL."
21191,"Presumably, it needs to be a non-stop flight, otherwise the stops and origin need to all be in VTL/Cat1 places."
21192,"Btw, how extensive is the ""mother tongue"" education?"
21193,"Biology in French, Math in English) I understand command/comfort with Mandarin is a spectrum among the Singaporean Chinese, but I think my friend has simply run into some self-hating people AND he has a skewed idea of what the whole ""mother tongue education"" consists of in Singapore."
21194,20 years of liberal immigration policy and many Singaporeans today are convinced they have not gained from such a policy.
21195,"Generally, non-local founders also do quite well but focus on more high SES/atas (local slang, essentially means premium in this context) and expat market segments, then later expanding more mass market."
21196,"People are probably most racist for the other reason you mentioned because for every set of immigrants, there are bound to be at least a few uncivilised people who come in and ruin the reputation of all the people."
21197,"Well, at least Singaporean racism is not directly violent or oppressive, right?"
21198,"Well, even if there is a legal definition for racism, it will not be known to a lay person."
21199,"Further, examples of potentially racist or culturally insensitive behaviours are not taught to be avoided too."
21200,I agree that it is premature to think that the concept of racism would be defined by the majority race.
21201,"Well, everybody has a car, my wife drives one, I drive one, our maid drives one too."
21202,"Well, if the lock down really does apply from Wednesday onwards to really bar all Malaysians from entering Singapore, even work permit holders, and also given the current flood of people surging over causeway, as of 16th March Monday night, I do wonder if we might see a sort of like a quasi- refugee problem in Singapore............"
21203,"Well, if the maid suddenly decides she don’t want to work anymore and want to go home, she can secretly buy a plane ticket and fly out of the country and employers will be fined a hefty amount."
21204,"Well, if your mother tongue is malay and you meet customers from malaysia or brunei it's still useful."
21205,"As long as everyone is willing to pay the price of Sentosa cove for their next flat, I suppose we can wean off foreign workers."
21206,"I come from an european country, where having a maid is for the super rich."
21207,"Well, it is normal practice for companies to declare high salaries but pay the foreign workers minimal salaries."
21208,"Well, let me break it down for you - expats are paid for the house rent cos no HDBs for them, for school fees for their kids, social security cos no CPF for them.. now, at the end of the day, expat might be saving the same amount of money for the same job but might be paid 2x due to difference in expenses"
21209,"Well, most construction workers generally work in SG temporarily but they are typically not called expats."
21210,"Well, my maid did steal and frame me before when I was a kid."
21211,After investigation turns out the maid was calling her family/BF back in the Philippines behind our backs.
21212,"Well, not according to our expat friends in this thread."
21213,"Well, only racists say the most racist things…"
21214,"Well, our leaders say there is no 'racism'.. How can CNA-IPS study talk different?"
21215,"Well, racism is hugely popular among the older generation in most western countries."
21216,"Well, salary for a mid level manager in my company for a local is 230-270k.. so apple to apple comparison isn't much different since expats need to pay for rent and kids education.."
21217,"Well, she can say she is not ""racist"" and I am still puzzled why she is not charged and arrested."
21218,"There are car washes to be found everywhere, and foisting off work to your maid that is a paid service elsewhere feels like exploitation."
21219,"If it turns out that the employees were indeed racists, punish accordingly lor."
21220,"If it turns out that the employees were not racists, then punish the malay auntie with what the employees would've been punished."
21221,It is extremely in my place to comment on racism.
21222,"But I think the issue is worth talking about..  Or else, people like me who come to this great country and faces racism will start to get racist towards the people being racist to us.. And that's a vicious circle I won't be a part of.."
21223,"I mean the expat community, for those who have not already left, are pretty livid about the LOC, the vaccine roll-out, the re-entry permit, not seeing the family for 2 years, etc, etc… I mean I know this has been a tough two years for everybody, but those of us that are still here are starting to be really fed up, so still hammering the nationalist rhetoric right now, which always comes out during election but normally goes back in the bank a few months later, is not really making us feel loved."
21224,"That's the main issue; rather than local promotions of currently talented, experienced staff, many employers prefer hiring overpaid foreigners on expat contracts."
21225,"We are placed on an unlevel playing field because our circumstances are inherently different from every expat who has the advantage of not having the problem of predetermined local entrants to higher education, minimum wage laws to enable you to pay for your own education and/or expenses working part time and many many more comparative advantages."
21226,Basically racism and xenophobia is the gov's fault.
21227,"Well, thats unfortunate that your maid got pregnant, hopefully it wasnt early in the contract period."
21228,"Positives :  - It's super clean  - It's organized and well maintained (public transport, traffic and government offices are fucking amazing)  - It's safe and peaceful (in general)  - Food's good  Bad :   - Freedom of speech and censorship  - Weather (including the Indo haze issue)  - Expensive  - Lack of things to do  But that's the evaluation of a filthy expat with little experience (2 years) in the country, so feel free to disagree."
21229,This lady is pretty clearly a racist motherfucker though considering it's a god damned needle jab.
21230,But putting those designs in for a cultural event or holiday and you’re getting fired for your designs faster than you can say ‘racist’.
21231,A systemic racism problem.
21232,If you think that Singapore government invites foreign talents for other reasons beside absence of qualified local workforce - could you name those reasons?
21233,"Well, to them anyone who is not Singaporean and have darker skin tone are all foreign workers."
21234,Before I am accused of xenophobic.
21235,"And hey before I am accused of being racist, I am a Chinese."
21236,"Well, when everybody ""justifies"" the racist practices with excuses, and Government just hides behind the words of ""pragmatisms"" or ""market forces"", the identification of people based on ""race"" rather than ""nationality"" will remain in Singapore."
21237,"Well, when said poster starts racist shit on “salty Chinese Singaporeans”, it bears relevance that who he is referencing is no saint either, right?"
21238,"Why can't Singaporeans acknowledge that we just have the issue of racism, or at least, discrimination based on colour/nationality?"
21239,">	Just because racism might have played a role in the referendum, does not mean it’s a main factor in the GE."
21240,She is a known to be an entitled racist.
21241,Well-being of maids might be better if they live out.
21242,"Most importantly, maids aren't little children that need looking after."
21243,"My family hires a domestic helper to help take care of my grandfather, who requires constant care that we cannot provide."
21244,"Ie, tube feeding (which the maid learnt to do)."
21245,LKY was talking about scruffy and untidy foreign workers from third world countries doing 3D jobs.
21246,It might be a fine line between stereotypes and racism but this stereotype was eventually cast inappropriately.
21247,"Well... At some point they have to drop VTL, mask, TT right?"
21248,I guess SG'S non-chinese are immigrants 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
21249,"Furthermore, as an organization that aims to foster racial harmony and social cohesion, this response as resulted in people calling them cultural insensitive and bullying a minority for speaking up about racism and cultural insensitivity."
21250,The immigration policy is to help the companies not the citizens.
21251,Well..I guess people wanna see migrant workers throwing stones at our police judging from the downvotes.
21252,Well..those are literally called racism.
21253,"Putting a pre conceived idea of a person based on a biased view of their race is literally the definition of racism, and what’s more an ill intended one."
21254,Your HR buddy has a racist view even if he’s not hating.
21255,Welp it really is /s to think that VTL will be lifted next week
21256,I think I got that sentiment from the kind of Facebook people who hate immigrants all the time.
21257,"Now the actual, non-trivial cases of racism will become trivial thanks to ballooned scenarios like this."
21258,Nothing intentionally racist directed at me but local kids do tend to get preferential treatment from professors and peers.
21259,"When I first went there, the lid on my stewing pot of inherent racism just popped right off."
21260,Only white folks ever get accused of racism.
21261,Institutionalized racism is real and it’s something you just have to deal with.
21262,I usually kena scan cause I look like an Indonesian maid (I Malay lah)
21263,Western and westernised liberals have this weird idea that racism is best counteracted by education.
21264,"As is racism is naturally forbidden by the laws of nature, and if anyone just told these racist posters, ""you shouldn't be racist"", they'd go ""oh my, I never realised that Indians are human too until you told me, thanks"", and racism would be solved."
21265,"The hard truth is that while *unintentional* racism can be solved by education, this sort of wilful racism can't, and a free exchange of ideas will only let them organise themselves better and propagate their ideas."
21266,"There is nothing objective or natural about racism or anti-racism; both are subjective ideals, and if we want the latter to triumph, we need to actively promote it as a society."
21267,"It’s not just the constant loss of freedom, it’s the seemingly intentional alienation of the expat community through removal of LOCs, denial of EPs and travel restrictions."
21268,We’re mixing up two issues here: - more foreign talent stepping in to fill tech roles - unfair hiring practices particularly by certain groups   What minister here is exposing why there are more EPs including more from India  What people are concerned with is what is gov doing to clamp down on preferential hiring by nationality.
21269,"Just imagine all the maids in Tampines are from Philippines and none from other countries like Indonesia and Myanmar, most would assume something fishy is going on there."
21270,"We have to draw a clear line between legit concerns and those with racist intents that are hiring behind these concerns, but even more importantly we must not dismiss these concerns just because we are afraid of being accused as racist."
21271,We’re taking about the usage of word racism and you talk about actual racist policies and people’s appetite for racist policies.
21272,No question people were more racist back then.
21273,The meaning of racism is still consistent.
21274,The issue now is people are literally saying people are racist even when there is zero intent.
21275,"But when you’re brushing actual hateful racists that think Malays are subhumans with those who are ignorant and are willing to learn and be better, you end up looking vindictive and lessen the meaning of the word at best, or just make people less willing to actually learn from you and be better."
21276,We keep our migrant workers arguably seemingly shackled for 2 years due to Covid.
21277,"What I find annoying is that a lot of these people were silent on Social Media when there are other bad things happening at home or closer to home (construction workers living in messed up situations, general racism."
21278,"So earlier everyone labelled these girls as SPGs, but nowadays you see lots of mixed race couples where the girl is local, well educated and from a good family background and the guy is an expat."
21279,What I find funny is that if a bunch of angmo expats would decide to rent one of those small pickup trucks and throw themself in the back to go to a brunch place or wherever they would not make it more than 1km before they are stopped by police for breaching safety measures and deported.
21280,Agree on the too good a place for expats.
21281,And management award locals working together with equally trained foreign workers.
21282,"Expatriate contracts are tied to their home country, and then they are “sent over” as an expat worker for a finite period of time."
21283,"A foreign domestic worker is an adult, an employee, not a ""legal ward""."
21284,"What I said about illegal immigrants being non-white is factually true, so with immigration knowing this, they would not assume that he is trying to stay illegally?"
21285,"What I'm getting from this is: by tagging people under CMIO, the government can force people to mingle with other races rather than let each group form their own enclaves, is that right?"
21286,What I'm worried about is cause she left because of salary dispute so she may be trying to upset the new maid as well
21287,Which is why I treat my domestic helpers kindly.
21288,Just got out of  quarantine-lite after VTL arrival.
21289,"However, I am more than joyous to be back (no jeers please) and got back before VTL got cut."
21290,"I'd also answer any questions on my VTL process, if any."
21291,"Yes, I paid a shiny coin to get that VTL ticket but I'd do my share to help out Singapore Airlines."
21292,The domestic worker must have endured a hellish four years beholden by such thuggery.
21293,"&#x200B;  Seriously, the people who think SG is a Chinese country are just a bunch of retards like the recent racists in SG, or just about the whole swamp of CCP nationalists & their ignorant minions in West Taiwan."
21294,"What a generous thing to do, especially due to how affected the migrant workers have been because of Covid."
21295,Life as a foreign worker in Singapore is already fraught with enough uncertainties and anxieties; they need as much reassurance and welfare as they can get.
21296,What a hellspawn of a person that maid is..
21297,"Instead of everyone forgetting the incident, they have managed to renew the news cycle and not in their favor, amidst a time when Singapore is literally inundated with racist debacles."
21298,"As an Indian who grew up in Singapore for my first 18 years and then moved to the States, I experienced plenty of racist rhetoric and blatant ignorance by Singaporeans and almost none by Americans in my 7 years here."
21299,"I think if they had stated that they understood the positions of and travel restrictions implemented by the different countries, it would go a long way into building global trust in China."
21300,"What a sensationalised headline, I've never heard of such a teacher before but really, her arguments of Singapore being a racist country hinges on her secondary school class mates and a fucked up teacher."
21301,Also her only explanation that the racism issue in the US is better is that there are people of different races of people on TV?!
21302,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/nearly-half-of-large-dorms-breach-rules-each-year-minister  Just take away their dormitory licence and open up to the other half that can do well!
21303,I always love it when racist people try to justify themselves for not being racist.
21304,There aren't that many maids in Japan because Japanese women are much more likely than Singaporean women to be housewives or part-time workers.
21305,What about expats from other places of the world?
21306,We can’t assume expats are from the West by default.
21307,What about foreigners and expats then?
21308,By your definition it'll be racist.
21309,Maybe racism shouldn't be black or white like many other things in the world.
21310,What about the non-violent certified racist ppl?
21311,Humans need a sexual connection...and ...gasp.....so do foreign workers.
21312,I don't see local lasses from NUS and so on taking migrant males as lovers...nor straightlaced NS males asking maids out on dates.
21313,"So surprise surprise...yes, maid do have indian/bangladeshi boyfriends and they are doing a lot MORE than just standing around outside the malls."
21314,Being nice to migrant workers today does not make up for our lackadaisical attitude to them in the past.
21315,And how other countries treat their foreign workers should not be compared to how we treat ours.
21316,Ask a migrant worker for help and put their life at risk...
21317,And how do travel restrictions differ?
21318,What are some of the racist rants they get into?
21319,"What are the advices you can give for Sinkies who are afraid to throw away their red passport, because they are afraid like 'oh when you come back here to visit relatives, ICA will only give you 3 weeks visa' or 'you will get racism treatments, sure or not want to migrate?'"
21320,For crime cases it will be police for salary case or anything work related it is MoM for harassment and racist and bias treatment case it is police.
21321,"Numerous times, Singaporeans has expressed discomfort over CECA."
21322,What are the odds that after this we would actually rethink the way we treat our foreign workers?
21323,"What are the wild accusations of racism here, and why are they unwarranted?"
21324,"CCP Mainland Chinese can be racist against, other Chinese cannot?"
21325,"CCP didnt make racism against asians prevalent, tell that to the railroad workers back then in the US and Canada."
21326,I grew up there and would say its easier for Indians to assimilate though it's all still racist as fuk
21327,What are your thoughts on wether the UK could be added to Singapore’s travel restrictions?
21328,"CECA doesn't even provide for freedom of movement, people from India still apply for the same work pass"
21329,Going to a separate VTL trip to the EU and prices are very low also.
21330,Do these people get barred from employing domestic workers in the future?
21331,What did I sign up for when I answered the neighbor's housemaid whether I'm Indon or not while taking out trash.
21332,I've no clue about how maid employment here works and rights is reserved.
21333,Anw a lot of this kind of shit happens to our country too so usually the only way for the maid to save herself is *to fucking run away with the help of another maid*.
21334,"*godareyoutestingme*  I have no proof/statement that her employer is shit, but if she can oh boy I'll happily go down to any NGO that deals with maid's right :I   edit: just got home and reviewed her message."
21335,All these poor economically disadvantaged domestic workers are here to make a living.
21336,"What do u expect, when u have two bit opposition politicians dog whistling to such people hiding behind  CECA and what not ?"
21337,You are responsible for fanning racism.
21338,What do you do when your maid refuses to work and wants to be sent back to her home country?
21339,I hired a maid less than 2 months ago.
21340,Is that racist?
21341,What do you feel about all the racist and falsehood posts from the PAP though?
21342,What do you get when an unstoppable racist meet an immovable non-gentleman?
21343,That the govt has reduced restrictions in order to keep foreign workers here?
21344,What do you mean by CECA Indians?
21345,"Ironically the CECA agreement only says that in select professions, both governments can’t set limits on immigration like how the US government has set."
21346,Are they worse off than the immigrants from foreign countries that came to this country to find work?
21347,"Definitionally, something is racist if it makes a generalised statement, typically negative, against a race."
21348,it never stopped being xenophobic.
21349,"As long as terminology such as ""Ang mo"" and ""Gweilo"" are considered okay to use in referring to foreigners (by the majority of the population) Singapore will always be considered a xenophobic society."
21350,"Nobody is advocating racism or picking on foreigners, just suggesting that SAP schools include Malays and Indians."
21351,I wouldn't want a racist in my house
21352,What does the 'Caucasian foreign talents' have to do with this article you're referring to?
21353,What does the 2nd statement have to do with being skeptical about easing the travel restrictions between 2 countries?
21354,So I think easing the travel restrictions between the 2 countries would be the next logical step.
21355,Have they tested her with another maid?
21356,"Because I assume the maid eats together with your mom during breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc which is considered normal?"
21357,My boyfriend also hired a maid to take care of his mom.
21358,What domestic helpers to do just to get attention...
21359,What exactly is the problem with CECA?
21360,People here are throwing all kind of arguments but so far I don't see anything that sticks to CECA.
21361,"So on surface, the media is spinning this as racism."
21362,"So my frustration is, this ain't about racism."
21363,"What happened to ""Nobody is asking""  And i never said i deny the existence of racism nor think that it is a problem."
21364,what i reject is the attempt to explain racism using culture or social factors.
21365,What happened to that maid?
21366,"No matter how poor a family is, that is no excuse to illegally restrict the maid's freedom."
21367,"If maid employers want to pretend that maids are not their slaves, then they need to let the maids have a right to leave the country if he or she wants to."
21368,"You can't force them to keep working for you by confiscating their passports, no matter how disruptive or troublesome it is to find a new maid."
21369,What makes maid employers so special?
21370,Having a maid is not a right.
21371,Very few countries hire and abuse maids the way we do.
21372,"If employers can't even obey basic labour laws like not confiscating passports, then they shouldn't be hiring maids."
21373,Billions of people in other countries can raise families without maids.
21374,What has their official position got to do with whether it’s an act of racism or not?
21375,"I’m not contesting that it’s culturally insensitive, I’m saying what they did was not an act of racism, end of story."
21376,"If you continue to insist it is despite so many logical breakdowns on why it ISN’T, you are part of the plague that is undermining the real fight against racism."
21377,"Regardless of their official position, we should not readily equate cultural insensitivity to racism because that is an extremely slippery slope."
21378,"If you read the room, most people, including minorities (go read the FB post if you have doubts) do NOT think it was an act of racism."
21379,What has what's Xi is doing got to do with PRC immigrants?
21380,What he/she means is a slowdown in the rate at which new employment passes/PRs are given out
21381,"Its not just for orders, but also for people who are below your status, like maids, who are here in Singapore."
21382,Is that racist?
21383,How about I switch it up and she say “I prefer dating Malay guys because their house always smell nice” is that racist then?
21384,What if all the expats there were carriers?
21385,What if all these are for the future when sinkies become the foreign workers in singaoore?
21386,What if residents complained about domestic helpers using the facilities in the first place?
21387,"What if somebody argued that they cant put food on the table because the problem is no minimum wage and there should be higher taxes on megarich locals, but it isnt as much to do with CECA or foreigners?"
21388,Is Mahathir racist when he says Malays are lazy?
21389,"http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/12/21/malays-must-change-attitude-work-harder-economically/  Are Malay Studies researchers who find that Malays have different work attitudes to, say, Koreans racist?"
21390,What if the FDW is the one initiating sex?
21391,In that case the employer should have the power to accept or reject and the FDW is willing since she initiated it.
21392,"What if the employer allows the maid to use the facilities, isn’t it stupid that they have to be around?"
21393,Some people are totally oblivious to the fact that what they say can go down as being racist.
21394,"You should just counter it with something equally racist like, ""You Chinese all eat dog also right?"""
21395,"What do you weird posters mean when you say this post ""ain't going anywhere cause not enough ROI for SJW"" and things like ""someone say racist attacks can never be against Chinese""."
21396,"What is CECA, I really don’t know"
21397,What is an expat?
21398,What is it with people treating maids like slaves/ lesser human beings?
21399,What is it with singaporeans and maid abuse statistics.
21400,I'm from Brunei by the way and we don't treat maids like this.
21401,"What is racism, generally speaking (not only in Singapore)?"
21402,"IOW, a statement like ""because of their race"" is already deeply racist."
21403,Also housing is one of those things that you can't boycott because everyone needs a house and racism in the rental market is so rampant that it's very hard to find alternatives.
21404,There is no doubt that the latest outbreak has fuelled xenophobic sentiments but they were there before the latest outbreak.
21405,What is the actual difference between a designated VTL flight and regular fights?
21406,Do the VTL ones follow some stricter health protocols?
21407,"What is the difference between  A) Sgporean / PR fully vaxxed on SQ non-VTL flight back from France*; and  B) Foreigner fully vaxxed on SQ VTL flight back from France*  *Same flight routes, different designations   Answer: A has to do 7 day SHN  Please can someone explain to me how person A has a higher risk exposure being in the same ""safe"" country that warrants a 7 day SHN instead of a PCR test on arrival?"
21408,I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology.
21409,Subtle and casual racism is so subtle and casual that people don't even think much about it.
21410,What is the vaccination rate for migrant workers like?
21411,>80%) it doesn't make sense to confine them in dormitory and work sites while the rest of singapore continues to open up.
21412,What is the ~~opposition’s~~ foreign worker's job?
21413,"But supposing you had a ~~Parliament~~ country with 10, 15, 20 ~~opposition members~~ foreign workers out of 80."
21414,6.5 years for running over a maid and leaving her to die??
21415,Plus the fact that he went to repair his car tells us that he knows he hit the maid!
21416,"I was born in Malaysia, a country that's openly racist against Chinese people, and we live in a region where Chinese are the minority."
21417,We should not be worried about foreign workers?
21418,The amount of violence that maids get subjected to over here and elsewhere is truly horrifying.
21419,What is your family's ancestry and mother tongue?
21420,"Do people assume you're an expat if, say, you're in formal wear?"
21421,"That engineers are more likely to be racist, or...?"
21422,What kind of 12/13 yr old throw metal mugs at their maids.
21423,What kind of PPE was the 62 year old man wearing when he was at the Cochrane Lodge II dormitory?
21424,"Singapore is not squeaky clean when it comes to racism, but friction is mostly between chinese/indian/malay as well as now PRC chinese and India indians joining the fray."
21425,">MOM is literally issuing an advisory to specifically FDWs, because then it's easier for them to get the information."

21430,"We closed borders to the UK when B117 emerged, my friends in UK were like “Yeah mate, your gov did the right thing, it’s ****ed up over here” - Wasn’t racist was it?"
21431,"What makes me uncomfortable is that the ""commonly accepted metrics"" of racism, if I am interpreting correctly, will be determined by the majority."
21432,"Therefore, I feel for minority races that even in conversations about what is or is not racism, they face an uphill battles against the majority race who could not understand their perspectives in these issues."
21433,"That's why people on Reddit harp on CECA, foreign talents etc."
21434,Completely conceivable that the residents don’t want to share facilities with maids
21435,You think there's an exclusive job market for expat spouses only or something?
21436,It makes sense after awhile and I've begun to see even concerned expats at this point realise Singaporeans are on the losing end of alot of things.
21437,"As far as racism goes, it's rare."
21438,What racism did you experience in London?

21471,"Employers are against their FDWs having boyfriends because they know that the relationship cannot end in marriage and it’s just infidelity or premarital sex, leading to drama and security issues."

21474,"Your pathetic comment that the military is serving expats is utter nonsense as is your ""serve then talk"" and trying to infer I was not respecting members of the armed forces."
21475,What this optimisation left out may be the comprehensive development like socialising and other useful academic like mother tongue.

21478,That is racist.
21479,"If I say I want to hire Chinese workers, because they speak Chinese, that is a race based decision but it ISN’T racism even though I looked at the Chinese face and generalized and assume he speak Chinese instead of trying to confirm that Indians and Malays who applied don’t ALSO speak Chinese."
21480,"Those ""anti racist activists"" are doing more to help Chinese influence operations here than any Han Chauvinist can ever hope to achieve."
21481,"Also, one thing which I've been really curious about but am not sure if it might be a little insensitive: How do those relationships between the male foreign workers and female domestic workers (aka maids) work out in the end?"
21482,"It didnt stop them from hiring another maid, and it didnt flag them when they falsely accused the new one."
21483,The problem is that many people don't see this as a problem and don't admit they are racists and part of the problem.
21484,What's the definition used here for mid level expat?
21485,What's the difference between VTL flights and non-VTL flights nowadays?
21486,"Can't they just wind down the VTL flight and make everything non-VTL, rather than trying to expand the number VTL flights?"
21487,What's the purpose of VTL flights with \~20k daily cases nowadays anyway?

21492,What's the point in calling the agents racists when they have no say who the landlord wants to rent their property out to?

21499,"Someone has vouchers that they feel they will not utilize, what's wrong with giving it up to someone that may appreciate them better- in this case migrant workers who probably don't get a lot of chances to visit attractions because they may be expensive?"
21500,Trying to reason the uprise in posts about racism is just excusing racism.
21501,What's worst is the stereotype of foreign worker / maid hook-up.
21502,The only people who have problems with that are the ones who try to take advantage of domestic helpers.

21518,"Being called ""racist"" isn't a personal attack, it's a label on someone who exhibits the defined behaviour."
21519,"Whatever you want to call it (""racist"", ""cultural insensitivity""), I really don't see why PA should be this racially ignorant, seeing as they are (in their own words) an organization meant to promote racial harmony."

21567,Edit: Do not get mixed up between frustration & racism.
21568,"When it comes to openly racist hate speech, there's no such thing as freedom of speech and expression in Singapore."
21569,"When it comes to point 1 you cannot deny that Singapore has many cases of domestic helpers being abused and she even points out that its a human rights issue though i will agree that it is not always due to racism   Your point 2 is a bit of a mess    Point 3, neither you nor i have acted before so the norm outside Singapore could be that instead of telling a person ""hey are you okay with kissing a certain race"" they would instead ask ""hey are you okay with kissing that guy"" by asking race it would show that maybe the director thought the chinese actress wouldn't feel good kissing an indian actor instead of due to his race and not his person."
21570,"When making sense of claims made by the government/NGOs/media/activists/migrant workers, especially when they are competing, some questions that I think are clarifying are:  1) Are workers more likely to tell the unvarnished truth about their difficulties to social workers/activists they have a longstanding relationship with, or to politicians/people in power?"
21571,Has our government historically been honest in acknowledging migrant workers’ difficulties?
21572,Their testimonies are not meant to negate or undermine the efforts of volunteers and their painstaking efforts to provide food and other forms of care for migrant workers; they are meant to draw attention to the fact that the problems are far more deep reaching and maybe cannot be resolved merely through goodwill from charities and volunteers.
21573,When people are racist to you just be racist to them lol.
21574,"When racism and xenophobia is fueled by another force, you can’t simply “tackle racism”."
21575,It isn’t a simple case of racist/xenophobic mindset and all you need to do is change the mindset.
21576,"It’s worse when the government, their more fanatical supporters, and some of the “woke” crowd brushes off legitimate concerns over social issues as xenophobia and blame us for it."
21577,It doesn’t solve anything and it only repulses people from even discussing the topic of xenophobia.
21578,Why do you think people keeps stating that they are not xenophobic or racist before asking for more stringent border control?
21579,A lot of people know their concerns will be brushed off and painted as xenophobic.
21580,"The good thing is that many people, especially the ones here, are moderate enough to call out or dismiss the most ridiculous xenophobic rhetoric."
21581,"The frustrated common people should restrain themselves from being racist/xenophobic, as it is not acceptable and it isn’t going to make our concerns heard any better."

21583,When she says she's the hit the gym type but actually she just hits her maid.
21584,"When the government said they'd relax restrictions by Sunday, they just didn't specify that it was for migrant workers only (not sure if /s)."
21585,"When the racists feel empowered to be out there, we are in trouble."
21586,"When there is a will, there is a way; you have the privileges of writing while having access to the internet, rather than posting on Reddit about domestic helpers' issues, get downvoted with text brawls with others, volunteering your efforts with NGOs would yield better results."
21587,"Since you are into this issue, you may find inspiration from this American guy named Karl Anderson, who has set up a FB page to help abused Filipino maids in Saudi Arabia."

21599,When your own Singaporeans are treated like this it's hard to expect any kind of improvement for our foreign workers
21600,At least you can't deny a racist is better vaccinated than not.
21601,"Whenever someone's in danger and some random xenophobic singaporean asks what nationality, the only appropriate response is the use of CCS ""What is the point of this question"" meme."
21602,"Whenever these things get posted people show up with comments like ""but seventeen years ago our maid stole a packet of juice from our fridge so it's not just employers who are bad!"""
21603,Where are the stats for the number of people entering via VTL vs the number of people entering via non-VTLs
21604,"https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers  There are way more than 400K foreigners in the country, and the 400K figure is actually for PMET jobs, not FDW or CMP sectors."
21605,"They have their own room (bigger than the maids rooms I've seen in Singapore), T&B, and cable TV."
21606,I've heard of stories where the maids get treated like shit e.g.
21607,"I mean, sure some casual racism here and there but these are some horror stories."
21608,The filipino maids taking your job?
21609,Obvious racism is obvious.
21610,"Sure, they have the right I guess but it's still racism."
21611,Where does multicultural become xenophobic ?
21612,"A lot of the racism in Australia against Asians originates from the legacy of the ""Yellow Peril"", and ""Populate or Perish"" campaigns."
21613,"Let's put it this way, racism is discrimination against people of race, be it majority or minority."
21614,American's black discrimination is not equal in all parts to the racism experienced in Singapore.
21615,I am just using the exact same logic that you are using to make the point that generalization is not an excuse to dismiss racism.
21616,"Where is your source on the racist claim that Chinese immigrants here are less qualified than Malay, Indians or other ethnicities immigrants apart from your arse?"
21617,Where the chinese slaves or immigrants to Tanah Melayu?
21618,"What happened was the colonial powers divide and rule and effectively suppressed natives’ economic development (for fear of rebellion or worse, advancement/emancipation) whilst empowering chinese immigrants traders and gave the latter citizenship."
21619,"I'm sure that if there is a good reason for any disparity, the people who are not racists will have sound facts to back up their arguments againsts those who are."
21620,"(Keep that in mind) But in Singapore, most people have become tolerant of other races and thus, racism is a very rare occurence."
21621,"Whether it's lgbtism or racism, activism often lends a hand to its own discredit when it mixes facts, sensationalism and hyperbole."
21622,"Whether or not Sarah accused PA of racism is besides the point, and is just a red herring to distract from the huge boo boo committed."
21623,Whether someone is a maid or a nurse doesn't change the fact that what she did to a defenceless child was morally repugnant.
21624,Does the gov do what they do for the migrant workers solely because the gov cares about them?
21625,"If you were a migrant worker who has been stuck in lockdown for 15 months, surely you'd want a more definitive answer than soon™?"
21626,"With the high influx of immigrants settling down & having kids here, will eventually Vietnamese or Tagalog replace Malay/Tamil as Mother Tongues?"
21627,Which VTL  flight did you take from Turkey?
21628,I went to look at CECA.
21629,Which countries are they sourcing their FDWs from?
21630,"This way at least gives FDWs a chance to go home, and they don’t lose income during the SHN period."
21631,"That's a reasonable ask imo and while stricter than their previous posture, much less stricter than what we are asking for outside VTL and Cat 1."
21632,Which is also kind of a grey area because a domestic helpers work shouldn't involve intensive care of a senior - something a nurse is more qualified to handle and something he or she would be compensated more for.
21633,On your first point I'm vaccinated and I've tested negative but I still must do SHN despite returning From VTL approved country cos not on designated flight.
21634,And that is my point   Op said >CECA protocols only applies to intra company transfers  I said no.
21635,Maid or domestic helper?
21636,I can't help but feel domestic helper is just a politically correct phrase so their job is not so demeaning.
21637,"Anyway, I had a maid my entire life till I moved out at 30."
21638,Fucking red clothes)  I think the biggest impact on me having a maid for so long is the motivation to do chores.
21639,"Which is why alot of locals actually keep the maids passports to prevent them from running, even though its both legally and morally wrong to do so."
21640,"Totally not realistic because no foreign worker will be eating out of a styrofoam box like that, it simply does not hold enough rice."
21641,"> Singapore is more tourist/expat friendly which works for me, especially for my future retirement choice."
21642,Employers are not allowed to keep the foreign workers passport anymore.
21643,"While I agree about the losing control part, foreign media always make it sound like ordinary Sinkies are living well during this pandemic while the migrant workers are suffering."
21644,"While I agree that PA was not deliberately trying to be racist, they are, however, extremely incompetent, a waste of taxpayers monies just like their 5 jiak liao bee mayors, very arrogant, pushy and condescending, passive-aggressive in their PR communication, and are overall, like their paymasters in white, retarded, as reflected in the standee saga."
21645,"Name-calling and insulting minorities who are already hurt and slighted (regardless of whether PA was being racist or not, that's besides the point) is just icing on the cake."
21646,"in this case, providing shit living conditions to migrant workers to reduce operating costs), I think that for this one particular scenario, pushing all the costs (while rightfully so) to the dorm operators would only serve to harm the innocent parties, in this case the migrant workers."
21647,"While I agree that racism exists in Singapore, I think the incident you mention is also (emphasise: also before I get bashed when people think I'm saying it isn't racism) an issue of Singaporean's sense of moral and class superiority."
21648,I go on Twitter and see tweets calling out racism.
21649,It's never possible to remove racism.
21650,"(This will probably get downvoted because it doesn't go with the grain of 'reverse racism does not exist', but if you disagree, please drop a constructive discussion."
21651,"While I agree that that was the original intent having quota systems in itself is racist, and the bad side of this is that it can be used, and is being used as a way to discriminate against particular races."
21652,"But for the sake of illustration, the reality is that racism exists anywhere on the spectrum between systemic and ""casual"" in any society, without pegging your determination to some arbitrary standard."
21653,"There is systemic racism embedded in Singapore's domestic historiography which continues to impact the lives of minorities today, and it is even sadder that this has been so covertly normalized to be seen as non-existent."
21654,"To suggest that the residual ""casual"" racism in Singapore is excusable robs us of the chance to identify and correct the deficiencies in how our institutions might have have failed the minorities here, notwithstanding that the brand or racism here appears ""negligible"" compared to elsewhere."
21655,Don’t hire a maid if you can’t afford it.
21656,But you don’t get rich enough to hire a maid at 1k by being a nice person.
21657,"While I agree with many of the benefits that expats/foreigners bring to Singapore that you have mentioned, your penchant for glossing over individuals' own experiences/feeling that they were overlooked by the establishment's zealous protection of foreigners is very Trumpian-esqe."
21658,"Instead of saying you are arguing against simplistic slogans and cheap populist fixes (which I suspect you are going to label every opposing view as cheap populist fixes), how about coming up with solutions to address why people are becoming more xenophobic?"
21659,"I'm not saying it's right, but it may shine a light on why these racists are as upset as they are."
21660,"While I agree with your overall point that it is difficult to navigate the relationship with maids where it is very personal but yet still an employer-employee one and that boundaries need to be defined, the casual racism/classism/xenophobia coming through this post is very off-putting."
21661,"While I believe this is more of ignorance and  fuck ups from the PA staff than racism, this response is so horribly written."
21662,"While I cannot speak for others on this subreddit, I for one am against racism and any act of discrimination, and all of such actions should indeed be called out - such as the poly lecturer who had no right in even starting a conversation about who a random stranger on the street can and cannot date."
21663,But the direction that this subreddit is heading towards seems to be a case of calling each and every single altercation that happens against a minority race an act of racism.
21664,"While racist assholes do exist, and they do perpetuate acts of racism, not every thing is inherently racist just because the other party is a minority race."
21665,"Also, students should not have to be denied MTL education in their own (actual) mother tongue in order to have access to better education."
21666,"While I do not doubt her sincerity and her sources in trying to highlight the issues faced by the dormitory workers, at which point do we draw a line at foreign interference in local politics?"
21667,"The lazy malay for example, is an enduring example of casual racism in Singapore  ""to be honest how often you heard someone saying they are ""Singapore Chinese"", or ""Singapore Malay"" etc etc.. we just said we are Singaporean and that's good enough""  I don't think this is really true."
21668,"While I don’t hire a maid, not ordering for them at a restaurant can be due to dietary restrictions for the maid."
21669,"Why y’all downvoting me lol if i’m non-muslim and my maid is muslim, do i make her eat the food at a non-halal restaurant?"
21670,"If every country looks at stats like the most jobless, the most in prison as a ratio to their population, the most poor sector as evidence of systemic racism."
21671,"Then every country will be ""racist"" towards their struggling minority liao."
21672,And that's probably because their community are more focus on studying and work than anything else instead of being involve in crime and then crying racism on police for going after them.
21673,"Don't tell me those actions of his were racism of the police, like the police is targeting him for absolutely nothing."
21674,"While I support LMW's challenge on the CECA issue, I very much disagreed with him singling out Gupta as an example."

21863,"But its okay, I’ve grown up, Its better to help other people who kena now by these racist boomers etc."
21864,Why would I think it’s funny that racism exists?
21865,I think your reaction to specify what kind of racism is funny.

21882,>Singapore is structurally racist  Are you sure you want to keep digging this hole?

21924,"Also I would like to remind you that racism, xenophobia, and personal attacks are not welcome in this sub or in r/Malaysia, nor are attempts to incite such behaviour from others (i.e."
21925,Have you faced such harassment or racist behaviour?
21926,"With the recent thread about the Mustafa staff not being able to speak English, and also given the less-locally relevant but somewhat tangentially related #stopHindiImposition hashtag that's been trending in India (where non-Hindi speakers are expressing distaste for a suggestion that would mandate Hindi education in states where the mother tongue was something else - like Tamil or Malayalam for instance), I figure it's a good time to bring this point up again."
21927,I'm also curious to hear from people who simply have English as their mother tongue and don't speak anything else at home.
21928,"With the spate of racist incidents gaining national attention, do you think our leaders or leader should make a national address to clearly articulate the governments position on this, and what they intend to do?"
21929,"Does that suggest that someone unfamiliar with Hispanics, or Alaskan Islanders, or Azerbaijanis, is somehow racist?"
21930,"But that doesn't mean that people who don't reach your standard, and are supposedly ""willfully ignorant despite the opportunities"" are somehow racist."
21931,"With the domestic helper, her job is to take away this problem from the couple and that's what she is being paid for."
21932,With their own FDW?
21933,Other FDW?
21934,"With this change, are domestic workers allowed to visit family in the Philippines and not have a hard time coming back?"
21935,"Without Jolovan's advocacy (much of which is closed door with MOM alongside what you see outside) we very likely would not have the Foreign Employees Dormitories Act, the Human Trafficking Act, the Trafficking-in-persons task force, mandatory off day for maids, and a whole lot of other advances in workers rights in Singapore."
21936,"Without a racist intent, this is not racism, this is just race/culture insensitivity."
21937,"If we just stick to shouting ""racism"", bay for blood (sack the person, shame the person, jail the person), ask yourself if such society is going to get more gracious or more polarised along cultural and racial fault lines."
21938,"Without locals willing to work in these industries, no Singapore can not rely less on foreign workers."
21939,"Drawing this kind of nuance regarding subjective intentions of the perpetrator is artificial and shouldn't be the defining aspect of racism, which should be victim-centric."
21940,"In other words, ""I didn't know this was a racist act"" can be reasonable at times, but it shouldn't make the act not a racist act."
21941,To reconcile racist and racially insensitive - I would say that a racially insensitive act is one kind of racist act done without intention to be racist.
21942,"Woah there Sir, brace yourself for the massive downvotes from the maid-owners ""but I treat my maids right!"
21943,"Here is an interview on a Bangladeshi who lives in one of those dormitory, claiming he gets paid SGD1500 to 1800 a month."
21944,"But in SG, how do FDWs get treated by locals?"
21945,Then tens of thousands of cases began to emerge in dormitories for migrant workers.
21946,Won't be surprised if some of them are already brainwashed since young by their xenophobic parents.
21947,Won't disclose much but about 75% of my neighbours in the condo I live in are expats.
21948,Won't such open and blatant racist incident heightens CCP's resolve to accelerate their mission to show the world that they will not allow zipperhead to happen again?
21949,Wonder what was going through her(the maid) mind.
21950,"Wonder why only mainland Chinese talents here, not Malaysian / Indonesians / Thais/ Indians in “meritocracy” and “foreign talents” mentioned in article."
21951,"Wondering what went through the employer's mind when the maid took the laptop to hit her: ""noooo not the laptop!"
21952,Wont rent because of the cooking smell is so stupid and you really think its not because of racism?
21953,"Similar to how Females are physically less capable to Males due to genes and bodily structure, Black people are noted to be poorer than white people on average - but we *know* that such problems are caused due not because of Genetics, but because of the environments and institutional racism that crippled people of colour till modern times."
21954,"** Take the Bumiputra policy of a Malay-first Malaysia, for example - to equalize the Economic differences between Malays and Chinese, the Malaysian government puts Malays into an institutional advantage (at least, in Public Rationale)... and I’m sure you agree its an awfully racist policy that isn’t turning out well for the Malays."
21955,"This is an even closer comparison to the Bumiputra Analogy, as it’s doing exactly what we want to do - eliminate institutional racism."
21956,"But we see the results of such a movement, no matter how courageous and genuinely good-hearted the movement is - it’s putting the racial distinction you wish to eliminate on a pedestal, and it’s only strong enough to support eliminating institutional racism, not the very concept of race distinctions itself."
21957,"Now, I personally think that Social Media has accelerated the ability for such topics to be wider understood and discussed, and to accelerate the awareness that racism, indeed, continues to exist, and thus generate activism to eliminate these elements of hatred and vitriol."
21958,I don’t doubt that you grew up in an environment where you observed racists.
21959,"I myself have grown up in a family of racists - Aku-neh-neh and “don’t go close to them” are phrases from my loved ones that sit close to my heart, and I have to sadly admit that they are so deeply rooted I find myself having to fight my urge to discriminate against the stereotypical Indian individuals who have grown in numbers over the internet with their often-suboptimal English and attitude."
21960,"That being said, I am aware of this and I make the active notion to fight this despite being a rather emotional person, despite growing up in this environment of deep-rooted racism."
21961,"We only know the fact that racism=bad, because judging by skin=bad - this discussion on why such differences appear comes later, if at all, but we understand racism=bad as closely as we do 1=1."
21962,"That’s why racists tend to be lower-class, financially-disadvantaged... because they don’t have the environment some of us were lucky to have."
21963,"And I sure hope that these learning environments can continue to mature and multiply, so that the environment of racism elimination can grow to foster a world where we can genuinely minimise this."
21964,"The expat management loves it here, not sure what you're doing wrong exactly."
21965,"Govt, developers, construction companies, and the eventual owners of the property have to take ownership of the responsibility of the safety of our migrant worker’s lives."
21966,There must be a better mitigation avenue for domestic helpers.
21967,Really doubt that VTL would be anytime soon though
21968,World class local banks filled with CECA in CBP
21969,"\- this is entirely stupid, but don't use the word ""expat"" too much here, as it is often associated with richer (usually white) guys sent by their head offices to work in Singapore."
21970,"See I studied so hard in PSLE, of course now I must have a maid."
21971,"I make 6k after 15 years working for gahman so obviously i deserve a maid and obviously I can afford one”  If the people with so much can’t even extend their hand to people with less, then what hope is there for the rest of us?"
21972,Would be fun to see how the people who were anti-pap and angry that the government spent money on the migrant workers respond to this
21973,Would have said to watch a compilation of racist things lky said during his time
21974,Would he be acting the same way if the passenger wasn't a FDW?
21975,Would it be racist if my school decided we need a Malay head prefect bcos we haven't had one for many years and we need a good representation of all races?
21976,Would it even cover for domestic workers though?
21977,I'm curious what kind of things really went down in those racist towns.
21978,Would you like to educate the rest of us on your definition of racism?
21979,Would you mind sharing some of this casual racism you've mentioned?
21980,Would you plan to return to Singapore via VTL??
21981,"Despite the VTLs, overseas travel is currently still a privilege for most Singaporeans."
21982,"I've read that compared to SG, HK:   \- has more nature  \- is more chaotic  \- has comparable rent but smaller living spaces  \- has less adoption of English as a lingua franca  \- is more difficult for english-only speaking expats to find work  For what it's worth, my partner and I absolutely adore HK and are currently scouting that as our #1 option with SG as a second choice and BKK/KL roughly tied as runner-ups."
21983,Wouldn't the problem be just...differences in ideology...instead of *racism*?
21984,"Reminds me when the Irish and Italian immigrants emigrated to the states in the early 20th century and after WW2, they were discriminated against by their fellow countrymen who were 2nd or third generation Americans, and of course the Brits/Americans."
21985,Wouldn’t be shocked to see a few VTL’s go down in the coming days.
21986,"Wow I agree with you it would be great if Singapore can be benevolent, gracious and charitable to the less fortunate, and the foreign migrant workers."
21987,"Wow I remember when the case first emerged on ST, the toxic FB commenters were slamming the maid left right centre."
21988,Wow a few cases of maid abuse = fascist society.
21989,Wow blatant racism.
21990,It’s the travel restrictions.
21991,"Wow even so, why wouldnt maids be allowed in the pool?!"
21992,If I said all locals are xenophobic would it be OK ?
21993,">Used for explicitly xenophobic reasons in USA  Firstly, having a measurable system with requirements stated clearly is better thanour current closed system with no explanations given."
21994,Wow racist
21995,"I was closer to my grandma's maid and would do every kid thing with her, like play with toys, talk about stuff, watch shows and go to the park for walks sometimes."
21996,Wow this guy is a bigot and probably a maid abuser.
21997,"It's a legit question why discriminatory measures are necessary whether for migrant workers or anti vaxxers, when it's doing absolutely nothing to stem covid now   Measures should be put in place to manage the covid situation, not to install a useless caste system."
21998,"Wow wow wow, don't you realize there are very real practical implications and considerations tied to ensuring foreign workers' safety?"
21999,"I get tonnes of racist comments, the most common is the ching chong ding dong things from Australians."
22000,I think a lot of racist remarks are so wide off the mark that they sound so unintelligent that I don’t even wanna bother stooping to their level.
22001,That’s r/technicallythetruth  Heartbreaking that working mums need to help pay for extra classes for their kids which their maid actually is the one fetching them when most of the “chit chat” happens.
22002,"It's funny but when I first got so frustrated on Propertyguru (few days before I made this post), I actually googled ""rental racism in singapore"" and your article was the 1st or 2nd hit on google."
22003,"You said you don't see how having a lot of chinese immigrants in our country is a problem, i do have an answer for that but it may be more racists than I would like so I won't explicitly state it here and keep it to myself."
22004,"Wow, I'm right, you keep repeating the point that I don't care about the maid's mistreatment."
22005,The way Ng Jia Sheng treats a poor maid is indicative of his poor character and low suitability for any workplace.
22006,"Wow, congrats on being super racist!"
22007,"Wow, did you actually just say that the meaning of the term ‘racism’ changes depending on where you’re from?"
22008,"A simple search of ""IQA"" on the careers future page surfaces this racist company quite easily."
22009,"As a foreign worker, I'm curious, how much (in percent) of the local population would you say have that mindset?"
22010,"Wow, my mum would have killed me first before even shouting at my maid."
22011,"I think like someone else commented, we should have people to speak up, and we need to agree what is racism and what is not."
22012,"I mean if lack of hygiene was the main cause then there should be way more cases of outbreaks of food poisoning within migrant workers in the past right, which would have sounded off alarms about the conditions they were in and prevented this."
22013,"The large majority of the time, it is used in a condescending and racist manner."
22014,I would caution against normalising casual racism.
22015,"Tell me, that's not racist."
22016,"The ah neh term also is derived from the racist **ah** puh neh **neh**, where racists justify its usage like you do, saying that it's the direct translation for older brother while masking its true intent."
22017,Might wanna see [this](https://sea.mashable.com/article/7134/chinese-girl-loves-ahneiii-food-and-people-are-calling-her-racist) and [this](https://mustsharenews.com/apu-neh-derogatory/) too.
22018,"Wow, only 5 hours of sleep, that's psychological torture as well, keeping the maid unfocused and weak - unable to escape."
22019,"Wow, so just to close the VTL completely?"
22020,"Wow, that cover photo is racist."
22021,"Wow, that maid is fucked up."
22022,"I had a Filipino maid who, before she left, took with her many of my nicest clothes."
22023,"I lived in London before moving here, and I agree with what you are saying, that racism carries a negative stigma, therefore, racists are alienated in most social groups, and i don't find that to be as strong here in Singapore.. Not that I really have a huge insight from living here a long time, but my first impression matches your comments."
22024,If they had they would have charged the employer for the earlier incidents as the maid was working for the employer even then.
22025,What an unfortunate turn of events for the maid.
22026,"""Dont tell me keep CECA but have minimum wage, PAP wont do any of it""."
22027,What I really take offence to here is the equation of the expatriate experience with that of the migrant worker.
22028,"Market forces apply and as stated in the article, even where the person interviewed contemplates leaving singapore, there is a serious consideration because singapore appears to be highly competitive as an international hub and for the manner of expatriate living experience."
22029,"This seems like some real ""The Handmaid's Tale"" shit, but like the opposite."
22030,Then you are an expat technically.
22031,He could be the busiest racist in the world.
22032,You know foreign workers book in and out everyday?
22033,Would have been so uplifting to hear this news if not for the fact that migrant workers before this were treated more like cattle and support was mostly reliant on good Samaritan volunteers.
22034,Allowing maids to have 24 hours off is too much to ask for?
22035,Allowing more space and livable conditions for foreign workers is too much to ask for?
22036,The kind who aren't marginalised by expats in their own country.
22037,"While I agree with OP  that conditions could be improved for foreign workers (seriously what the fuck are you doing MOM), the hyperbole that Singaporeans advocate slavery is ridiculous because slaves are well, slaves and these people are sacrificing themselves for the long con which is the amazing exchange rate of SGD - Home currency."
22038,Wrong:  [https://www.ined.fr/en/everything\_about\_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/france-fertility-level-no-immigrants/](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/france-fertility-level-no-immigrants/)
22039,No wonder Indonesia wanted to stop sending their maids abroad.
22040,Wtf are you even going on about this guy was not following the law and went on an unnecessary racist tirade knowing he was being recorded.
22041,The court literally passed the judgement saying that the maid was innocent of the family's accusations right?
22042,Funny how a foreign worker can lose his job when the employer pass any fast judgement.
22043,"You don't think singapore has ""real"" racism?"
22044,"What is ""real"" racism according to you?"
22045,That's fking racist.
22046,"So to all races, don't assume only majority race are racist."
22047,Even the minority races can be racist.
22048,"Wtf, you racist ah."
22049,"Be careful J n E. J is on employment or S pass, also involved in a lot of maid malpractices as girl fren is maid agent."
22050,J is also going to be maid agent.
22051,"X-Post referenced from /r/china by /u/educo_   [Taiwan ranks #1 in Top Expat Destinations; China, #48 according to Expat Insider 2016 survey [PDF]](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/51jxw0/taiwan_ranks_1_in_top_expat_destinations_china_48/) *****      ^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot."
22052,"XX's video post [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrg-T950nhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrg-T950nhE)     Shrey explaining himself:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rd\_Cpi0O1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rd_Cpi0O1c)   If Shrey was the first one to point out that the director was being racist, and XX voiced her opinion on why she thinks the director/production team was not racist - that's fine."
22053,Since people *can* express their opinions wrt Shrey's post against his claim that the director for ABTM was racist.
22054,"Xenophilic means foreinger-loving, not a typo for xenophobic."
22055,Am I xenophobic in that sense?
22056,"And yeah I'm xenophobic (Xenophobia is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange), but I don't hate on most foreigners."
22057,Racial riots among Singaporeans (back when Singapore had self-independence in 1959) doesn't necessarily constitute xenophobic behavior.
22058,Xenophobia is xenophobia.
22059,Same goes for racism or sexism.
22060,That is not xenophobia.
22061,Xenophobia/racism is a real issue that needs to be handled.
22062,The issues don't just end there either...  look at the disgusting views held against migrant workers... they build the future of Singapore while ungrateful people look down upon them.
22063,"Both of these people have charities for support, where even migrant worker ones even have campaigns to educated the public...   My own flatmate on top of being against the vax, also blames migrant workers for covid with baseless allegations and misinformation."
22064,Isn't that a little ironic when it's an expat forum?
22065,Xenophobic = racist  Xenophonic = stealing our national anthem?
22066,It's more racist since I don't want their majority to prosper.
22067,Xiaxue has always been pretty racist throughout the years.
22068,Xiaxue probably never gets arrested for her racist tweets because the Police are unable to identify her face from her IC photo
22069,"it was about her racist tweets, one including something about a lot of Bangladeshis in Jurong East?"
22070,"The disturbing part was the maid was telling me ""sir (her son) said need change to expensive medicine."
22071,Then dont hire a maid.
22072,"YESSSS   These bloody hipsters are the same ones who were silent about the migrant workers, the rohingyas, about marginalization of our own minorities in Singapore."
22073,Even if they completely ignore 1 million foreign workers because they are nobody so who cares right?
22074,Doesn't help that most expats prefer living centrally vs further out of the city so competition to get into local schools is higher
22075,"Ya I have seen this many times in places with mixed workforce, all expats and foreigners go for drinks but the locals 'I'm allergic to alcohol', 'sorry can't tonight' or similar excuse, this is not the situation in other countries such as philippines or korea, they all LOVE alcohol."
22076,"Ya because in the 2 years since Wuhan we have not had any variants, outbreaks, border measures or collected any data."
22077,Ya but most maids will be more afraid of their employers who can choose to terminate their contracts then they'll be jobless....
22078,"Ya but now you’re conflating bullying with racism, which are still different things."
22079,And if other people from other race + the people from the race saying it's not okay then doesn't it show that the people from the other race is empathetic and not a racist?
22080,Malaysia racist doesn't mean Singapore no problem already right?
22081,Im so sorry to my Malay and Indian friends for my elders' racism.
22082,"The only racism I've spoken about is the way people use the word ""CECA"", basically directing all your ire about FTs taking jobs towards Indians."
22083,You think white expats aren't doing the same?
22084,"I living in another country now, and these kind of developments make me worried about whether the governments in both SG and here will suddenly re-assess their travel restriction plans because of these cases."
22085,She was probably surprised because she had already warned the maid that her house is big.
22086,"However, the maid might not have given the real reason because the employer was around or it was not socially acceptable to bad mouth about your ex employer."
22087,"Not in the good way that helps the maid improve, in the rather unreasonable way."
22088,Could the employer not wash the clothes herself or soak it in a pail and let the maid wash the next day?
22089,It's good that she warned the maid.
22090,"The maid was getting about the same pay as her peers, but cleaning a lot more area than some of her peers."
22091,Against domestic worker at home.
22092,I still have racism thought on most first encounter.
22093,It is only when I re-think myself that I should not have racism towards them.
22094,Yah and the foreign workers had to wait so many hours before they even receive any assistance.
22095,"Singapore translates Ebola as 伊波拉, but sometimes they use the China translation 埃博拉。 Not being xenophobic or anything, many channel 8 Chinese reporters come from China as we lack Singaporean Chinese talents."
22096,"Oh, and maids."
22097,Are you going to work as a maid for $500 a month?
22098,Dont the concerns of expats within our community matter as well?
22099,"And it seems like yall are generalizing all foreigners.. im not even an expat, but im triggered."
22100,Ye it's disgusting how some people treat their maids like as if they aren't even human.
22101,"Ye true, racism is everywhere, its human nature to blame others, and generalise out of fear, but we should try our best to hold it in, the country would be a slightly better place if people just held in their feelings and bad thoughts sometimes."
22102,"It’s not racism because people don’t pay more for the same quality of work and all things being equal, but just more money for German."
22103,"Yea I believe it started after the forum got a lot of heat over racism and doxxing in recent years, after which they couldn't use the more traditional terms like 'ahneh'."
22104,"Using [CECA](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/singapore-ftas/ceca) turned out to be the more appropriate term for hating on Indian nationals, as it excluded Singaporean Indians (who were previously clubbed under blanket race-terminology like 'ahneh' 'kling' etc)"
22105,&#x200B;  NP you can also see many non-Chinese students; so I also don't fucking know how he of all people can be the guy to openly and proudly show off his racism lmao.
22106,Yea I think most parents would not leave the discipline to the maids and do it themselves.
22107,"But in my case, because, both my parents, are hands off parenting, and leave 100% to the maid."
22108,"So I consider my maid an ""out sourced mother""."
22109,"Interestingly, the maid before this also had 10 years with the family, but I was living with grandparents and happily there, so I didn't really know her, but my younger brother was brought up from baby by her and seem to have a really good relationship too."
22110,"By the time I moved back to my parents, the previous maid was leaving and the new one, was the wonderful one that I was close to."
22111,Stop lying and propagating falsehood that CECA has nothing to do with hiring.
22112,Yea because singapore society still have some racism.
22113,I know reddit is not representative but there are some recent posts that highlight racism experienced by our fellow non Chinese minorities.
22114,If you treat your citizens like we treat our migrant workers.
22115,I personally don't think its racist.
22116,Yea for me it was insane she doesn't think the maid deserves a good meal.
22117,"Talks about the maid threatening to eat instant noodles..., um...., it's like..., I was even confuse if she is upset her maid wants to eat her instant noodles."
22118,Yea haha CECA seems to be just a scapegoat for the root issue: what levels of immigration in different skill sectors are we prepared to accept?
22119,"Yea he thinks sexism is fair, but racism is unfair."
22120,"Yea honestly, I think that I would have a lower chance of getting COVID in a ranch or mountain home in the middle of nowhere in any of the countries that we have a VTL with."
22121,"Like I wouldn't mind admitting that my dad/uncle/aunt are racist against Indians here thanks to their outdated boomer mindset, but just because they are, doesn't mean that me (an SG Chinese & racial majority in SG), or every other SG Chinese you see in the street or McDonalds outlet, exhibit the same racist tendencies as they do."
22122,"Personally I am in a few family whatsapp groups, and have some racist aunties blaming these FW for making SG look bad in the international stage.. Wow just shut the fuck up bitch, you nasty!"
22123,I reported that comment because it was blatantly racist.
22124,"Yea maybe its racism but then again if its my property which i bought with my own money, surely i get to choose who i want to rent it to?"
22125,"Yea she definitely ain't a maid, probably meant it as tongue in cheek to those who called her one"
22126,Yea thats what i figured until or even if Thailand gets onto the VTL.
22127,"Yea way to go, always the “institutional racism” and the whole system is against a single race thing."
22128,Because Chinese is majority here so the percentage of racism in Chinese people might feel high.
22129,"But every race got their racists,i doubt in a whole earth's life span we gonna get rid of them."
22130,"So the laws need to be mindful sometimes, how it could be abuse by employers, when the balance of power is so imbalance, like the entire maid's fate is solely at the employer's mercy."
22131,"But for a maid...., it's like...., the worst kind of hell if they were unlucky."
22132,VTL lanes open now!!
22133,"I admit it, foreign workers are not one of the major groups that I am concerned about."
22134,"That's why Japanese love to be assigned to SG, they are treated like kings with their expat package."
22135,"Yea, this issue has been discussed here on a number of occasions and it has almost always devolved into accusations of racism and what not."
22136,We are only paying foreign workers low because we can and because it’s been happening for decades.
22137,"Anyway, I would still stand by my views that if people are out here continuing to defend these racist ways, you agents will always run the risk of being blamed."
22138,"I would be upset and hope such racism doesn’t happen but at the end of day, it is their private property and it is how it is."
22139,At least some agencies let their maids chat or read...
22140,"Yeah I always secretly judged my friends that said that because my family used to hire maid and I could tell that my mum still respected her as a human and didn't coop her up in my home, paid her bonuses for going the extra mile and generally kept her content."
22141,"Although eventually, that maid crossed the line and started getting lazy."
22142,Yeah I always wanted to have the expat life.
22143,"In the dating sense, racism is usually just an avoidance of cultural clashes, which in a way is perfectly understandable."
22144,I've seen LGBT anti-racism woke Twitter/reddit people proper racist against asians.
22145,There are people that don't support woke culture but are not racist and vice versa.
22146,"Yeah I don’t get it, if the maid fled wont the maid agency cancel her work permit?"
22147,"We have mexicans we treat similar to the way you treat brown immigrants, but in the cities on the coasts people are pretty much equal."
22148,"People are different in this city, San Fransisco, and San Diego, if you go to other states the people suck, especially the middle of the country, people are racist, xenophobic, uneducated, ignorant, very religious and judgemental, etc."
22149,Yeah I think xenophobia against any kind of foreigner of any race is toxic and definitely detrimental to our multiracial/multicultural identity.
22150,I’m definitely against any kind of xenophobia (against mainland Chinese included) and I hate it when Singaporeans act as though we’re culturally superior or somehow higher-class than them.
22151,Overheard quite a bit of casual racism from the higher-ups.
22152,I like it here but the travel restrictions for family reasons are too painful.
22153,"But if you look at the comments of the post, you can see all these 'employers' saying that they would immediately fire their maids if they had boyfreinds."
22154,it almost seems scarily like these maids are somehow their 'children' that they need to have total control over.
22155,"Yeah I’ve taken this to heart and call out not only racist incidents but also errant cyclists, smokers, people who walk while texting etc."
22156,"Yeah OP, excuse our racism and adopt our racist views."
22157,Yeah PAP’s response that Singapore isn’t ready for a non-Chinese PM is a good start to reduce racism.
22158,The person denouncing “racist attacks” but at the same time saying singapore isn’t ready for non-Chinese PM.
22159,"Has to do with them growing up with maids and looking at foreign (bengali) workers cleaning the streets and their parents saying ""If you don't study you'll end up like them""."
22160,"Hence, I'm an expat on my way out as of a week ago."
22161,"Yeah and maybe I was just lucky, I live in Boston where I go to school, and occasionally go down to NYC, but I guess there's a higher chance of encountering racism when you cross paths with a greater number of people everyday"
22162,"Yeah and these people say the same things as racist Westerners when you alert them of their behavior,  'Oh but I have Malay/Indian/Mainland Chinese friends'  'It's not racist, it's just stating a fact'  I think we just gotta be more honest with ourselves and not keep sweeping every problem that doesn't fit into our picture-perfect harmonious Singapore, under the damn carpet."
22163,And you just exposed that you have the very same racist mindset that you are calling out the Westerners for.
22164,"Instead of calling majority for being racist at not recognising a small incident as being painful, it’ll be more educational to explain how the micro aggression build up."
22165,Your rank-and-file expat colleagues won't get anywhere near that amount.
22166,"Yeah but Singaporeans have to serve NS and/or actually contribute to Singapore from young, unlike expats who can choose to stay for the least period of time."
22167,Yeah but not to a black expat.
22168,"I fear that our society is evolving towards to the kind of westernised overly PC mentality and anyhow use phrases like ""casual racism""."
22169,"They said that she ""shared claims"" that the incident ""perpetuate\[s\] the racist culture""  We have to read the relevant part of PA's statement in full."
22170,"However, **Ms Sarah has shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”**."
22171,She characterised this incident as “racist”.
22172,"In her interview with Walid J. Abdullah, she also insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”."
22173,"** While the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist."
22174,"It is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments."
22175,"So a few things that can be noted:  a) PA says ""this incident ""perpetuate the racist culture""."
22176,"b) However what was actually shared was ""This whole thread is written with much labour, can we Chinese Singaporeans please appreciate the labour and **educated ourselves on our conditioned racism**?"
22177,"It's long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with **our ignorance - which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them**""."
22178,"c) Taking the above at face value, the phrase ""*which continues to perpetuate the racist culture*"", and in particular the word ""*which*"" can only refer to either (a) our conditioned racism, or (b) our ignorance."
22179,"d) So at our face value analysis, the claim that ""*Ms Sarah has shared claims that this incident ""perpetuate the racist culture*"" does not pass muster."
22180,"The point was not made against ""this incident"", but rather the conditioned racism or ignorance of Chinese Singaporeans."
22181,"e) After making the comparison in paragraph 3, PA goes on the generally refer to everything in paragraph 3 as ""***these are accusations we reject... it is not right to raise the allegation of racism***""."
22182,"The point on ""*racist culture*"" was not (i) an accusation against PA and PA cannot reject an accusation made against someone else; (ii) the point was on the perpetuation of a racist culture, which is a specific point that is different from a general ""*allegation of racism*""."
22183,"They have taken a shared post that is directed towards Chinese Singaporeans, and changed it into an allegation of racism against the PA itself."
22184,Yeah but you don't need to be malicious to be racist man.
22185,"When shan says it, the racists just see it as an indian backing one of his own"
22186,Yeah can't help but notice the influx of articles about how expats have it tough.
22187,"Yeah definitely, thats why I got say younger gens of Singaporeans are more xenophobic than racist if they do hold any discriminatory feelings"
22188,"But also racist people don't always make sense, so idk"
22189,Not all racists wear white gowns and conical hats like a bad stereotype.
22190,In sg the stereotypes surrounding indians are pretty negative and I’ve experienced far more racism in sg than in the US.
22191,"But even studying there, racism, for them is just surface level."
22192,I have a tendency to believe because i had a maid whose agent taught her to run away back to agency if her request for transfer is not met.
22193,Yeah it makes sense in that we gotta protect our own as we are all immigrants.
22194,Yeah it would need to be designated VTL flight.
22195,"SIA VTL page already indicated they would handle VTL flight, just the schedule/which flight hasn't been finalised yet."
22196,I'm just booking and would change the date if it is not VTL.
22197,Yeah it's a toxic combination racism and xenophobia.
22198,"So even though data showing expats have been leaving, the 2.5k-5k section of the market quite supported."
22199,I have a friend in Singapore who has a maid and she was very angry the maid bought a phone with the out permission.
22200,Yeah it’s all because of those 50 foreign workers who were allowed to roam around little India for 4 hours  Btw “pressurised” hospitals lol
22201,"I always hear to always be on guard and so much racism between black people and white people, then there’s when I was constantly told excuses on why I couldn’t be pushed up to management and had people with the same “problems” get pushed up without even asking when I worked harder."
22202,"Also people will have to stop being outright racist, at least."
22203,He is racist and should be charged (he should be charged for the assault alone in any case)
22204,Back in India Bihari migrant workers from the North get treated in South India as if they're all inherently illiterate thugs and rapists and Malayalee or Tamil people living in the North get stereotyped as oily *Madrassis*.
22205,"Australia closed their borders to India, does that make them racist too?"
22206,Yeah let's discriminate against racists and xenophobes!
22207,"Fuck you all, even though it's a kid saying those stuff it's still racism."
22208,Yeah man they should do kids at home vs maids 🤡
22209,"Yeah man, I’ve seen lots of research saying that expats can’t carry the virus, so they definitely can’t spread it to the high risk (local) population that can’t be vaccinated."
22210,"Yeah man, most countries transport livestock to slaughter the way people transport migrant workers here"
22211,Yeah many racist fucks.
22212,Also people using racist/degratory words with no chill in this thread..........
22213,"Yeah maybe I am the problem and I am racist, right?"
22214,Maybe I am racist?
22215,"Maybe I am a racist, but guess what?"
22216,"Oh yes, and I dare to tell you that, there are much more racist people out there, and go ahead and be your SJW."
22217,Yeah most racist people can control it in more public settings.
22218,"(In Eastern Europe it’s a different story though, they treat me differently from my bf, racism is also very rampant and open there sadly)."
22219,Yeah my sister has a maid for more than 10 years to take care of my 2 nieces and our handicapped old man.
22220,"The maid often stole from us, borrowed from loan sharks and even used her bank account as an intermediary for those ah long."
22221,"Also that's not even my fucking point, you are exactly the kind of people inferring to; chucking everything to racism/discrimination/stereotypes to make it easy."
22222,"A Dubai model relies on more and more expats and while the locals get to live very comfortably, they become completely irrelevant."
22223,Yeah only that 1 person.You trying to make it sound like all malays and indians are calling chinese racist for just something like that.
22224,People who actually have experienced daily racism like that usually don’t.
22225,I'm sure Malaysia is not racist too
22226,"If they are ""rich"" people who are rich enough to hire help , in this case they don't even have elderly or children in their home... Why can't they just pay properly to that maid."
22227,Had a couple of racist incidents overseas but nothing quite like what I've experienced in Singapore.
22228,"I think it's because in Singapore, people come with pre-conceived notions about Indians that are passed down generations/held up by racist institutions/accepted as normal in everyday life."
22229,Yeah send all the maids back now.
22230,Yeah some expat and hipster places have gluten free options iirc
22231,"It's like the new ""I'm not racist, but...""."
22232,"My personal vote is on b), and yeah best way to deal with it imo is head on confrontation ie: speak w the homeowners not the maid, and go the polite way if u rly want to stick to diplomacy...but yknow sometimes people just don’t want to cooperate."
22233,The maid should have gone through the normal termination process instead of abruptly leaving.
22234,"When it is particularly a he say she say situation - which always manifests in sexual harrassment cases, but not always in racism cases."
22235,"When it comes to racism - it could either be he say she say, or it could be something with clear evidence."
22236,Yeah the maid cafe craze has sort of declined in Japan as well.
22237,"Majority of a country would be the majority race, and the majority race probably isn't experiencing much, if any, racism."
22238,Yeah the racism is rampant in singapore and it’s amazing watching the sub defend it as justified.
22239,"But now suddenly a white person acts racist against Chinese and it's somehow because of ""France's freedom of expression"" as if racism doesn't exist in every country."
22240,I’m here on an employment pass.
22241,"As someone working overseas you can probably tolerate with the casual racism more than someone who is born in Singapore and have to face them since birth, in a place they call home."
22242,Yeah these racist boomers are ignorant and unwilling to be corrected.
22243,That kills the argument for the victims of racism.
22244,"You are not in their shoes, everyday having someone belittle you, give you dirty looks, make you feel like you don't belong, makes you feel like a sub human etc THAT is the life of someone who lives with racism."
22245,"Just cause people are not physically beating people up doesn't mean ""oh you can have it much worse in the west don't complain you don't actually have it bad here"" - guy who doesn't experience racism in day to day life telling people who actually do how to feel"
22246,The SG newspapers would never advocate rights for FDW because they are controlled by the government.
22247,FDW.
22248,"Yeah this is what I mean when I say everyone wants to accuse others of being racist to ""win"" the argument."
22249,"Yeah well Kim Jong Un is literally starving his own citizens while crying crocodile tears, while Jo Teo is working to help migrant workers in their dorms, and drafting policies for Singaporean workers."
22250,"Yeah why didn't other countries just get the virus to only infect young, fit migrant workers with a minuscule chance of dying and shove them all into a quarantine zone cut off from the rest of the population?"
22251,"Yeah your family experience with maids is what i saw with all my friends who has maids too, so this was a shock."
22252,"Yeah you’re right, on the other hand, I wouldn’t want to rent from a racist too… what’s it call?"
22253,"Whenever I hear my mom saying things like ""malays are very lazy"" I would always say she is being racist."
22254,"I think the people who use ""hei"" use chinese primarily and don't realize how racist it sounds in English."
22255,Is that racist?
22256,Is that racist?
22257,Which would deem to be racist?
22258,I don't want to say anything because I am not a racist.
22259,"It's just that because of government policies, most caucasians working here tend to have the 'expat package', and it's very easy (for me at least) to assume that case and be disoriented when it is otherwise."
22260,She's also competing against many other expats from developing nations around us.
22261,If you do all the lazing about and none of the work then you'll get fired pretty quickly - and if it's for a company with limited headcount here in Singapore the hiring manager may then get a negative selection bias after hiring a useless person leading to them prioritising expats.
22262,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-pacific-rim-psychology/article/racism-and-the-pinkerton-syndrome-in-singapore-effects-of-race-on-hiring-decisions/5924D22CCF6F71558B5DE9002CDBA12F?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app
22263,"Yeah, I have not heard one foreign worker advocating for welfare and safety."
22264,"Yeah, I have some experience with the expat bubble."
22265,"Yeah, I know Tamil is one of the 4 main languages as well - just seen a lot of casually racist comments and warnings on the web from time to time."
22266,But expats coming to Singapore are usually coming from countries with higher tax rates.
22267,"I assume the people here saying expat packages are gone are talking about Singapore specifically, not Hong Kong or the whole world in general."
22268,"Yeah, I saw some texts but the maid stuff is hearsay"
22269,"Only rationale I can think of is that these people are hoping the PAP enacts similar policies to keep all the Bangladeshi, Philippino and PRC immigrants out."
22270,"Yeah, Indian here as well, the ""racism"" is just subtle but still there."
22271,I'll call it racism when we're actively hunted down for being Indian.
22272,"Yeah, but  is xenophobia though."
22273,"Yeah, but front-line work has a sense of prestige, but working along low-pay immigrant folk may not have the same feel (unless we are dreaming of purely Singaporean construction workforce)."
22274,It's not racist for a landlord to want to protect themself from cleaning costs incurred by a tenant.
22275,"Flat-out banning Indians from renting on the other hand, is racism."
22276,"Yeah, but the point is that expat jobs and local jobs are so intertwined that you can't really address one without the other."
22277,"Yeah, but then you'd be the foreign expat taking housing from the locals then..."
22278,"Yeah, community spread outside of foreign workers have pretty much flattened, but the worker dorms are now undergoing exponential."
22279,So the average Singaporean won't get infected as long as the migrant workers in general stay quarantined away from other parts of society and lockdown measures are gradually relaxed instead of removed all at once.
22280,"It's not even racist, it's just plain lazy and stupid"
22281,My mom that I mentioned is of East Javanese decent and her and her side of the family are so stupidly racist against Boyanese that it's actually ridiculous.
22282,"It's not racist in the hatred sense, but more like ridicule and avoidance and talking shit about them."
22283,"I'm really replying to CaiusG here, who seems to know definitively that ""most minorities"" do not think it is an act of racism."
22284,Im an expat and singapore is just starting to feel like an expensive prison.
22285,A lot of my expat friends have already decided to return home.
22286,"Yeah, most 'expats' are usually mid or senior managers so this rental allowance tends to be enough to cover condo rent in Orchard / River Valley at least."
22287,"The allowance isn't based on where the expat 'wishes' to stay, rather on the home pay / PPP etc."
22288,"Yeah, most minorities just laugh or facepalm when we hear this BS about racism being confined to specific sections."
22289,"Yeah, my relative's maid is awful but they put up with it for some reason."
22290,"Somehow, the CMIO construct doesn't extend to non-Singaporeans in my mental model, so nationality is used by default."
22291,"But given how much they shit the bed (IMO with the massive migrant worker crisis finally bursting and other moves), I'm not too hot on them."
22292,"Yeah, only Citizens, PRs and long term pass holders of the designation country, are allowed to travel via the VTL at this moment."
22293,"Yeah, that line to me isn't *that* racist, more of just an old mentality."
22294,"So if an expat has a unique skill set, it makes sense I guess."
22295,"Yeah, that's unacceptable racism."
22296,"Yeah, the french equivalent of maid is 'female manager'."
22297,"The names are different, but they're all treated with a lot more class than the term ""maid"" is in Singapore."
22298,"Yeah, there have been quite a number of cases of maid abuse recently."
22299,"Yeah, there was a documentary I watched years back (UK based) that picked a bunch of random racist people, asked about all their racist beliefs (mostly ""send them all back""), then did the ancestry test."
22300,"Yeah, there's a lot about Singapore that would make expats, who are used to living in bigger countries, feel trapped."
22301,"So Mr. bespectacled Chinese man, if you don't like treating people from a hundred different countries as your equals, then take your racist ass back to China."
22302,"Yeah, those expats are so entitled!"
22303,But the way they phrase it sounds like any work permit holder.
22304,"Yeah, we are one of the poorer expats staying here."
22305,"Yeah, we need to find out what’s radicalizing these racists, if they are."
22306,Or if it’s latent racism.
22307,"Yeah, when he's the one harming the maid smh."
22308,I am genuinely interested to hear your take on systemic racism if you have any though.
22309,"Yeah, you’re spot on about the subtle racism - I’ve lived in Australia my whole life (until I moved here), so I have a fairly strong Australian accent, mannerisms, cultural quirks etc., but am ethnically Indian."
22310,Racism against any of the CMIO races is Singapore is one of the contributing factors to many citizens discriminating other races that don't fall in the CMIO group as well.
22311,People who are getting maids to look after elderly and/or their kids (parents working can't help etc/too old) definitely see love in maids as a cheaper option then daycare/nannies etc
22312,I’m not familiar with the situation but it seems to me that this person got a platform because they were racist and then is being cancelled because of said racism?
22313,"I try to advocate for locals where I can, not cause I'm trying to be xenophobic, but that I do hold a personal belief that there's an uneven playing field."
22314,Really hope the racism dies out with their generation.
22315,Actually I bypass the agent when I renew my helper work permit (easily done online through MOM website) and insurance (I know an agent who sell insurance for maids).
22316,"Just like the fact that ""taxpayers are paying for the negative externality caused by companies that hire foreign workers."""
22317,"Internally, it's difficult for people to see how desensitised we are to all this, and how it breeds the dehumanisation of foreign workers and essentially, race."
22318,"Before the FDW starts work, the upfront costs sunk in by the employer is easily 5k and above now."
22319,And the FDW can bail out on you any time.
22320,"Emotional abuse, overworking the maid, failure to provide a safe workplace, etc."
22321,The expats I worked with sure as hell didn't enjoy generous packages lol
22322,"Isn't that ironic given that it's a racist term that encompassing all Chinese, even Singaporean Chinese."
22323,Yeah... ironically I don't see them calling racist when they get preferable treatment for discounted price by a fellow mancik while buying nasi padang
22324,But VTL literally stands for Vaccinated Travel Lane.
22325,Yeahhhh i noticed for all my friends that they treated their maid like a family member (or else i'd cut off the friendship LOL).
22326,We still do see a-lot of blaming comments on front-line and migrant workers.
22327,"""Ya lor gov fault, not that I want to make these sort of racist comment."""
22328,"Yeap, so I think it's worth discussing why the government appears to be choosing to ignore the situation entirely, when they have been known to treat other instances of racism and/or xenophobia very seriously."
22329,"Is the term for it ""xenophobia""?"
22330,"I get it’s FT and things will be written from an expat POV, but the geez the optics from a local perspective are…not great."
22331,"I mean I generally sympathise with the points made, but it is a _little_ irksome to hear it coming only from expats."
22332,"Of course, it’s probably worse for expats who can’t go home to see their families and stuff, but framing this as a local vs expat thing is not gonna win you local fans."
22333,My maid had finished her loan after serving a little over 6 months with us.
22334,She came to us out of the blue one morning asking for a transfer to an agency in lucky plaza who had supposedly found an expat employer offering more money.
22335,She was also our second maid - we had to let the first one go because she was caught stealing money from us and putting my wife’s makeup and dresses on.
22336,Wife and me swore off having maids ever again.
22337,Yep I call them domestic helpers.
22338,So am I racist for not wanting to rent it to Indian man?
22339,Chucking everything to racism is a easy way out to solve something you don't like.
22340,"Shit like ""We don't rent to Indians they make the house smelly"" is racist, but what if it's because it happened to them?"
22341,"I'd rather be called racist knowing I have nothing against anyone, than to risk having to spend money cleaning up only to have it fucked again."
22342,Yep and once we test 300k foreign workers we’ll probably have the highest per capita testing rate in the world.
22343,Yep so the maid should be responsible for the services and miscellaneous fee currently taken care of by the employer.
22344,"The only volumes the maid is speaking is severe lack of professionalism, which is fine by me as long as she appropriately reimburses the employer."
22345,If the maids contract includes a probation period which allows her to drop and walk with no penalties then the agency should once again be investigated and punished harshly if found guilty of contract violation and pretty much scamming both the maid of her commission and service fee of the employer.
22346,"Yep yep the matter on foreign workers, ya that could vastly improve."
22347,"It’s a different ball game and some businesses definitely cut corners/costs for profit etcetc  The FDW situation who are living with their employers though, really is a topic to be discussed separately, I can see how easy it is to lump them together (all foreign workers) but if you look closely, you shouldn’t because it doesn’t help anyone to look at it like that."
22348,The VTL requires you to take a PCR test on arrival at Changi Airport and quarantine until the results are out.
22349,"Clearly they can do better, reality is they just couldn’t be bothered due to the economic gain versus the cheap life of a foreign worker (in their eyes)."
22350,"Yep, as an expat in Singapore, I can confirm."
22351,its not about which country but how much money you make as a foreign worker; which directly translates to the type of work pass you hold.
22352,This is in conjunction with the recent issues for migrant workers and foreign talent.
22353,"I would like to add one more point, above i was critical of those who cover up racism with the very convenient  “ casual “ word."
22354,The only guys I know on expat packages are on old contracts and their companies are mostly trying to 'localise' them anyway.
22355,"There's no overt racism, although you may get idiotic comments or teasing about your way of thinking / way of speaking."
22356,The blatant racism seen in rental properties in Singapore is a huge culture shock to westerners who never experienced that overt kind of racism before.
22357,Calling it racist dilutes the movement and damages it's credibility.
22358,"And apart from maid employers, everyone else sees them as a pest."
22359,"I keep having friends on ig who post stories about how pinoy/indonesian maids hang around parks or malls on weekend with captions like ""Is this Singapore?"""
22360,"She could’ve kept the racism to herself and rejected the potential tenant using other excuses, even if her actual reason was based on skin color."
22361,"There is a kind of internalized racism and fear to black people within many asians, including Singaporeans and ourselves, borne from lack of understanding and exposure."
22362,"You almost never see an argument from the ""*ackshually* no racism"" people with the outright racists who straight up say they want to exclude based on race."
22363,"Yes   VTL flight to KL, tent car KL JB, Play golf, drive to Tuas 2nd link, take photo, drive back to KL, fly back singapore."
22364,"Yes - I was making an open invitation for people from the majority to consider racism systemically, rather than accusing them of gaslighting, as they may well come from the perspective of calling out all racist acts."
22365,"You won't be allowed to board a VTL flight if your QR code brings up a screen that shows that it is ""partially verified"" or ""not verified""."
22366,My point is that why do xenophobic comments and rants on STOMP/Yahoo News not get condemned to a similar degree?
22367,"Yes I agree, an expat package is much more likely to entice someone here on a shorter term stay"
22368,"Yes I agree, currently singapore is in a tough position because economically we are reliant on foreign workers."
22369,"Sure, having foreign workers come in to fill these jobs do help to solve this issue, but they should have also taken into account the long term sustainability of this practice."
22370,Advocating an improvement for working condition for our foreign workers = naive and stirring shit.
22371,"On a personal level, coming from a multicultural home, I haven’t seen my father since 2019 and I’ve been separated from my girlfriend since June 2020 due to border closures."
22372,I booked my flight when VTL ticket sales were stopped.
22373,"And the opposite we see in Singapore- first whites here came as colonial rulers, then managers with expats packages."
22374,"Some people seem to be less guarded because of the mindset  'wah alot of care are all foreign workers, we won't kena one'"
22375,I merely take issue with the quick accusations on agents as being racist.
22376,White expat in his mid-20s.
22377,Eastern European expat in his early-30s.
22378,"Sense of entitlement here is too fucking high, not just in terms of domestic helpers  And the WiFi part is basic human rights."
22379,They had no need for a maid from the third world living in their house as my mother and father would share household tasks together and when the kids were old enough we would help out too.
22380,The difference in having a cleaner come in once a week or a babysitter a few evenings and a 24/7 foreign domestic helper is stark.
22381,The domestic helpers do not have a chance to integrate in to Singaporean society.
22382,It is deeply unfair and yet Singaporeans feel entitled to it and feel they should pay the bare minimum they can get away with to these foreign workers.
22383,Yes LKY was racist.
22384,>different varying degree of racism.
22385,"If anything, applying the definition of racism properly is sort of the point here."
22386,"Terms such as ""casual racism"" ""micro-aggressions"" ""covert racism"" already convey a different meaning from mere ""racist""."
22387,"The employer is in a sense sort of the guardian of the FDW in that they are responsible for the housing, healthcare, schedule, food, rest and general welfare of their FDW throughout their stay here."
22388,"FDW should be free to pursue romantic relationships, but employers should also be free to decide if they want to hire someone in a relationship."
22389,"If not, it's best if the FDW moves on to find a more accomodating employer."
22390,Yes another piece of sleight of hand by the government pretending these VTLs were careful bilateral negotiations much like the failed 'bubbles'.
22391,The VTLs are completely unilateral and only represent Singapore relaxing its rules.
22392,Yes because I'm not xenophobic.
22393,ooouttrageaeeeeaas   everything is racist!
22394,"Yes because minorities here are getting beaten up, with [nearly 700 racist attacks in a week](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-asian-americans-report-hundreds-of-racist-attacks-20200327-pglnpbrupnd3ppasu7uf2itanu-story.html) involving acid attacks and serious injuries."
22395,Yes because those comments are irrelevant to a discussion about nationalism... there is already a thread about racism.
22396,"For the record I'm Chindian, and I posted on the thread about racism."
22397,Racism is different from xenophobia
22398,Yes but at times they don’t even realise that what they say is racist.
22399,What i did most of the time is just point out that what they say is racist/stereotypical.
22400,racism) is socialised then proposed solutions are unlikely to work because the fundamental assumptions are wrong.
22401,"Yes exactly, and as I said earlier, both me and my friends certainly do not condone racism, but as a matter of fact, its painful and costly to fork out significant amount of money just to perform the deep cleaning."
22402,I abhore racism but also we shouldn't be super super weary and need to tread on egg shells.
22403,The racism in America is systemic and the history of the dynamic between races there is different.
22404,It's not fair to compare it with the racial dynamics in Singapore where most of the racism is casual.
22405,Its possible to care about BOTH the Black Lives Matter movement AND the casual racism present in Singapore.
22406,Yes expats pick.
22407,"And the expats that want to come to Asia have a limited pool of choices unless they want to live in a more backward place, which is the point I’m making."
22408,Then why do expats want to live in China?
22409,"And like the other redditor pointed out, HK expats leaving is because of the China influence as well as the riots."
22410,Yes if they are on the VTL flight.
22411,Yes if we are hiring expats for tech roles or other creative roles it would be understandable.
22412,"One even allow the maid to go out and gaigai on her own on any day, as long as the chores at home are done."
22413,Yes it bugs me as well when seeing maids are treated less-human.
22414,Idk why some people think that it is ok to treat maids as rough and rude.
22415,http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jamie-vardy-leicester-to-investigate-alleged-racist-language-used-in-casino-10447552.html  http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/leicester-racism-storm-striker-jamie-6247343
22416,"Yes it is illegal, maids are contracted only to carry out work within the domestic household."
22417,It is time for gov to intervene and enforce higher standards so that the living condition of foreign workers will be up to the standards of the average local.
22418,To outright reject someone as a tenant because of their race is letting your own racist prejudice influence your decision making.
22419,"Yes it must be ""boomers"" being racist isn't it?"
22420,"But I do believe that as the VTL begins they are trying to set up something so TT QR codes can be verified by the Korean system too though, and vice versa for SG accepting Korean vaccinations."
22421,Yes it’s the shitty work culture that cultivate our reliance on maids.
22422,[Singaporean explaining why we need maids to Anthony Bourdain ](https://youtu.be/qpsDWwMxM3E&t=15m45s)
22423,"If you want to stop this assembly then you have to stop all assemblies imo, there’s no indicators that maids or helpers are at a higher risk of getting infected."
22424,Yes many of them are in debt because they borrow from unlicensed moneylenders (often fellow maids acting as middlemen) which charge high interest rates and that leads to a cycle of borrowing.
22425,Yes not all can be classified racist.
22426,"Let's not think racism and bullying are two different things, in the school context."
22427,"The kind of racism in school, is precisely meant to bully someone into submission or into oblivion."
22428,Yes of course its systemic racism.
22429,I work with TWC2 an organization that aids in the legal rights of foreign workers and maids in the country.
22430,There are TONS of cases of maids being mistreated and either killing themselves or leaving because of mistreatment.
22431,I was trying to push against the idea that it is the industry itself which is inherently immoral and should be banned for the welfare of the maids.
22432,How many bigoted racists among you believe otherwise doesn't change the facts.
22433,And ofcourse you are racist.
22434,Yes practically speaking in other countries there are laws against explicitly being racist.
22435,Does it change the racism inside their hearts?
22436,But it creates a social norm that states “we do not accept this type of racism here” and we are willing to enforce it with the law.
22437,"The next step of the landlord is still acting racist and never accepting Indians let’s say, would be to gather evidence that these actions over time are an indication of racism."
22438,"So now we know it's not CECA that force us to open leg, it's us, the government that decided to open leg to all of them."
22439,Yes racism is not tolerated in our society.
22440,"The IO said they will review the cctv footage of the maid withdrawing the money to confirm that it is her, as well as conduct further investigations."
22441,We understand that the money will be hard to recover and it’ll be even harder to locate the maid.
22442,"And I don’t think we’ll be hiring another domestic helper anytime soon, or probably ever."
22443,Yes some stories are clearly racist.
22444,Is every single allegation racist though?
22445,"Like I said, dealing with racism is good."
22446,"Yes thank you, i have seen many posts here generalising FDWs as innocent and all enployers as evil."
22447,"If they had stayed with FDWs before, they would know that there are quite a number of them who are difficult to manage."
22448,My family had 3 FDWs in the past.
22449,"Yes that is correct, here's the guidelines for the UK: https://www.gov.uk/au-pairs-employment-law/au-pairs  Apart from an Au Pair which you do hear of very well off families having (although more as a young member of the family than a worker) I don't really think the career of a live-in maid exists in the UK."
22450,"Yes that is racist, which is what I said."
22451,Refusing to date someone JUST because they are from a particular race is indeed racism.
22452,The Hua Yuan Hui I found was an association for Chinese expats in Singapore.
22453,">it's unfair for ""victims"" to use preferences of individuals as a reason to label them as racism."
22454,"Yes there is racism against Indians, albeit subtle."
22455,Yes this is extremely racist.
22456,The power balance between maid/employer is screwed up making this rampant.
22457,People who were triggered probably don't want to admit that we ARE racist.
22458,"Like when we do it to other races it's ""just for laughs"" but when it's done to us, it's racist?"
22459,In this case racism literally cost me employment and income opportunities that my Chinese friends would have had no problem getting.
22460,Australia also plans to open up VTL to Singapore soon.
22461,Yes what I meant was proper transport for migrant workers and covered walkways in the estate are not conflicting matters in theory.
22462,It’s ridiculous that self-centred people think improving transport for migrant workers will somehow cause covered walkways to be sacrificed.
22463,Yes yes yes PA fucked up but I read again and I don't find any part of the incident racist.
22464,"I will feel hurt, but I won't think you're a racist."
22465,"Sadly, discrimination in Singapore is a thing, and people don’t realised that it’s the foreign workers that help build many things in Singapore."
22466,But we are not even paying FDWs local wages.
22467,"Perhaps grabfood is a bad comparison, although an FDW also has to be reasonably active and has a basic understanding of English."
22468,"Let's say an FDW earns the same amount, but their working hours are way longer, and they have more responsibilities (cooking, taking care of children)."
22469,I have realised the follies of my old ways of thinking about CECA!
22470,Then fight hard for immigration changes instead of scapegoating CECA and wasting energy on it!
22471,"Yes, I acknowledge that certain individuals in the minority group in SG can be racist."
22472,I am also pointing out that racist behaviour is often displayed by the majority.
22473,"Yes, I agree that everyone is a little bit racist and that’s ok."
22474,"Again, I'm not saying SAP schools are inherently evil or SAP students are racist."
22475,"Yes, I don't know how sustainable the VTL scheme is going to be over the long term."
22476,"Yes, I feel in my *personal* capacity, it's racist and if you permit me an explanation I'd like to explain why."
22477,"He could've done it for the Filipinos, Europeans or mainland Chinese immigrant populations but I feel he took a cowardly approach by targeting a demographic which given the demographic make-up of Singapore, makes them seem like easy pickings (coupled with poor representation, the Little India incident etc)  As someone who's been told to 'Balik Tongshan' or 'fuck off to China' in the past, this is admittedly mild and probably tongue in cheek, rather than anything malicious but I can understand where distaste would come from."
22478,No exemptions for work permit holders & students in Singapore.
22479,We definitely need to do more in regulating and and tweaking the FDW system.
22480,"And the commenters who don't realise that it's one thing to hate china, but being racist doesn't help."
22481,"By only saying “there’s AIDS somewhere in this universe”, like “there’s racism somewhere in this universe”, isn’t going to do or help with anything in relation to the real problem."
22482,"But compared to them, I was able to subdue my racist thoughts easily because I have had the opposite experience and I understand that not everyone will experience the same as I do."
22483,"Hence, for me, it is much easier to fix or restraint myself before attempting to fix the problem in others-be it a racist or a rotten apple."
22484,"I know some maids don’t have a bedroom and work unrealistic hours, have few rest days, etc."
22485,I feel that the other comments indicate either a degree of prejudice against expats or a lack of mental health awareness.
22486,"For many of these expats, friends really are family."
22487,"Ultimately I agree with you that it's not one or the other, but until better options are already funded and implemented, it's better not to ban child labour or maids."
22488,"Yes, Singapore has widespread racism, and unfortunately it comes from the top."
22489,Lee Kuan Yew was quite well known for his racist views.
22490,"Yes, Singapore permits travel to any VTL countries in the preceding 14 days."
22491,"However, I am always depressed seeing xenophobic complaints; because that's the exact same complaint in just about every other country I've lived in - and whenever the government took actions to please is populace, thing got worse (which ironically, heightens xenophobia and creates a spiraling cycle)."
22492,"On a FB group I had two Singaporeans tell me that it couldn't be done, only for an expat to tell me that he just did it."
22493,In the 70s the govt started issuing FDW (foreign direct worker i.e.
22494,"—  On a last note, I do think - from your unusual use of the phrase ""live in maids"", you don't sound Singaporean - foreigners only hear the horror stories."
22495,"Anw, good on you to offer your seat to our foreign workers!"
22496,"On the point of whether treatment of maids and foreign workers is racist or classist etc, I think they're all manifestations of this in-group/out-group bias."
22497,"I said that Malays and Islam are tightly linked, and you went ""BUT CHINESE AND INDIAN MUSLIMS HURRDURR"", followed by saying insulting a religion isn't being racist."
22498,"Add on the word ""expat"" and the countries listed, and it becomes a class issue, with Malaysian seen as lower class."
22499,Must be the evil migrant workers right?
22500,"Yes, because only Chinese families have maids."
22501,"Yes, because the 21st century has been characterised by a great welcoming of immigrants all over the world."
22502,Also we don't provide a path to citizenship for transient workers.
22503,They're transient workers here to make some money for a few years before returning home.
22504,"At the same time, continue to take away your maid’s passport in the name of ‘so she doesn’t run away with my jewelry’, make her sleep in your bomb shelter or on your kitchen floor, refuse to let her eat with you at the restaurant and deny her access to socialisation with her peers."
22505,"Yes, certainly the FWL can be a source of funding the govt should be dipping into for ALL the migrant workers, not just the workers living in dorms that have become isolation centres or clusters."
22506,"Also, FYI, the total population of non-domestic foreign workers is at least 200k (source: this MOM report states the number at June 2019 to be 284,300; https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers)."
22507,"Yes, coming from the majority race, I agree the rental market should have some regulation regarding race discrimination."
22508,"Yes, considering the hire of maids has been in the system for so long, there's been so many issues, we employ maids and other foreign workers extensively, the levies on them and their own contributions are great for the economy, there really should be a strong body of laws and institutions to protect their rights and ensure employers and workers comply with regulations and standards."
22509,"Yes, done, paid (the PCR tests) and approved in 3 minutes (and forwarded as an FYI to my HR just because)  [https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/VTL](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/VTL)"
22510,"Treat migrants better, treat locals as important as foreign talents, allow all races, sexual preference, genders to lead the nation and why not erase the race on our ICs!"
22511,"Before that, I think there was some anti-Ang Moh stuff I think (basically labelling them all as sexpats here to take our women)."
22512,"I think it's disingenuous to see this as racism, especially when these people on Facebook (predominantly of Chinese dissent) hate Chinese people just as much."
22513,Would you say a Singaporean-born Chinese hating China-born Chinese is racist?
22514,"I would say it's xenophobic, not racist."
22515,"So, unpopular opinion, this post is not racist, it's xenophobic and there's a difference."
22516,The reason for one day's notice is probably to give the VTL airlines enough time to remove VTL sales from their systems.
22517,"Yes, it is cheaper even with the maid's song's college tuition included (Philippines)"
22518,Perhaps a tiny temporary dormitory.
22519,"Yes, it is precedent to stereotyping and even racism!"
22520,"No one is born a racist, and I’m not even sure you can call kids this age racist anyway, they’ve picked up some bad ideas from someone at home but their minds are not set yet."
22521,"It is hard to get PR nowadays, I'm sure your uncle knows what to do to improve his chances of getting a PR approval."
22522,My bigger concern: The VTL being canceled while I'm in Germany and having to wait for re-entry approval.
22523,"In this case, a pregnant FDW is potentially quite vulnerable and I understand why this is put in place."
22524,"It's not fine if you choose the Chinese guy because you think Indians will make the house dirty, which is obviously a racist thought."
22525,"Ideally, we shouldn't entertain racist thoughts but like all ideals, it is very hard to achieve seeing as how little we are exposed to the other race."
22526,"So IMO, the least we can do is try to prevent explicit racism."
22527,"I.e., If you really, really, reaaallyyy wanna be racist, just don't make it obvious like putting out racial requirements on a rental posting."
22528,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting it's okay to be implicitly racist either."
22529,Just that clamping down on explicit racism is easier to achieve individually or as a society.
22530,"Yes, let's make snide remarks based on xenophobic stereotypes while showing zero fucking empathy for hundreds of millions of poor people desperately struggling to keep each other alive amidst one of the worst pandemics in modern history."
22531,"Yes, most importantly hearing both sides of the accused and the victim of racism."
22532,"Yes, my parents are low-key racists too, typical for their generation, but they also taught me that its important to be a good person, to not judge a book by its cover and also to not be an asshole to others."
22533,"There are many instances of racism in Singapore which I will not deny, but we have to state something for what it is, and not brainlessly label everything as racism."
22534,"Yes, my race has its share of racists."
22535,But I hope you won't call my race racist because of them.
22536,"Yes, not all Singaporeans are racist."
22537,But while there’re such heartwarming examples out there are also cases where Indians are discriminated against (immediately what comes to mind is the Ngee Ann Poly lecturer making racist comments to Mr Dave Parkash).
22538,There’re also others like Lim Tean who have successfully manipulated anti-CECA sentiment into anti-Indian sentiment.
22539,"A popular national song has this line ""*every creed and every race has its role and has its place*"", which I thought referred to equality, but seems racist upon further thinking."
22540,"Yes, racism has always been dominant in our SG Chinese culture; I was brought up by my elder family members including my parents to watch out for ""Malays/Indians""."
22541,"So my mother tongue is actually Teochew & Hokkien, not this ""Mandarin"" garbage."
22542,And all of this has just spurred a rise in feeling superior in being a Chinese in SG; so whatever racism sentiments the elder generation felt against minorities here; they have now been vindicated to get even bolder.
22543,That's why you see the rise in recent cases like the racist NP lecturer (from my school somemore) or the cunt kicking some poor SG Indian lady.
22544,So they feel glorified to be even more openly racist and hostile to minority races.
22545,"I lost count at how many racist incidents my Malay & Indian friends have faced here, despite them also being Singaporeans ffs."
22546,"Yes, racism is not acceptable."
22547,"Yes, racism will exist through the times."
22548,"Yes, she is lucky but if you pay peanuts, you shouldn't be surprised if you get terrible maids."
22549,The annual maid salary barely crosses 5K.
22550,It might be possible to bring them in on expat package.
22551,I didn't mean for this post to sound like I was identifying myself as an expat in Singapore.
22552,"Yes, sure it's a VTL flight."
22553,They basically told me to get lost on the phone since there are no other VTL flights available.
22554,They must be active to eliminate racism.
22555,"Yes, the actors who reject such scenes are the racist ones."
22556,"I think the finger isn't exactly pointed at the staffer per se, but it's that the entire situation highlights how normalised racism is."
22557,"Yes, the treatment of maids and foreign labour is generally absolutely horrendous."
22558,"Yes, their visa (work pass)  is tied to a specific employer, or at least to the job of being a domestic helper."
22559,You understand that the term “domestic helper” here refers to live-in help.
22560,The UA flight is non-VTL designated and is way cheaper than the SQ flight even though it literally flies the same route using the same way points.
22561,"I do not really care about traveling with vaccinated travelers, so why don't we just drop this VTL vs non-VTL BS and just allow all vaccinated passengers (or Singaporeans) to enter quarantine free?"
22562,So as far as I can work out they are separating work permit holders out and then sub-dividing that into dorm / non-dorm.
22563,"So lets take the Situation Report population at risk numbers, Dorms - 323,000 / Non-dorm 664,000 = total 987,000  That number nicely matches up with the June 2019 numbers here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers Work permit total = 981,000  The interesting thing though is that those numbers include FDW permits which would seem to be the definition of residents in the 'community'."
22564,"So as far as I can work out community cases include citizens, PRs and Pass Holders (EP/SPass/PEP/Student Dependents Social etc)  Work Permits group contains 323,000 in dorms, 255,800 FDWs and then another block of 408,200 Work permit holders that do not live in dorms."
22565,So the only thing that really ties this remaining group together is that according to work permit rules it's the employer that is responsible for providing housing for these workers (and in a way I guess that's technically the case with FDWs).
22566,"So a theory for this is that there's a fairly fluid definition of what is and what isn't a Dormitory and sure enough the MOM helps us out again here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing  So maybe the missing piece of the puzzle here is the large block of construction workers who are allowed to be housed in temporary quarters and these are not being counted as 'dormitories'   If this is the case (and the numbers seem to tally somewhat) then the only problem I can see is that the 255,000 FDWs being included in this group are reducing the prevalence in the non-dorm group."
22567,"She said the newer letters issued by MoM does not indicate the EP type anymore, and are only qualified for the expatriate account type."
22568,Unless you really plan to touch and go for your vacation just put the non-VTL countries first in your list and make sure you stay in a VTL country for 14 days after.
22569,But only if the foreign worker is white colour
22570,"OTOH for example a Batak Christian (ethnic group somewhat related to Malays) wouldn't know what to put as ""race"" (probably others, similar to Filipinos) since there are only those 4 options (CMIO)."
22571,"Yes, we don't have the racist past of white Americans, and the race relations are different, but within the scope of Singapore, we're the most privileged."
22572,"Yes, we need to understand the structural disadvantage that migrant workers have under our current system."
22573,We know several expats who have already left.
22574,Like find lots of oil or uranium under Bukit Timah or something - then we can be like Finland and be xenophobic in policy (very hard to migrate to Finland from outside the EU) while being very nice to natural born citizens.
22575,I don't see why such a comment would be racist.
22576,"I suppose I am also guilty of only living in the capital and in the “fancy areas” that expats love to frequent, so I conveniently forgot about economic migrants."
22577,"""This will give us the full picture of the infection prevalence among our migrant workers,"" they said."
22578,"A tinder profile that says ""white men only, no Chinese please"" is absolutely racist."
22579,A zoomaid.
22580,CECA may not give unfettered access to foreign labour but our own employers are fast to grab any cheap labour if policy allows.
22581,It all started with foreign talent when DBS first appointed a foreign CEO (John Olds).
22582,"I admit that there’s racism involved in her post, there’s no denying that, but the amount of toxicity from so many Singaporeans is unnecessary"
22583,"I have conversations with my parents about stuff like feminism, racism, abortion and US politics."
22584,I chose to travel on a non-VTL flight from Canada for the same reasons.
22585,"If she's treating her maid like this, what of her own family and friends?"
22586,I'm the least racist landlord out there
22587,It has always ways shocked me how many foreign workers are EMPLOYED in that place.
22588,Its not terribly xenophobic but I do feel its still a problem.
22589,"There are a lot of new measures as well, such as the TAFEP Watchlist that blacklists companies for 6 months from renewing or acquiring new EPs and waaay stricter considerations for citizenship  Despite this shift in our politics the xenophobic sentiment has seemed to have gotten a lot worse."
22590,It's racist and close-minded.
22591,Locally some people feel maids are a bad term.
22592,"But to me, maid is just maid lor."
22593,"No harrassment, just casually/ unintentionally racist comments from my parents."
22594,Racism js racism.
22595,On VTL flights.
22596,"To speak up against racism, be it casual or systematic."
22597,Everyone is capable of being a racist.
22598,"In fact, it is pretty much the definition of racism."
22599,"Recent reports show that they are continuing to only test those with symptoms + they test 2,900 per day + they're focusing on foreign workers."
22600,Piecing these together makes me think the stats are skewed towards foreign workers.
22601,One point I would to ask is did anyone (really) ask a foreign worker and how he feels about sitting at the back of a truck?
22602,"The whole ""Malays are lazy"" racist myth came from the British."
22603,These are all racist examples.
22604,"They're less angry when someone holds a position they expect, compared to an unexpected position which violates their racist expectations."
22605,"In general, they are upset of the government and not the immigrants because we know that it really isn't your fault."
22606,"Unfortunately, the migrant workers are paying the price of this xenophobia."
22607,Edit: the 0.2% mortality statistic is based on the current infection rates and excludes the time period at the beginning of the pandemic when migrant worker dorms were the main source of infection numbers in Singapore.
22608,"Yesterday, I went to the Singapore zoo and it seemed the animals were taken care of better than these migrant workers."
22609,Not sure if they approach me because I'm an expat who's looking like a tourist.
22610,Yet again in the Singapore sub the masses justify racism.
22611,Yet another maid abuse case.
22612,Yet another maid abusing her employer.
22613,When are maids going to stop exploiting poor old owners of four-storey houses?
22614,I'm glad we got to hear the full one side of the story (with the maid's side of the story completely untold).
22615,NS honestly does jack shit in stopping racism.
22616,You're still with a majority Chinese group no matter where you end up and just because you're forced to spend time with other races doesn't mean you have to fix your racist behaviour.
22617,Yet they complain about being victims of racism when people call it the Wuhan Virus.
22618,"It still hurts every single time, but I know racists are mainly a product of their environment."
22619,"That’s what makes it more deadly, bc you can’t point at personal experiences of many people to justify the racism the way you can just point at a policy and go “RACIST” in Malaysia."
22620,Tbh you guys are the racist one because you think that the points he brought up are problematic.
22621,You all know this situation is the same everywhere else for expats right?
22622,"A lot of my expat colleagues/friends end up hanging out with people from their own countries, but whilst making friends with locals might not be a walk in the park, there are plenty of meet up groups/Internations events for you to go to and meet like minded people."
22623,Minister of State & Manpower stated  > Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.
22624,"[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)  Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?"
22625,"handling of the foreign workers situation  Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above."
22626,[Source](https://progressgp.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/serangoon-gardens-dormitory-saga/)
22627,Some singaporean landlords are racist fucks and will not rent out the home to you.
22628,You are a disgusting racist pile of shit.
22629,You are a troll who is neither a citizen not someone living in SG going around making false baseless claims that CECA has nothing to do with hiring.
22630,"You are always welcome , just ignore those xenophobic."
22631,"Sure, enacting laws may not be easy, but that is not a good reason for us to do nothing, or to hypocritically condemn certain forms of racism and ignore other forms, while racial minorities continue to feel marginalised by only the basis of their races."
22632,You are aware maids chose to come here and earn SGD right?
22633,"You are aware that most maids, even on their off days, inform their employers if they're leaving the house?"
22634,"But even on normal off-days maids will usually say they're going out, so the employer is at least aware what's happening."
22635,"It is a study of how the law, society, political and systemic issues led to racism and the subjugating of minorities."
22636,"You are calling a country with racism written into constitution ""not that bad""?"
22637,"If the company can find qualified people that are locally based, of course they'd prefer this but generally not the case anymore if they have to resort to an expat package."
22638,"A lot of the mid level foreign employees are not on expat packages, at least that's true for westerners."
22639,As per the ICA Safe Travel website:  https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/faq#VTLReq  6.
22640,Are travellers required to obtain a booster dose to be eligible for the VTL?
22641,"Currently, VTL travellers are not required to obtain a booster dose."
22642,"You are criticising the behaviours of some Singaporeans with domestic helpers, but here you are in the same post referring to these employers as ""maid owners""?"
22643,"Chinese people have to take responsibility for their racism, and that is way more important to society than the ""radical fringes""."
22644,"So are you saying if we don't take responsibility for the ""radical fringes"" we should not take responsibility for racism?"
22645,Many employers need to take leave when their maid is on home leave or quarantine.
22646,"Might be easier now with WFH arrangements, but someone has to take care of the kids or elderly when the maid can’t work."
22647,"Using your software engineering problem,  you think the only option for Singapore and your company to succeed is to employ more foreign talent into Singapore."
22648,Both making sure your workers don't work in an unsafe situation and having certain safety standards put in place will make the domestic helper's life safer and better.
22649,You are just being racist now...
22650,"In fact the first paragraph says this:  The 47 companies collectively hire about 2,000 employment pass holders and more than 2,800 local professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs)."
22651,So still more local than foreign workers right?
22652,You are refusing to focus on racism in your own country and putting spotlight on racism in another country instead to deflect.
22653,You can't accuse everyone and everything of racism when it's just a manifestation of incompetency.
22654,>is there any reason why we should keep expats who arent willing to be here
22655,All chinese for racist Singaporeans.
22656,You are mistaking racism for xenophobia.
22657,"You are mixing up ""racism"" and ""racism against minority""."
22658,"For example if a racist Chinese aunty goes to India, is she now a racism victim?"
22659,"Of cause not, she is now a racist minority."
22660,"Now, if we were to take the very racist comment of ""that's why everybody hates Chinese nationals, so fucking inconsiderate"" mentioned earlier, how in the world can the intention behind posting such a statement be anything else other than the poster being a xenophobic asshole taking advantage of the current crisis to unleash his very unpolitically correct point of view on a (relatively) safe platform where he doesn't need to take responsibility for his comments?"
22661,"Perhaps this is news to you but in this FDW situation there are 2 major stakeholders, the FDWs and the employers."
22662,Nothing is going to change if you only take one side of this coin because the other side is not going to agree and here is the sad reality that you don't understand - the FDWs has no leverage at all.
22663,"You are also comparing this to minimum wage workers not getting paid enough and screaming ""fairness for our FDW!"""
22664,This are the little guys who are\*(edit) already getting screwed on top trying not to get screwed below by people like you who think that they are abusive bastards and purposefully not want to pay their FDWs more money.
22665,"You are not wrong in stating that racism is experienced across all races, but it is also true that the minorities in SG experience it to a greater degree."
22666,You are nt a racist
22667,"You need to have a job and on employment pass to do so, provided that you earn at least 5k and she's your spouse."
22668,You are one of the brave souls who walk the other way and actively fight racism—even if it’s in your own passive aggressive way.
22669,You are racist.
22670,In any event I think it's pretty obvious that this thread is talking about xenophobia in relation to natives v foreigners.
22671,No one is talking about how Chinese Singaporeans are xenophobic towards Malay Singaporeans.
22672,"All I am sauing is, SAP schools should be inclusive and allow Malays and Indians to join and learn their own mother tongue."
22673,"All schools should teach CMIO values to their students, not just SAP schools."
22674,"From what I know, work permit holders are often issued with a 7 days special pass after cancellation."
22675,"You are right, and I also do think it's a good economic decision to think twice about deporting a highly paid expat."
22676,Another thing is that some look too young to be an expat or are paying huge enough taxes to be justified not to get deported.
22677,I realised I got into the state of a long post about expats after reading through the comments.
22678,Division I (72% more females) and Division III (22% more females)   A major unknown also comes from the open immigration policy Singapore choose.
22679,"I had conflated MOM's definition of a rest day as being at least 8 hours break from work (from their [publication](https://www.mom.gov.sg/~/media/mom/documents/publications/fdw-weekly-rest-day/fdw-weekly-rest-day-english.pdf)) with the standard [Philippines FDW contract](http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/SECD.pdf), which states that the FDW ""shall be provided with continuous rest of at least 8 hours per day."""
22680,So maybe there is no such protection for maids from other countries.
22681,"An employer could technically let their maid sleep 8 hours on Saturday night, then say on Sunday that rest day is over!"
22682,"You are saying that if racism exists in Singapore, then Singaporeans should not talk about the situation in the US until racism is eradicated in Singapore?"
22683,"Unfortunately racism exists, in most countries, does that mean people from all other countries should not support the BLM movement?"
22684,"I acknowledge that racism exists in Singapore, but why can't someone talk about BLM without being dragged down for not speaking up about another issue?"
22685,"You do know that people read the news, they can have empathy for those who are suffering and can start to show support even if they were previously uninformed about racism right?"
22686,When have you done anything for the foreign workers in the dorms?
22687,If you go around saying that all Asians have slanty eyes ew then ofc that’s racist?
22688,"Putting on your dating profile: ‘No Asians pls they are ugly’, much like on rent ads: ‘No Indians’ is racist?"
22689,Yes you are racist if you think that Pakistani men are highly likely to be chauvinistic.
22690,"Anyway, I say this as a Chinese Singaporean who was a bit racist towards Chinese men."
22691,"Yes, my belief that all Chinese men were like my father was racist, and I admit that, and now I’m trying to be better."
22692,I’m not going to hide my racism as just ‘physical preference’.
22693,Every country has their own bunch of citizens having the same sentiments about foreigners/immigrants stealing their jobs.
22694,"I wish something could be done to combat racism but I think it'll only come with time and a higher TFR from other races, and if the powers that be don't actively enforce a racial majority."
22695,Sadly that also means the oportunity for discourse is lost and drops to just xenophobic comments
22696,"Oh, there's xenophobia in this story, alright."
22697,I work in an industry where expat packages are pretty common.
22698,Hiring executives on an expat package is a pretty dumb move for any company.
22699,You call 5% of the foreign worker population being allowed to go out of their prisons on weekdays a huge victory?
22700,Its people let their xenophobia of China neuter their economy.
22701,"You can [refer to this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4d0p1l/moving_to_singapore_as_an_expat_your_thoughts_on/) the OP there has a wife but the situation is still generally the same, as it's 2 people trying to get into Singapore as an expat."
22702,You can also acknowledge race and talk about someone’s race without being racist.
22703,There seems to be a concerted effort to make any ignorance about race to be racism.
22704,Not knowing traditional foods or social practices for a race is ignorance but not necessarily racist.
22705,"You can also apply for entry approval before your trip and serve SHN, but I have a feeling they're more fragile than VTLs are (like in May to August of this year)"
22706,"I know racism still exists in Singapore, even amongst the main races, but at least it's condemned between the major races, if for no other reason that we can't geographically quarantine ourselves by race and false stereotypes are hard to maintain when you likely know of at least a few people who don't fit those."
22707,You can be a accountable Singaporean and racist/xeno at the same time.
22708,"ultra nationalist who love their country  While accountability is important in this covid situation, the point being raised here is the subtle racism/xenophobia has the potential of disturpting social harmony in the future."
22709,You can be both pragmatic AND racist.
22710,"Chinese marries Vietnamese wife, vietnamese required is racist."
22711,Can the migrant workers choose not to ride a lorry?
22712,And we will not accept the maid's reason of 'buying too much' as a legit reason to return it.
22713,"So I don't feel that the maid was being discriminated against, rather it's the author who received extra privilege."
22714,You should be jailed and not allowed to hire another maid.
22715,You really want a racist asking you why is it racist?
22716,You need an spass or work pass or employment pass for that.
22717,You can make an economic decision and yet be racist in such decision making at the same time.
22718,You can read the singapore expat forums.
22719,The government is probably not going to reveal anything other the observations made in singapore expat forums.
22720,"You can see the flight schedule here: https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/germany-singapore-vaccinated-travel-lanes/ as you can see only the Germany to Singapore leg has VTL flights, other direction don’t have."
22721,"You can stand here and scream at people to treat maids better, or you can change the standards so that we can actually prosecute these people."
22722,"As demonstrated with the mandatory rest days in 2013 and formal definition of job scopes for maids in 2017, clear regulations lead to better outcomes for maids and easier prosecution for people who abuse them."
22723,I can only tell you that I know quite a few people who weren’t happy when they saw money spent to move the migrant workers to the cruise ships for quarantine earlier this year.
22724,I went back via VTL for CNY and it's even accepted as a pre-departure test for the KLIA->Changi VTL flight.
22725,"Based on who they are, people will disagree about which of these incidents are racist."
22726,"But it's not about an individual being explicitly racist, it's about the culture being implicitly racist."
22727,"In this incident, the man clearly yells racist slurs and is violent towards an innocent woman (wearing a mask while exercising is explicitly legal according to the rules)."
22728,People are denying racism when it's shouting at them in the face and change the subject.
22729,"It shows a lack of empathy, a lack of humanity, which if you reread my post, you'll see was my main point: not racism."
22730,"This is how people react when people point out racism, as you see in this comment section."
22731,"Can you imagine how it might feel for an Indian Singaporean to see a story about an innocent being assaulted in what is clearly a hate crime, and then see all the comments from Singaporeans denying the issue is race or xenophobia and changing the subject?"
22732,But at the end of the day it should be what you can afford - IIRC they receive a whole range of donations from corporate-size to even small donations from other migrant workers who've benefited from their work.
22733,"You can't ""Become racist"" just by moving somewhere."
22734,You can't be racist about food?
22735,](https://ny.eater.com/2016/3/23/11290082/stop-writing-racist-restaurant-reviews)
22736,You can't because it isn't racist.
22737,"What you are experiencing is stereotyping, not to be mixed or confused with racism."
22738,Feel free to make shocked pikachu face when something happens either employer to maid or maid to employer.
22739,"You can't control what people think, for all you know, people who walked pass you are harbouring racist thoughts, how would you know?"
22740,You should try to get all your mother's brothers and sisters to pay equal shares towards your grandma's maid.
22741,"It will probably work best if all your grandma's children set up a recurring payment to a new bank account in your grandma's name (you help them set this up if necessary), which is used to pay for the maid and possibly her medical expenses."
22742,You can't eradicate racism.
22743,"The only solution to eradicating racism, would be something akin to Adolf Hitler 's *Endlösung*, which I'm certain no one wants to see it come to pass any time now, or in the future."
22744,"Simply put, you'd need a racist to end racism, since that person believes no other race is superior than his own, and hence the former should cease to exist altogether."
22745,"*Learning to accept each other as equal human beings despite our differences*, I think, is all that's needed to tackle racism."
22746,You can't get more self-righteous than racism.
22747,Don't try to get sympathy for racism as well
22748,You can't legally work or freelance in Singapore unless you have an employer-sponsored employment pass.
22749,"You cannot have a ""regardless of race, language or religion"" as stated in the pledge, if new immigrants only insist on speaking their mother tongue, and not learn English."
22750,You all keep harping on racial harmony but ironically you are destroying one of the main thread holding the harmony together by saying asking new immigrants to learn English is racist and xenophobic.
22751,"With this suggestion and our taxes, we can ensure that foreign workers dorm and their tenants be treated as well as our NSFs"
22752,You can’t compare CECA to other FTAs because the latter do not include any ridiculous ‘Movement of People’ clause unlike CECA.
22753,Not everyone treats their maids like slaves.
22754,You can’t return to SG by VTL if you were in a non-VTL country with the 14 days prior.
22755,What I am really interested is (and you'll find that reflected in the parent comment) are there indeed instances of systemic or institutionalised racism in Singapore?
22756,"If the govt does indeed have such schemes to help underprivileged minorities, why are we constantly hearing anecdotes about how the govt is racist and continue to oppress minorities ala BLM?"
22757,"Again, I would like to know about examples of systemic racism."
22758,There are plenty of immigrants from all around the world in Norway..
22759,You could always travel freely between VTL countries.
22760,Switzerland and Germany are both VTL countries with direct flights to Singapore.
22761,And someone is probsbly gonna come in and say your suggestion is xenophobic or anti free market.
22762,"During circuit breaker, it was migrant workers."
22763,Also if you are advocating for FDWs to be paid more without housing that is honestly a lose-lose monetary scenario that you are advocating for.
22764,The employer would have pay more and the FDW might have less take home pay...
22765,"Allegedly, the maid came back to Singapore to look for a job with another family."
22766,All foreigners except migrant workers and domestic helpers are able to switch jobs quite effortlessly.
22767,You do know that Mandarin itself is not our mother tongue right?
22768,You do know that most of our foreign workers are lower income right.
22769,You do know that non-Malaysian work permit holders are not allowed to stay in HDB flats right?
22770,You do not own your domestic worker.
22771,You do realise how easy it is to find articles saying that minorities cannot be racist?
22772,"https://www.aclrc.com/myth-of-reverse-racism  >Racial prejudice can indeed be directed at white people (e.g., “White people can’t dance”) but is not considered racism because of the systemic relationship to power."
22773,You do realize racism is alive and well in SG right?
22774,"And stop with the ""denying racism"" shit man."
22775,"It could be racism against Indians, but how is it non-Chinese discrimination when Caucasians and Japanese/Koreans are the stated preference."
22776,"You don't have to abolish them, just include Malays and Indians who wish to attend a SAP school by letting them learn their mother tongue too?"
22777,You don't know what is racism?
22778,"It is natural for someone to be shocked after hearing a racist comment directed toward them, so its also up to the supervisor to know if the nurse was affected by his comment."
22779,The last statement was because you are suggesting to refuse the person's request because the person was racist.
22780,"Yes racism is wrong, but the needs and requests of the patient come first."
22781,You can't just say no to someone because the person is racist in the field of medicine.
22782,You don't need to be a full-on flaming nazi to be racist.
22783,"If someone wants to be mean and brings up another's skin color as a reason, no matter how petty the reasoning is, it's still racist."
22784,"The more society treats racism as some kind of incurable, life-destroying disease the more people are going to dig in and double down on their racist beliefs, as unintuitive as that sounds."
22785,"I know it's easy to get defensive or take it extremely personal when called out on even casual racism, but it's a stain on your shirt, just wipe it off."
22786,"You don't need to weed out the racists, they'll always expose themselves."
22787,"The maid was not charged for giving false evidence in court, because she was not giving a court statement."
22788,"Teacher was racist as fuck, said racist shit towards me on multiple occasions."
22789,"I could be racist to you and it's definitely fucking wrong but you will walk outside in public amongst other chinese, sit down in the public transport in most instances amongst chinese, go to work with majority chinese."
22790,"How have you suffered realisticalyl speaking from racist comments towards you, living in SG?"
22791,> Are actually you trying to dismiss the racist episode that I’ve experienced as invalid ?
22792,You don’t even have to look so far to see racism.
22793,Have you ever seen an expat working at Macs?
22794,Do you think the Netflix HQ here is only employing expats?
22795,Now it’s important to note that there’s a difference between expats and migrant workers.
22796,And that’s the whole basis of how the state of migrant workers got to this point (re: the main point of OP’s post).
22797,_That_ is xenophobia and racism towards foreigners.
22798,"You don’t need to fly back direct, from the east coast you could easily travel via a Europe VTL flight"
22799,"There are tons of ways to work abroad and while Singapore is a fairly easy destination as an expat, it’s by far not the easiest."
22800,“It is important for expat taxpayers to remember that you cannot claim both of these benefits for the same income.
22801,An expat tax professional can help you determine the best way to use these tax benefits to your advantage”   https://www.taxsamaritan.com/tax-preparation-services/expatriate-tax-services/foreign-earned-income-exclusion/
22802,How is asking a legitimate question being racist.
22803,"Also, you did not address my point as to whether all these benefits are worth devoting 2.5 years of your time when EPs can be brought in on expat packages, negating the higher costs they face."
22804,I don't get how that is lower than expats who don't get CPF contribution.
22805,"I also agree that there are racist people in Europe, but our laws and government is trying to suppress racism (I can only speak for Norway, and not Europe as a whole as I am unsure of the government in other European countries..) It seems like racism is more accepted by the Singaporean government (might not be the case, but it seems like it..)"
22806,"Kaopei over 1 maid, smlj who do you think you all are."
22807,The pay determines if you are going to get an employment pass or S pass.
22808,"IMO, the main problem are the racists and xenophobes who happily jump in and muddy the water with their own agenda."
22809,"You guys should look at the comments on mothership actually JUSTIFYING the racial confrontation just because there are ""too many of them""  and some of them had ""bad experiences"" with them but yeah doesn't give you the right to be racist just because of that."
22810,Yet everyone has of course jumped to conclusions  (because they're definitely not racist /s).
22811,Calling for a temporary halt to borders has unfortunately been hijacked by racists as a rallying cry but it still doesn't change the fact that we need to tighten borders.
22812,What's the point of bringing in foreign workers if we have to lock down the economy?
22813,"Also, these poor foreign workers aren't the ones circumventing bans by traveling to a 3rd country, then coming here."
22814,"There have been numerous cases since of premeditated murder by maids, including this one, who were only sentenced to life."
22815,"Fact remains, that Filipino maid was the last time, nearly 30 years ago."
22816,"You have a dictionary shoved so high up your ass that you're regurgitating **only** the direct meaning of the word 'racism' from what used to be your brain, instead of the specific context that is used right here in this very unique corner of the world as already explained to you: that to us Singaporeans IN Singapore, hate towards race and hate towards religion are considered almost one and the same due to the social-political landscape."
22817,"Not to mention from the tone of voice you've adapted throughout this conversation, you actually think hate speech towards religion holds a lot less weight than the same towards race *(""I will never support racism, never said I have, but offering critique on religion is quite acceptable"")*... that without even knowing the exact context, you've automatically degraded any hate towards religion to become mere ""critique"" until further notice."
22818,"It all depends on how you define ""racism"" at the end of the day."
22819,"You have a poor grasp of what makes expats move and pick countries, thinking they are just mercenaries that can all be replaced and will just come for the most money."
22820,You have a very peculiar view of the average foreign worker.
22821,https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers  You are really okay with Construction being dominated by foreign workers?
22822,What about domestic workers?
22823,Then your argument had to turn to: “but other commenters said they would have fired their maids regardless if the bf met the kid or not” — except that’s not the argument you posed in the first place.
22824,"You can’t keep changing your arguments to fit your agenda, which was to get people outraged over the treatment of this one maid."
22825,"Honestly, some people might feel it’s too “much” to fire a maid for this particular case, while others feel it’s perfectly ok, and you just have to accept that viewpoint."
22826,"Just as much as you feel you have read a lot of maid suicide cases in the news, there are also many cases of abuse involving maids and young children, when their employer is not present."
22827,"There are several cases of maids sleeping around with their bfs, doing inappropriate stuff in front of the kid, and in more fucked up cases, even with them."
22828,"If the maid gets sent back in this case, it’s unfortunate for her (especially when she had done nothing wrong) but parents always have the right to want to protect their children."
22829,"It’s not like they physically abused the maid and drove her to suicide — the maid can always come back and find another employer that would perhaps be more open-minded about these kind of things (or better yet, have no kids)."
22830,"If you want to make an argument about maids being mistreated in sg, go ahead."
22831,We know maid abuse can be prevalent here.
22832,"You have an idealistic approach but from observation, it seems like immigrants are chosen based on ethnicity more than anything else."
22833,And I also agree that's sad when the people you least expect to be racist... Exhibit racist behaviour  And when I said let go..
22834,That you think that telling people to do this is somehow racist is really telling.
22835,I don't think it is racist to observe that there are many powerful people and institutions in our society that like Singaporeans to be endlessly pliant and deferential.
22836,"To be blunt, acting purposefully is not only for white people and wanting it for ourselves is not racist.."
22837,You have no idea how many times i got called 'xenophobic' for pointing out their double standards and sense of entitlement.
22838,"You implying that new immigrant's values or opinions matters less, or even the idea that there are two classes of Singaporeans is toxic and outdated."
22839,What you've done is amplify my every experience learning about their experience with racism with an added layer of passive aggressiveness.
22840,You just agreed in a previous that maid abuse is not 100% of all helperd hired in Singapore.
22841,Every little thing also play the racism card.
22842,"You just made a racist stereotype... that's like, the exact same thing you're complaining about the nurse doing."
22843,This isn't about whether the issue is racist or insensitive.
22844,"There is another level of reason for why this racism/insensitive dichotomy is happening, but I think I rather not say"
22845,We're talking about migrant workers here?
22846,"You just said you weren’t racist, now you admit you are and you claim everyone is racist."
22847,It’s amazing how unbelievably deluded you are to have to help yourself feel better about having an asshole mindset and giving yourself the excuse not to try and change yourself simply by telling yourself “everyone is racist so it’s okay for me”.
22848,My parents who are racist have simply made me learn that it is not okay to have a mindset like that.
22849,You justifying racism already invalidates all of your own views so that makes two of us.
22850,You obviously dont need to use your watered down mother tongue to earn a living.
22851,"You know I always felt this way as well and then when it happened to me, I felt like, aiyah not worth the trouble and attention to confront some racist person."
22852,Do you mean (1) employers should not have sex with their FDWs or (2) FDWs should not be having sex when they are FDWs.
22853,Employers are in positions of power over FDWs.
22854,FDWs are adults who can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
22855,"Of course, punishing employers for FDWs getting pregnant doesn't help with this."
22856,"Not saying all of them area racist, they're definitely not but I would be delusional to say a huge number of them isn't."
22857,"Once the wuhan virus came out, I see a lot of my friends especially those going overseas saying things like how people are racist to them and they didn't do anything to deserve it."
22858,Meanwhile some of these people have personally said extremely racist things themselves.
22859,"Like they'll say things like ""ah pu neh neh"" and shit like that and they (the non-indians) will group up and say no it's not racist."
22860,You know our complaints about employers piling too much work on us and making us do like multiple people's jobs pales in comparison to this poor maid and many others like her.
22861,"Of course if that family of six includes children, you know the childcare is gonna fall on the maid."
22862,"All in all, being a domestic helper is the worst."
22863,They were handcuffed while waiting for testing because they were illegal immigrants.
22864,"You know that when someone says, *""not trying to be racist ah""*, some racist shit is going to come out of his mouth."
22865,"Paul is just one of the many companies exploiting on that unfamiliarity expatriates have with PR Application and misleading people into thinking “oh, I have to do all of these additional things so that my chances are bettered.” In reality…  1."
22866,"Also, the reality behind PR approvals:  a."
22867,"shelter, is ""just business"" and therefore racism is okay now"
22868,"People spend the extra $800-1000 to get domestic helpers, but refuse to spend any more to FEED them."
22869,You know what's the different between migrant worker and Singaporean?
22870,Or are you guys migrant worker?
22871,"What i'm not willing to give the light of day is the amount of blatant untruths about the systematic racism that the entire SG govt is specifically targeting all black people for student visas, employment etc that are so rampant in the other thread."
22872,"Pay disparity, sexual racism, skill overvaluation, all of these are because of our persistent colonial hangover and our desperate need to be part of the anglosphere."
22873,"And you know what, we suck it up, laugh with them, imply our acceptance of reductivist and racist garbage, and then we try to elevate ourselves, and play ""one of the good ones""."
22874,"I've been called racist before, but I'm not."
22875,You know who wants to have a say in how bullying ot racism is defined?
22876,"And if you think bullying and racism are two different things, you need to read up more on how they both have the same effect on someone who is a victim of either"
22877,You know you're the first expat I've ever heard saying that not owning a car is a torture in Singapore.
22878,And I acknowledge those landlords are highly likely to be practicing racism.
22879,"I am probably going to be downvoted again but I say it again, I don't condone racism but...  if people want to practice their racist ideologies, they should not do so in the public sphere but they are free to do so in their private sphere because of liberty."
22880,"There are racist landlords who want to practice racism - that is their right to (**I am not saying it's acceptable**), but the moment those racists bring their racism into the public sphere, the laws will go after them - and I think that's fair."
22881,As such I lean towards giving landlords the freedom to do what they want (even if they want to practice racism) as long as they leave it in their private domains - no racist ads.
22882,"You know, I've been living in the US the past 2 years, and I have NEVER been the victim of any racist incident, comment, or interaction, not even during this whole COVID-19 thing."
22883,It's my impression that Americans GENERALLY are more sensitive about race and wouldn't hesitate to call out racist behavior.
22884,"Not saying this is unanimous everywhere, but at least in the Northeast, racism is less common."
22885,Such a quote implies that she genuinely doesn't think she needs to shoulder any blame in the COVID outbreak amongst migrant workers.
22886,"I think the government has done an excellent job in containing COVID, but the migrant worker outbreak was an oversight."
22887,"You know, since the NGOs keep harping that migrant workers are one of us, they should ask the MWs to also 'open their windows' and sing Home together."
22888,"By default, all of us were placed in the B category for mother tongue and A for English."
22889,You literally have a post history full of racism.
22890,"Also, condemning racism is being woke, not ‘being woke’ cause it’s legit"
22891,"You live being willfully ignorant, so that you can continue with your CECA canard."
22892,The fact remains that CECA list only is a whitelist of areas where they are even allowed to apply.
22893,You lot are all racist pricks.
22894,Breaking the cycle is how progress can be made when it comes to the treatment of FDWs.
22895,"There also is an increasing amount of anti-immigrant/Muslim sentiment in parts of EU, which makes it really hypocritical of you to only complain about racism here."
22896,The unfortunate fact is that racism exists in all parts of the world.
22897,"They do have a good point about ivory tower syndrome, if politicians just push the policies and label them as xenophobic without listening."
22898,"Not all foreigners are on expat packages you know, and many are actually on local salaries."
22899,"or ""can we have a quota on foreign workers?"""
22900,But the racist in the vid is only 60.
22901,"Also, it's not really racism per se as I see that there are various holidays that the company is ignoring, not just for one single religion/race."
22902,"I listed my experience, to show why some like myself have biases against CECA."
22903,"But, if given a yes no question on if I like CECA, it would no."
22904,"You maybe dumbfounded to know, racism and a hierarchy of desirable partner along race, exist in the SG Gay Community."
22905,Ive been to NTU and met guys in hall that thinks its ok to be casually racist.
22906,I really dnt think racism is an old peoples problem.
22907,"Many young ppl are closeted racist, who just know what it takes to be politically correct in the public"
22908,You mean maid abuser Ng Jia Sheng?
22909,You mean migrant workers are human like the rest of us???
22910,"You mean the guy who dichotomises compassion and logic, and just brands everyone who bemoan racism or unjust treatment of our foreign workers as empty virtue signalling?"
22911,Hence it is justified to have high flow of foreign expats to flood of job markets.
22912,Such is an issue that is especially common within the expat community.
22913,Source: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/household-and-care-responsibilities-a-source-of-stress-for-more-than-half-of  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/12/covid-women-workload-domestic-caring/  https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/05/breadwinning-wives-gender-inequality/589237/  This doesn't negate our lack of regulation and protections for FDWs.
22914,We can definitely do more and we need to do more for our FDWs.
22915,"Anyway, I suppose you’re fighting against racism as well."
22916,"You might want to explore both sides of each party, I can imagine other land starved countries like HK to have barely any room for maids to sleep in."
22917,"I don't expect every family that hires a maid to be able to provide a private room for her, most likely shared with a child or an elderly parent."
22918,I know of a maid that recently ran away on her 2nd day because she didn't have her own room.
22919,Bash away all you want but the maids from the Philippines tend to pick up the worst habits possible from each other at church.
22920,"Stealing, bullying my siblings and bringing porn and a foreign worker into the house when no one was around was the absolute worst."
22921,My neighbour banged his maid but as soon as his wife left for a holiday he was a lost cause since he was on his 3rd marriage.
22922,"Treat my maids all the same, never physically touch but you have to know when to be a hard/soft manager at home so they don't overstep boundaries and pick up bad habits or slacking off."
22923,"Let's be realistic what these maids are here for, to make money for their family in their home country."
22924,My last maid was an Indonesian and preferred extra money to work on most of her days off which consisted mostly of eating out with my family.
22925,"My maid had a POS father and husband that leeched money off her, told her to cut off all ties and buy land for her future so she could support the rest of her family and retire comfortably."
22926,"As for the POS Singaporeans that don't know how to treat people like human, just ban them and any relatives living together from hiring maids."
22927,You might want to read that definition you have for racism.
22928,"Replacing foreign workers with domestic workers on roles that are menial and repetitive is a not a long term solution, exactly because of automation."
22929,I attended school in a racist town for a year in the US.
22930,You must be a fool if you don't think racism doesn't exist.
22931,"You suggested that if the gov fix the housing problem, then there'll be no more racism."
22932,"&#x200B;  You suggested that we should do something, but now you say all we need to do is to discuss about it and racism will fix itself."
22933,Take a look at this website that have videos with footballers and foreign workers talking about life in Qatar.
22934,"Get a job through the correct manner, I.e apply job, get the in principal approval for your employment pass, then come over."
22935,You can't compare students being punished at school to a domestic worker being emotionally abused while trying to achieve a better life for herself and for her family.
22936,You must have never seen the field pack maid.
22937,Obviously many expats belong to the former else they would have gone back.
22938,"For expats who don't understand why so many here are frustrated, try and think back to the bottom working class in your home countries and reflect on why they would support trump and brexit."
22939,"Fyi i'm from a family who hasn't hired a maid in about 15 years, and the families that I have seen (Singapore Chinse) have been treating their maids well, so I can't say much about this issue."
22940,Expats have less bargaining power because of quota on foreign workers.
22941,"Though I imagine if you're working as a skilled labour with qualifications that not many people have, you'll be paid higher regardless of whether you're an expat or local."
22942,You need to be in A VTL country for 14 straight days.
22943,"I'm of Indian ethnicity too btw, so don't try to pass it off as racism."
22944,You never read all the threads on racism that locals face ah?
22945,You obviously has a lack of understanding of CECA vs the other FTAs.
22946,Only the CECA has the clause on mutual recognition of standards in 4-5 major sectors of the economy to facilitate entry of Indian nationals in these sectors into S’pore.
22947,"In addition, only the CECA and 2 other FTAs have the cause on freedom of movement of persons in 127 professions."
22948,"And finally, the CECA’s clause on ICTs is very generous compared with other FTAs."
22949,"While other FTAs have maximum length of 5 years for their nationals to stay here, the CECA allows Indians to stay here for up to 8 years."
22950,You people think I'm inflammatory and racist.
22951,I want these migrant workers to LIVE.
22952,"Some people won't be able to afford it, most will realise the value of FDWs and find a way to afford it - by your logic we should pay everyone the same amount we pay FDWs."
22953,"Transphobia, racism, fat phobia, slut-shaming, islamophobia — those are not “different” opinions."
22954,You backward trump mentality to justify your racism is just hurting you in the long run.
22955,While at the same time rich expats have the red carpet rolled out.
22956,You realize the term expats don't mean migrant workers right?
22957,"If racism in Singapore is prevalent but unspoken, only to surface when someone triggers something, this gets me thinking."
22958,This newspaper is known for criticizing and making fun of racist politicians and policies.
22959,"I keep seeing belligerant comments that say ""is it racist if i do x"" as if to prove they are personally not, but individual actions make the collective whole of societal behavior."
22960,Yet you have racism-deniers every where you turn.
22961,You say it's racist but I say it's not.
22962,If you agree it should not be OK to select your tenant on race but it is OK to select your tenant based on whether or not he/she is an expat or at a certain age or gender then what is your reason and what principles are you basing that on?
22963,"You see vicious Singaporeans (and Hong Kongers too, to be fair) promulgating this ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese virus"" bullshit, not stopping to consider that when they travel, a racist isn't going to ask them where they come from before socking them in the faces."
22964,To be honest there are structural racism in sg and we should look into it but EIP is definitely not one of them.
22965,So can people like sudhir who is smart and respectable please clarify and not lead the masses to think that everything in sg is racist and against the minority?
22966,I really dislike when i see my neighbours maid cleaning their car every day when its not even close to be dirty.
22967,Once i was at family friends house where a maid got scolded for peeling the apple before cutting it.
22968,Or speaking in this loud obnoxious voice like the maid is retarted when she understand perfectly fine.
22969,Or those who have cleaning obsession asking maid clean constantly.
22970,Or those who ask maids to go work in relatives houses.
22971,I have so many small anecdotes about this type of mindset towards maids.
22972,"In this case, the maid seems to have been charged under Section 182."
22973,"You should also read the case again - the ""evidence"" that turned up in the phone was simply that the man seemed to be having an affair with the maid."
22974,"It is not evidence that the man never raped the maid, since obviously you can still rape someone that you are in a relationship/affair with."
22975,"If the maid truly was being prevented from going back to Indonesia and lied because she felt like she had to in order to go home, then this is clearly a relevant mitigating factor."
22976,The Singaporeans that earn at this level are not going to be offered an expat package in another major industrialised country any time soon.
22977,"You should be able to open a bank account with nothing more than your passport, EP, and proof of residential address ([source](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/for-expatriates/how-to-apply.page))."
22978,"You should check out this analysis on the movie IP man 4, i found the 2nd  movie series antagonist unashamedly more racist than whats portrayed in the 4th, but i haven't watch the entirety of it, just clips here and there."
22979,This is not xenophobic.
22980,It’s referring to those who are bad to maids and who complain about their own bosses.
22981,My point is those who are bad to maids are likely the bad bosses at work themselves.
22982,"You shouldn't feel sorry for ranting, all racists deserve to be mocked and scorned."
22983,"The irony of Singaporeans being racist towards South Asians while condemning it in the West, like the case with the Singaporean kid who was beat up in London, is laughable."
22984,You shouldn't treat a maid in this way either.
22985,Nowhere did I say or even imply that the racist Chinese guy is PRC.
22986,She might not feel like she is abusing the maid.
22987,You talk about not justifying/supporting racism and the need to  recognise the root of racism when your own comments show bigotry... and to then add on you then say failure to solve it must therefore blame the gov...   No.
22988,This racism is an issue of the public.
22989,Want to talk about solving racism?
22990,Look in the mirror first  People like you contribute to the racism/xenophobia in Singapore and you dont even realise it..
22991,You talk as if singkie employing a maid is for altruism reason lol.
22992,Do you have the slightest sense that calling someone a racist is a very serious allegation here?
22993,Who is left holding the can here if the FDW loses her passport and overstays- let you know something it's not the FDW- the employer is responsible until she is back in her home country.
22994,Come back when you have hired and managed your own FDW.
22995,"I understand the law needs to protect the most, vulnerable, hence it usually is in the FDWs favour."
22996,Full of xenophobic savages over there.
22997,So a 15 year old calls an Indian kid smelly and just says “I find him smelly to my nose but not because he’s Indian” and suddenly it’s not racist?
22998,You think it's gross and racism but you didn't tell it to him clearly.
22999,I know how hard is already for you Singaporeans there and being some random guy not on expat package probably makes it quite difficult.
23000,"You think we're bad, Qatar is like 95% foreign workers from Bangladesh and India."
23001,The only time I have ever experienced racism in the states was during elementary school where kids were ignorant and mean.
23002,This is despite transporting workers who get among the lowest wages in the developed world in the back of lorries.
23003,A previous MNC i worked for sent their local production operators on expat package to Germany to finish off production since they want to close down the line.
23004,"So any roles can have expat, just depends on how desperate the company is to want to pay for it."
23005,"If you continue down this path of just browsing Reddit for help, you're going to end up as just someone who lives in an expat bubble."
23006,Completely destroyed my self confidence and opened my eyes to the casual racism in singapore.
23007,Kudos for standing up against xenophobia.
23008,You asked if it was racist if a woman didn't want to go out with you because you are Indian.
23009,I lived in Australia for a few years and the racism and xenophobia was argubably worse than in Singapore.
23010,"In Singapore, you dont have that racism, but locals are disastified that they are struggling to get jobs while expats are coming from countries with much higher standards of living and they get paid a TON...i have actually read an expat forum and the expats there just talk about how they get huge allowances from their company so that they can afford to buy a condo and car when they first come here."
23011,VTL can do yourself.
23012,And it's not as simple as because people are racist.
23013,I can confirmatively say Singaporeans are the most xenophobic people I've ever met.
23014,"But obviously this is a generalization, I've met some wonderful and incredible Singaporeans who are as far from xenophobic as possible."
23015,"As I mentioned, the subreddit has a lot of people who are okay with casual racism and don't even think it is racist at all."
23016,You won't notice racism until you're a  minority.
23017,"That's why you often hear stories of racism from Chinese in Malaysia, Malays in Singapore, Asians in Australia, South Asians in Gulf countries etc."
23018,"After seeing the quality of these clowns, how can I not be against Indian IT ""professionals"" brought in with higher salary than me, due to CECA?"
23019,One issue you’re going to face is racism.
23020,The only visible racism you MAY face is while looking for housing.
23021,You'll find much more help at forum.singaporexpats.com  however SCT is the correct way but can be hard if you don't have an name/address to serve notice to.
23022,"Though you could maybe find some Swedes in the expat community in Singapore who would be willing to house you for a week or so just to get you started once you arrive, and to help you out."
23023,"Perhaps this is just due to lack of exposure to racial groups outside of the Asiansphere and isn't entirely ""racism"" in the typical sense."
23024,But at the end of the day they harbour just as much racism and ill will as any other person - they just tend to mask it better.
23025,"I remember primary school,we all had like a very black and white view of race,probably because the math problems were somehow the most diverse set of math questions in the world,featuring CMIO."
23026,White people are excluded from intra-asian racism.
23027,"Funnily enough this parallels america, where chinese people in the 50s took the white section of the bus, excluded from the anti-black racism of the time."
23028,"Like what American SJWs love to say, you can't be racist towards whites."
23029,So in Singapore by that logic you can't be racist towards Chinese.
23030,"You can say the meanest things, make slanty eye impressions and ching-chong accents and it's not racism."
23031,"Their logic relies on redefining racism as a form of oppression, and since the privileged are the oppressors and not the oppressed, you can't be racist towards them."
23032,Dont be racist yourself.
23033,"Long before demographics put a brake on immigration, you'd find a point where investing in child-rearing is better than paying a premium for immigrants/expats - simple supply demand."
23034,"The restaurants usually don't bother if you bring your maid to the table (at least those I've been to) as long as you are paying, but some families may not want their maids at the same table for whatever reason."
23035,"You because you're trying to say a racist thing is not racist, Sixchar because he's trying to prove Chinese people can be treated in a racist way too (no shit, Sherlock)."
23036,I assume that you're one of those ivory-tower types who just don't understand how hard it is for our fellow citizens to compete against foreigners that came as a result of our flawed and unfair immigration policy.
23037,"Are you saying that what their sufferings and anger are invalid and have no meaning, and that they're just being xenophobic?"
23038,"You're confusing critical public health deliverables (typically class agnostic) with economic policy differences (the likes of which are mirrored in the SG citizen / expat experience)  Australia is by no means perfect, but this is an apples v oranges comparison."
23039,You're confusing xenophobia with the disagreement / disliking of Singapore's immigration policies.
23040,Saying xenophobia is fine is like saying racism is fine.
23041,You're either extremely ignorant or just flat out racist and looking to get your ass beat.
23042,"Many individuals part of a minority do not feel like enough is being done to tackle the racism they face, which is why they're calling out the privilege that exists."
23043,"You're flying at a peak travel time with, apparently, little flexibility and then you're dealing with Singapore unnecessarily constraining flights with its VTLs."
23044,You're forgetting the biggest scam of all....the actual VTL flight.
23045,"I booked a flight to the UK and it was a decent price .....comparative to the old days....then I realized it wasn't a VTL flight and I would require to quarantine for 7-10 days on return (depending on the MOH saveur du jour when I return) so I went ahead and booked a VTL flight, and it was approx 2.5-3x the cost."
23046,I had to travel for exams so I had no choice but they're really milking this VTL for all it's worth.
23047,These are some of the most common excuses used to reject these applicants from housing enquiries and it's just plain ol' racism.
23048,"Secondly, you are using the *domestic worker pass* to judge our immigration policy."
23049,"Third, domestic workers aside you have no idea what Singapore's immigration policies are like."
23050,We are [swarming with immigrants](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/rapid-growth-singapores-immigrant-population-brings-policy-challenges).
23051,"But then, if you can't imagine a country with 33% immigrants, neither can you imagine a country with no political spectrum."
23052,More international students have committed suicide in western countries than expats have died in Singapore.
23053,"However, there is little concern to the privileged class of 1%er expats who come here for the tax benefits."
23054,Yeah dawg that's racist.
23055,Who said that just because we're fighting for Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) rights mean that none of us give a shit about foreign construction workers?
23056,"The fact is that this thread is about FDWs - and if asked, I'm sure many of us will concur that foreign construction workers are unfairly treated as well."
23057,&#x200B;  Legitimately requiring a full-time caregiver at home for medical reasons is not a problem meant to be solved by a FDW.
23058,It is **OUR** responsibility to clean it up; not act like we're doing FDWs a favour by employing them so that they have jobs.
23059,"You're living in some sort of buddhist-inspired blue pill fantasy world and for that, you deserved to be treated and abused by your own maid."
23060,Endure your maid's wrath?
23061,Are you sure you're not the maid instead?!
23062,"For one, you're engaging in mental gymnastics trying to justify your racism."
23063,"You are buying into a false, fascistic scapegoat narrative that is being peddled by Trump and the rest of his inbred nepotistic regime - that conditions in the US are a direct result of the Chinese/ immigrants/ WHO/ political opposition, instead of criminal malfeasance by Donald Trump in obfuscating, lying, failing to prepare, systematic defunding of necessary state apparatus (by multiple US administrations), anti-intellectual denialism, cronyism, and the undue influence of capital in the US government."
23064,MY side announced suspension of VTLs with us from our end we stop the selling of tickets for all VTL so in theory they still exist but basically no one who haven't bought a ticket yet will be able to leave the country.
23065,I know because my father was an immigrant from HK and it was very difficult for him to get a permit to work in Singapore as an expat in the 70's.
23066,But a look at the downvotes on some comments in this thread tells me there's still denial of how pervasive racism is.
23067,"Found it:   https://i.imgur.com/4bmJipB.png  Honestly, expats complaining here are just late to the game of musical chairs."
23068,Never seen any expats complaining about ez PRs and citizenships back then.
23069,"By definition, the aim of the govt's goal of increasing resilience inevitably equates to reducing reliance on expats."
23070,"It means that the threshold for what constitutes a talent is greatly raised, which will, of course, upset many mid to mid-high tier expats."
23071,edit:  Noticed how kiasu-meister whom you replied to is also an expat of 8 years who just left.
23072,The maid has also publicly said she forgives the family and just wants to move on.
23073,You're racist if you're assuming he is a male chauvinist without seeing it for yourself.
23074,Race basically ramps up the income requirement for non-CMI expats.
23075,"I work with a lot of expats, and those on PEP (minimum income of $12k/month) all got their PRs on their first application after working here for almost a decade."
23076,"Work permit holders (in construction, cleaning) and domestic helpers are higher priority than EP holders as most locals aren't ready to take those jobs."
23077,"[What MOM cares about](http://Businesses, families would have been severely hit if Singapore had closed borders to migrant workers: MOM https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/businesses-families-would-have-been-severely-hit-if-singapore-closed-its-borders-to)"
23078,"You're right that this is a marketing campaign, but it's also a nice and thoughtful thing that McDonalds did to bring cheer to the migrant workers."
23079,"(about that it might be coincidental)  It's just that now whenever anything racist happens I'm on this sort of ""edge"" and  sometimes I overthink these things a lot."
23080,"You're right, any city in the world with a high proportion of foreigners has some degree of xenophobia."
23081,The difference is that in other cities people recognise it as xenophobia while in Singapore we try to justify it as rational anxieties regarding immigration.
23082,"You're right, but unfortunately as we know, racism is still around us, some times subtle, other times crudely."
23083,"In this era racism is one of the thing I would often wonder why it still exist, but I guess there are just many underlying factors to address."
23084,"You already did great by encouraging your daughter to reciprocate the wave back and engaging the foreign worker with some talk, thumbs up!"
23085,"Pioneer lodge (10,500) pays about 750k on monthly rent (https://www.edgeprop.sg/amp/property-news/next-generation-foreign-workers’-dormitory) and above comment has Tuas View at 1.16m/month."
23086,"Why would I, an immigrant, spend decades of my life trying to scratch out a place in a country that will literally never stop hating me and wanting me gone, regardless of what I do?"
23087,"My point, which could probably have been phrased more clearly, was that ""systemic racism"" is when the racism is present in just about every aspect of life, and treated as *normal* and ""just the way things are"", which is another level from merely ""widespread"" (which might not be considered ""normal"", but just unfortunately common)."
23088,"It's a bit more subtle, driven by racist undertones, suggesting that they deserved it."
23089,But taking care of 4 kids and not expecting the maid to break is unrealistic.
23090,"What more a lonely migrant worker who works 6 days a week, and sleep where she works at?"
23091,"If we think the issue can be simply condensed to 'maid guilty for hitting baby', then our society still has a long way to go."
23092,I think McDonald's clearly donated this food because they want migrant workers addicted to Coca Cola.
23093,For those in the thread arguing it is the mother tongue.
23094,"Excepting Malay, of whom themselves are also Javanese and Balinese, Indians, who are yet more diverse, and Chinese who tmd who's ah ma speak Mandarin natively, it's largely not even the actual mother tongue."
23095,These kids clearly are liberal pro-LGBT anti-racist woke kids.
23096,"An immigration policy that strictly matches incoming people, demographically, to citizens, offers a strong reply to that criticism."
23097,"The only thing things that seem illegal here is the employees doing work outside of the agreed job scope, like the chauffeur, the IT staff turned tea lady, and the maid working at the business rather than the home, but I got a feeling that this can be easily argued and lawyered away by someone of her stature."
23098,You're saying:  > You see I didn't mention the recent cases of racism is due to colonialism.
23099,"But in my opinion, we Chinese are very comfortable with being racist due to years of cultural indoctrination that the value of a person is based on their financial worth and value and minorities do not do as well (even though this notion is entirely false) is due to their failings as a culture."
23100,This is racist as fuck and we chinese have to do better.
23101,> Academia is all about uncovering truth but they do go down the wrong path and they do chase absolutely stupid leads or their racist intuition.
23102,You're struggling to explain your point because it isn't racist.
23103,"Furthermore, you're trying hard to play mental gymnastics in order to find something racist about it because we live in a hyper racialised world that focuses too much on constructs like race."
23104,"According to wikipedia (and literally every dictionary definition), an expat is just someone who doesn't live in his native country."
23105,He is by definition an expat.
23106,You're the one Asian friend she uses for moral license and prood to herself that she's not actually racist.
23107,"I was reacting to your sentence  ""Stop this senseless mass immigration, it seems like almost anyone can get an employment pass these days"" which is totally untrue."
23108,"I come from an immigrant background myself and I (evidently) like to argue about immigration on /r/Singapore, so how xenophobic my MP candidate is is a huge factor to me."
23109,But you're right that immigrants aren't a monolith.
23110,I think a part of me also secretly wants to live in a world in which first and second generation immigrant voters voted for more liberal policies based on their solidarity with migrant workers and newer immigrants.
23111,"It's less depressing than the reality, which is that descendents of immigrants are by no means immune to xenophobia and nativism."
23112,This is most clearly evidenced by the fact that there are third generation immigrants living in Singapore today that are telling newer first generation immigrations to go back to where they came from.
23113,"You, as the person asserting that being a maid is the same as slavery, ought to be the one providing the proof."
23114,You've admitted that you _don't even know who the migrant workers in the US are_.
23115,What do you know about the plight of migrant workers?
23116,Some choice quotes about how you don't know who unskilled migrant workers in the US even are and whether they exist: > The equivalent work pass visa in the states is the h1b visa which is for more white collar jobs.
23117,> They make in 1 hour what a migrant worker makes in 1 day in Singapore.
23118,You _literally_ were trying to compare racism between citizens in the US and treatment of unskilled migrant workers in Singapore.
23119,The only time I have ever experienced racism in the states was during elementary school where kids were ignorant and mean.
23120,A family with young children hires a domestic worker to help out with house chores and taking care of the children.
23121,Your integrity and status is no better/higher than your domestic worker.
23122,"At first glance, I thought that you had posted OYK's response and I was shocked that he quoted LKY's racist words."
23123,"Them, expat and rich: Support economy by having bubbly champagne brunch."
23124,"Kid wasn’t being racist, and no adult should feel offended at such behaviour."
23125,"Young, relatively healthy migrant workers got infected en masse to produce an artificially low Covid-19 case fatality rate, so that PAP can brag about it."
23126,Your 2nd statement is unnecessary xenophobic.
23127,I am not in favor of the motion brought by LMW in the parliament and I think the CECA issue is blown out-of-proportion with racial undertone.
23128,That’s the definition of not being racist.
23129,That’s the exact same point made for not being a racist.
23130,Your argument is pointing towards a belief that being racist towards indivuduals is excusable because of the issues they bring in AS A WHOLE.
23131,"workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available in the geographic area where the immigrant is to be employed and that no American workers are displaced by foreign workers""  Singapore instead practises a quota and levy system for the bottom half (which you aren't interested in), and a theoretically unlimited system for the top half (Employment Passes)."
23132,Your business is racist.
23133,Assigning attributes and stereotypes to a whole race of people is racism defined.
23134,Whether you want to say racism is ok or not morally is obviously a conversation we can have.
23135,But you don’t get to be racist and pretend you are not.
23136,There's already a cap on the agent fees Singaporean agencies can charge foreign workers.
23137,The exorbitant and unregulated fees that the foreign workers end up paying and the one that Kirsten Han refers to in the article are paid in their HOME countries which Singapore does not have any jurisdiction over.
23138,">Having said this, there are also cases where foreign workers paid high agency fees to EAs in their home countries before coming to Singapore."
23139,A mum was trying to coax her child to come towards her but the child was screaming and crying and didn't want to be separated from their maid.
23140,"After people explain the gaslighting and/or racism the answer is basically ""sorry, I don't see how"" followed by a wholesale rejection of the premise."
23141,"Even with regards to the assertion of what they did being racist, PA's entire defence amounts to being ""culturally sensitive"" while pretending like that is the logical end to it as if there is no racial element?"
23142,"Of course people are going to bring up race, and racism."
23143,"They can defend all they want, but the PA/govt doesn't decide what is racist and what isn't."
23144,"Many domestic workers aren't simply resigned to getting shit wages here, because it is not a shit wage for them."
23145,A domestic worker in the Philippines  is paid about SGD$80-130 a month and the work is a lot tougher than in Singapore.
23146,A maid’s employer is.
23147,"Lets now look at the consequences of letting the dorm cluster blow up: 1. a greater strain on healthcare resources, both infrastructure and personnel alike 2. an extension of the circuit breaker that would have greater economic costs 3. backlash against the treatment of migrant workers 4."
23148,Police brutality is one manifestation of racism.
23149,"Will there be a WLM (White Lifes Matter)"" it obviously shows you have never read about racism."
23150,"Please read about racism, sociology of race, social class, the history of the police in the US and what it was built upon instead of posing baseless questions."
23151,"Look at it this way: he’s generous because he sees his friends; most likely fellow Singaporeans; worthy of his kindness, but when it comes to someone who is a foreign domestic helper, he immediately puts them into stereotypes and look down on him/her."
23152,"I treat my domestic helper really nicely and make her feel like she’s part of my family because, imagine if you’re in her shoes: alone, far from home and family."
23153,Those people are often the first ones to be extremely racist towards Chinese immigrants or anyone who still maintains cultural ties to their original Asian country.
23154,"It is just intellectually lazy to assume all Chinese looking people should keep in touch with their roots, even if those roots left 100 years ago, and your PRC friend is no different from other racists/purists."
23155,"I've had domestic helpers in my household for over 10 years and most never stayed on for more than their 2 year contract because my late grandma would go apeshit and be really mean to them (making them always have short hair cuts, raising her voice and making ridiculous demands)."
23156,"Your last bit... I’m inclined to agree but anecdotally I’ve seen a lot of racist Chinese Singaporeans... in NS, Chinese landlords who refuse to rent out of non Chinese, and list goes on."
23157,Your last para is probably the main reason for your dad's racism.
23158,Your logic can be applied to excuse any form of racism.
23159,The motivation of why they are racist is irrelevant.
23160,It’s still racist and you defending it allows this racism to persist.
23161,"The same way we can and should talk about LGBT discrimination, mistreatment of migrant workers, the class divide, etc."
23162,"People’s feeds are flooded with #blackouttuesday and #blm, and most of these people (in SG) have literally never had to confront the idea of racism before."
23163,"We can talk about George Floyd AND talk about mistreatment of migrant workers in SG, and these comparisons and broader view of what racism at its root looks like in different contexts can BENEFIT the conversation and deepen understanding of the issue at large."
23164,"I have become very close friends with alot of expats in my company, I know where you're coming from, just bite your teeth and approach some of them."
23165,Thus back home I tend to be very friendly with my expats colleagues.
23166,Which is usually a big culture shock to most of the expats.
23167,"In my previous company, I had an expat who newly joined."
23168,There was once I was in reservist and I had to report to work while in reservist and I didn't have the time to change to normal clothes so I reported to work in my formal military attire and so many expats were so shocked they kept looking at me as if I was some zoo animal.
23169,"I have became very close to my expats colleuges, I don't consider them just colleagues."
23170,"Your pass would be an EP, not an S pass, also there’s ‘secret levels’ within an employment pass and yours would be classified as P1 because of the salary, meaning no issues."
23171,"Your point, was that the VTL would lead to  > massive import of ‘FT’ to fire up the economy and marginalise local workers in 3… 2… 1…  At which point someone asked whether you had a similar reaction when borders with China were open or when VTL with Europe was established."
23172,But its clear that you are just looking for an excuse to make a racist and xenophobic comment.
23173,"With this attitude, it's no wonder you can't find a job and cry immigrant."
23174,"I don’t ever think I’ll forget my first encounter with racism, I was 8 and my class was standing in line for assembly."
23175,"My hand accidentally brushed against this Chinese girls arm and she immediately started brushing her arm (as though she was removing dust) and said something along the lines “I don’t want to be dirty like you”  I still do encounter racism even now unfortunately, whether it be people shifting seats after I sit next to them or everyone around me speaking in Chinese when I’m in the conversation and the only minority."
23176,"Sometimes when people try to pretend racism doesn’t exist here, it gets frustrating."
23177,"Also with racist,inappropriate jokes from friends, I usually calmly ask them to repeat it."
23178,"They do fuckall but due to their skin, you can’t help brown nosing them  Get rid of that backwards racist mindset u dog"
23179,"Making expat friends, should be no probem."
23180,"This is the part where you sided with foreigners instead of Singaporeans, by implying / bringing racism into the picture."
23181,There is no racism between Singaporeans in Singapore.
23182,But that seems to be a sliver of the local  expat population (and I explicitly referred to someone with 3-4 years of experience).
23183,"Holland, Orchard, Clarke Quay, etc are high for expat but also high in cost."
23184,Maybe a fellow expat has a room in a condo to spare.
23185,Still trying to find excuses to justify racism?
23186,"Many people say that racism isn’t bad in Singapore but many do not know how it feels to be looked at with malice, disgust and hate."
23187,I always focus on Tammy’s mom whenever I face racism.
23188,Your vaccination proof will need to be issued by a VTL country.
23189,Your words exemplify this third world mentality...and we might all be better off if a maid (who you might have had respect for) raised you.
23190,You’ll be better off looking for answers with the [SG expat forum](https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewforum.php?f=85&sid=60f4efa9d04cbc687d1f7c01506507df).
23191,"And OP is looking at something that is 1BR, 800sqft - if he / she is willing to look beyond the typically expatty areas he can get something more than decent for WAY less."
23192,"The controversy also was purely xenophobic because it wasn’t about his job effectiveness but completely about him being a jerk, and that foreigners should somehow be on better behaviour than our own jerks."
23193,You think they are going to admit they are racist towards her Indian bf?
23194,You’re here hiring a domestic worker complaining about cost and asking for subsidies.
23195,"You’re not an expat, you’re an immigrant."
23196,"Being a foreigner in another country does not automatically make you an expat, much less with a S$2.6k rental budget."
23197,"You’re not even trying to hide your racism, are you?"
23198,"Edit: Let’s just say if a Singaporean killed a migrant worker, they won’t get away with it under our court system."
23199,"Giving in to her stupid racist request is undermining the professionalism of all involved, the vaccinator and the supervisor."
23200,It’s ok to treat our foreign workers like garbage - how else are we gonna get our big pretty buildings like MBS at a bargain price amirite?
23201,"Anyway, I’m saying how immigration does not help improve falling birth rate which is one of the main reasons cited by the government in the past for such lax immigration policy."
23202,"I know expats who are on 30-50k a month packages, not including ancillaries like schooling and housing."
23203,I know expats who rent GCBs.
23204,I know expats where both husband and wife are working and earning a lot.
23205,Does this mean that all expats have the same life?
23206,Of course not but don’t make it’s kind like every expat in Singapore is suffering.
23207,"As someone else said, this is also focused largely on the western expats and ignores the foreign labor from other neighbouring countries who live very different lifestyles."
23208,Anyone has the right against racism and I don’t think we need to know the accolades.
23209,"Yup as one comment put it, Japan and Korea don't really have a low wage migrant worker force, hence they don't even have the concept of FDWs."
23210,Yup expat leaving isn't a uniquely singapore problem.
23211,Yup lol I got downvoted for saying the guy is a hard core oppo supporter who is racist and believes in fake news lol
23212,Yup makes sense especially when 75% of the imported cases were on VTL /s
23213,Yup minorities can be racist.
23214,"Its not racist, its insensitive."
23215,Yup protection by allowing violent racist actions on foreigners to fester.
23216,This is the kind of racist rhetoric I dealt with growing up in Singapore as an Indian kid in the 90s.
23217,Yup that’s pretty racist to me.
23218,"Wonder what trauma has the lady suffered during past injections in her life but since the vaccination is free, she shouldn’t try to be picky/racist."
23219,I wonder if rejecting her vaccination because of racist comments will work but this have to stop somewhere!
23220,"Yup the EDMW thread on the interracial couple was filled with awful remarks against miscegenation, and racist criticism of Shanmugam as per normal."
23221,Yup the closest with have to a  local domestic helper
23222,Yup their common rallying call is CECA CECA CECA.
23223,"Yup yup, not about credentials and yet you're telling me I'm not old enough or knowledgeable enough to know, suggesting that only you're old enough or knowledgeable enough to know if racism has always been around in Singapore."
23224,"If it's difficult for you to see racism in the 21st century, I don't know how easy it was for you in the 20th century."
23225,The case was very strong to start VTL.
23226,Their actions must show that the life and welfare of the migrant workers are not less worthy of any human.
23227,"But if your trip is super vanilla (book VTL flight, have QR code for vaccine that confirms to the format, paid your testing, and complete your Arrival Card 3 days prior), there’s nothing to worry about."
23228,My comment was in regards to the various racists comments
23229,"I think the point I'm making is that an expat package is by its very nature transient and could end at any time, so I don't understand why the article makes it seem that an expat position in Singapore was pursued for stability?"
23230,"Yup, Thian Hock Keng is the oldest Hokkien temple in Singapore, built by immigrants from Fujian."
23231,"Yup, VTLs are bilateral agreements."
23232,"Yup, and probably all chinese people downvoting me because they dont experience that kind of racism."
23233,If i recall there were often questions from expats and tourists where many sgreans contribute and even organized meetups
23234,"Yup, it's pretty simple for most of the expatriates that are leaving."
23235,"Just like how locals who caught Covid but had mild symptoms went to D’Resort (a place that people would previously pay to go on staycation), while infected migrant workers went to Expo cubicles."
23236,"Yup, people who have even 1 case of maid abuse should never be allowed to hire another (perma ban!)."
23237,Many expat families tend to have local friends among elite circles - who seem to have  a more patronising idea of other races than the average Singaporean.
23238,I have a relative whose wife is an expat.
23239,"Yup, unjustifiably calling people racist is the mark of maturity."
23240,That’s being racist to the Filipinos.
23241,"In their own terms they think its a literal description that is pretty civil (i have no idea if its considered racist back in their day), but in today's day and age its highly derogatory."
23242,"If they say there is no racism in Singapore, that is."
23243,For foreign workers this is most difficult.
23244,Not one instance of racism (having said that I have a certain level of privilege because I pretty much code to Brits as middle class British Indian) active or passive as compared to the usual passive racism or racial cluelessness in Singapore.
23245,"I was there for 4 years, never ever experienced racism."
23246,"Besides more overt anti-East Asian racism though, part of the problem SG Chinese face is the shock of not being the norm and thus having to suddenly face the microaggressions and minor acts of thoughtlessness minorities are inured to."
23247,So that means that there are just a lot of migrant workers who come here for a potential better life for their families but end up thinking suicide is better.
23248,"You can get a trained nanny but because she cost as much as a maid while being entitled to offs, vacation time and being able to go home, you don't want to do that."
23249,"FYI, my mum had breast cancer, my stepdad is in his 60s and they die die don't want a maid."
23250,I would rather get a trained care worker to care for my parents and pay extra for trained care than trusting them to a young maid.
23251,"If you want a maid, better treat them properly, not like a slave just because you pay a pittance of a salary."
23252,"My argument is in favor of treating maids better and until Singaporeans can do that, I don't think you deserve a maid."
23253,"We will all agree we are racist, laugh and move on."
23254,I don't see how publishing every event you feel is racist is going to help one bit except sully the image of Singapore and make sensitive people wary of each other.
23255,"People only ever do surveys and research on the existence of discrimination due to stereotypes, but no one ever thinks of gathering data on the truthfulness of individual racial stereotypes... probably because it would be seen as racist if the results came up positive."
23256,"Too many people here look at an aspect (foreign workers) and think of all kind of quick fixes but the reality is so so much more scary - so much of Singapore depends on construction, from MRT lines to Coastal Climate Change Defenses to BTO to re-development - it's the constant renewal and reacting to external challenges that keeps this country afloat  and competitive (it's delusional to think that we can just slowly become a 'normal backwater country' - it discards that humans are neither able nor willing to lose standard of living, it universally ends in violence and chaos)  Retooling this industry will come with incredible pain, investment and sacrifices, sacrifices voters will not be willing to make (e.g."

23301,"She seemed, on paper at least, the ideal expat - arriving with her  partner right before Covid-19."
23302,And as workplaces  clamp down on hiring it could further limit the options for expats who  have long seen a stint in Asia as an important and lucrative experience.
23303,"The Singapore government has added to their angst by taking steps to  promote local hiring, raising concern that it will come at the expense  of expats."
23304,"And in May, it tightened the framework that governs employment passes  for foreigners, increasing the minimum monthly salary to S$3,900 and  further expanding rules requiring employers to advertise job openings to  locals first."

23370,"migrant worker housing should be a nationalised industry or at the very least, private but heavily regulated."

23378,a lot of the migrant workers also can drive class 3/4/5 vehicles.

23387,"but yes maids are never treated as an equal, there is the distinction."
23388,most maids here have proper rights still.
23389,"on a side note, i think i heard more stories about dishonest maid or abusive maids than ill-treated maids."
23390,not calling landlords racist while you yourself stand on a moral high ground and filtering out based on what you think is right to do so.
23391,"thanks to the awareness raised, we have much more access to resources on how to become anti-racist which will be so useful to apply to the conversations we’ll have about race/equality/human rights in Singapore."

23393,"The unhappiness here is over the policies with regards to bringing in of foreign talent, etc, and CECA is an example of a policy."
23394,"Because once that is brought in, once people keep saying 'CECA Indians' or keep saying 'PRCs blah blah', the focus might turn to race, there will be people who irresponsibly try to drive up emotions by using race."
23395,Singapore should never go down the slope of being racist.
23396,"why are we so insensitive and racist, act like we're all right also."
23397,yeah working retail really shows you a lot of hidden (and blatant) racism and xenophobia.
23398,"We have a very liberal immigration policy for a developed nation, and it's only natural that it's very enticing for someone from a developing country to come here."

23401,"i mean pyscopaths can form from both sides boss and employee alike, but i think with also the sleughof news about the horrors of maid abuse there is reason to question the victim actually being the victim."
23402,if not rip and the maid should just get the death sentence too.
23403,"and despite examples such as this, people on this sub will claim that xenophobia doesn't exist."
23404,"and domestic helper 'maids', and foreign workers too"
23405,and downright racism towards ang mohs in singapore.
23406,ppl justify it cos of what they felt in western countries dont like feeling like the minority in another country so they pick on the minority in sg.. u dont have to shout on a public bus to go back to ur country for ang mohs to hear and feel the racism.
23407,in a way its a more sinister subtle racism portrayed.
23408,and reddit scarily shows how racism to ang mohs is well received.
23409,and it's always the innocent non-racist people that are on the receiving end of their racist behaviors...maybe we should round all these racist people up to throw them into an arena and let them duke it out among themselves..
23410,"and maids in SG have zero expenses, some actually save every cent and can go home with a lot of cash"
23411,"and redditporeans always like to sprout amdk amdk rhetoric, talking about white supremacy, getting upvotes on misinformation and racism."
23412,and redditporeans love their echo chamber racism towards ang moh in sg.

23419,are you saying the maids enjoy hard working conditions?
23420,article is talking about racism not xenophobia...
23421,"I understand I'm not the most focused or competent, but it rlly hurts when ur own parents only believe that ur treated with discrimination  at work because of my status as a singaporean when she hear co workers share of their experiences as a singaporean..why is it so easy to believe that it can be racism when it's towards malays and Indians, but all the races always seem to believe when it comes to my race its not."
23422,as far as i know the minimum wage for helpers is being controlled by the sg gov in coordination with the government where the maid is comming from.
23423,"as in that is what happened, they fired her and got a new maid."
23424,"as per Critical Race Theory, as a racial minority I am without structural power and oppressed and thus I cannot be racist."

23427,"as you said, racism is racism, why are we comparing anything to begin with."
23428,then here you are comparing the amount of racism received by either groups (in bold no less).
23429,at first when u shared that he held ur last payment & that u were a foreign worker i wanted to say that it could be that they filed tax clearance and hence had to hold onto ur last month salary until they have cleared the directive w IRAS however if this isn’t the reason u should rly escalate this w MOM.
23430,">As for expats, I said above, I would not have to match anything as it would just be priced into the total compensation package we would negotiate for."
23431,"but you forget that not every expat will justify the cost, it depends on which side you are on."
23432,"automation to migrant workers & in-charges is nearly impossible, entire hierarchy are not educated in tech, dont know how its gonna work."
23433,spend more time with children and give maids their dayoff.

23436,based on this logic racial harmony is against our evolutionary roots lol and racism is innate in us?
23437,safer transport for foreign workers?

23440,"because more enlightened discourses have more precisely scoped racism as a structural, institutional, systemic phenomenon that can coincide with prevailing individual prejudices, but exists independently of any one person's prejudices."
23441,"This doesn't make it racism, in the more nuanced sense."
23442,because most of them don’t even realise it’s racism.
23443,because the maid cant vote and so their rights really dont matter as much
23444,he said the teacher was racist that he picked a chinese over him.
23445,being racist is of course not a good thing.
23446,"holding back information is definitely not one way of combating racism, in fact it’ll only make things worse"
23447,"believe me i am no proponent of EDMW myself (it's a forum i've not ventured since 2010) but knowing actual faces there as opposed to the people in this sub, where uncomfortable replies, 'offending' topics are just downvoted till oblivion....i rather talk with racists that spout racist nonsense in my face than self-professed 'liberals' spouting the most political correct and 'safe' comments but harbor 'god knows what' psychological issues deep down."
23448,'in your face' racism is more 'comfortable' than 'i am not racist but...' commentators to me.
23449,Look at all the borderline xenophobic upvoted comments about the HK protests here and the lazy and easy retort of 'wumao' to anyone that goes against the narrative.
23450,Nothing wrong with being called a maid.
23451,"I feel like the term ""helper"" has come about to assuage people's guilt for paying their 3rd world maids so little."
23452,bias is not racism.
23453,"get real, she is a malaysian, the boyfriend is a malaysian, and so they came from a country where racism is in the law."
23454,"classic selfish human beings, though i do understand why the expats who are committed to singapore are complaining (since they are being treated the same as many other expats who use SG to only to get PR, among other benefits such as kids’ education and low tax, before going back)."
23455,"is grey area lah, i also like to make these jokes, and for the most part my minority friends know i not racist bc they know how i feel about these issues."
23456,bro the racism here is highly highly overstated by this sub.
23457,"I won't deny there's racism in workplaces, but it's definitely not as widespread as you think."
23458,"I also kena scold by Indian, I don't call her racist for that."
23459,Want to fight racism can at least aim the correct target anot
23460,"bro... to be racist is to be prejudiced against a person based purely on their race lol, thats the literal definition of the word, its a non subjective fact, minorities can be racist against the majority, it just happens way less; people like OP(of the comment, not the post) just fail 2 grasp the concept of reading and taking in the post from the point of view of the majority and they instead take it as a personal attack on them or their loved ones(who probably arent racist, benefit of the doubt) when as a member of the majority, theyre more likely to be outliers esp when stories like these are so prevalent  edit: this was just to try and understand why theyre acting the way they are but id also like to add that i am chinese and i too had that same mentality and would get offended etc."
23461,brudder your grandfudder grandmudder also immigrant leh
23462,"bruh, did you just call maid abuse a mistake"
23463,but VTLs have the intentional effect of focusing crowd onto SQ flights.. good for them
23464,but are you saying it's racist not to allow others?
23465,would not allowing anyone to keep long hair be more or less racist than only allowing Sikh males?
23466,but employers are not legally liable for their maids loans right?
23467,"As a minority, whenever i face racist circumstances like this one, i feel too annoyed to even the serve a blatantly racist person."
23468,but i dun understand why the maid said she don't know to say she wishes to have more food if her employer is so nice to her.
23469,the problem with implicit subtle racism is that there are still A LOT of majority-membered people who think minorities are being dramatic when we say that racism exists — because they don’t see it
23470,"how is that systemic racism, can you help me understand?"
23471,but that racist guy is the teacher
23472,"but that's the thing right - if SGeans feel like they're ""above"" the FnB wage and industry, then KF's point is that these jobs should then be allowed to hire foreign workers since apparently the locals don't want it."
23473,but the point of this is to put underutilised vouchers to good use for migrant workers to see sights they can’t afford to visit.
23474,"but the real question, why do they have 3 domestic workers..."
23475,but there're already many french expats in SG ... i thought diversity would apply to rare african & south american countries..
23476,the fact it was open long before VTL doesnt mean it wasn't closed before.
23477,All the PRs and citizenships that our government handed out like toilet paper to CECA now suddenly comes in useful.
23478,"by being aware of unscrupulous agents charging FDW heavy fees for working in sg, the sg govt is complicit in their struggles."
23479,"by closing the borders to other countries, we can't do that because we are too reliant on foreign workers, and once everything goes outta hand, no amount of restrictions can stop the spread as shown by what Singapore has experienced for the past few months."
23480,can someone enlighten why that incident is racist?
23481,"all the ugly sides of Singapore now out in the open - racists, xenophobic people, etc."
23482,"but imagine trying to do something nice to celebrate diversity - religion, culture, color you name it - and got called out as racist for doing that."
23483,cultural insensitivity does not equate to racism.
23484,"racism :  prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized."
23485,can't wait for the xenophobic complaints here about how we're treating them too well  /s
23486,give fine amt to maid
23487,casual racism is the frog in the heated pot
23488,check with the singapore expat forums for more info.
23489,VTL=citizen/PR.
23490,LTP holders need a VTP to be able to use travel on the VTL.
23491,racism is racism.
23492,"come shan I teach you how to respond to controversial issues:  ""we condemn racism and harassment in all forms."
23493,comments here really proving the point of why race discussions on this sub have been very messy and not understanding how racism is not always overt.
23494,"even if you don't agree about this incident being racist, defending the PA here because they said 'sorry' is really not it."
23495,"incidents like this keep sliding, people keep saying it's not racism we're importing cultural wars, etc., it's just harmless funny caricatures, when it's being done by government bodies who should be the ones promoting cultural & racial sensitivity."
23496,"compared to our expats, these guys are treated like real prisoners.."
23497,"always love to have more people of different culture here in SG and positively contributing back to society and making SG and the world a better place  dont worry about the xenophobia thingy, it will happen and happens in any country anyway, this category of people will have to suck it up and learn to adapt as the world does not revolve around them  i hope you are having a role in the more happening companies since they will likely have a employee pot of mixed cultures and nationalities etc, more positivity and lesser of xenophobic stuff"
23498,"idk i would think the onus instead is on the racist to try to understand other races instead and not to go out and offend people because its the right thing to do, not because you may get caught if you do so?"
23499,cos it's way easier to paint yourself as the victim rather than a racist :)
23500,"or they lie = eg: promise no unpaid OT but in reality everyday OT   or maybe the office is unhealthy = rats, toxic black mold but they don't give a f (yes, i've seen this comment on glassdoor reviews)   or you find out you cannot take japanese corporate culture   or you find out company is run by a sexual predator      or you find out your company is racist as F          imagine the unfairness of a contract that forces you to give 2 month notice or pay in lieu to quit when you find out about these after 1 week on the job."
23501,"currently we still need foreign workers, house prices are still rising, productivity is still not rising, and still have domestic sentiments to deal with."
23502,"currently, if the maid doesnt go out in off day, the employer must pay 1 day salary to compensate it."
23503,"after the changes, the maid can take 1 day leave, and the employer would still need to pay her 1 day salary."
23504,"the existing office might be majorly foreign workers and misfits local culture, or skills mismatch among many other long term sociological factors"
23505,"singaporeans gotta be strong, give up 2 years of life for the country, complete studies late, then gotta excel in their field to outmatch the immigrants, also gotta fight the rich n hansum angmos stealin our gals, tuff life!"
23506,now i know why one of my classmates married an expat
23507,Which is why i'm expecting more bans to arrive for VTL.
23508,"decides to take lift built by migrant workers, proceeds to racially abuse them."
23509,Be more proactive in eliminating institutional racism.
23510,deh this is a racist term from the get go deh
23511,let the market decide which industries need foreign talent the most and what the price of that labour should be.
23512,have to see the video to know if its racist or bad parody.
23513,please ban them from ever hiring maids.
23514,I'm from the states and called everyone working here that wasn't singaporian an expat.
23515,pretty sure the racists are only targeting certain races
23516,"didnt mean it negatively, have had bad experiences with maids where they come in and dont do anything after one scolding session, they decide to leave... no one is denying their freedom or rights"
23517,though the maid should have just stop when the mother told her.
23518,disclaimer: incoming racist joke/stereotype/wev  *but aren't Malays good at multiplying?
23519,do maids have health and dental insurance too from their employers?
23520,"edit: I'm just going to hijack this with [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMWMuJFGL3A)  Tan Cheng Bock did literally say ""among the terms of ce[sic] or CECA, allow the free movement of professionals in 125 un 127 sectors to enter and work in Singapore"", emphasis mine."
23521,do you disagree that expats tend to spend more than locals?
23522,do you mind pointing out the racist and xenophobic comment?
23523,"but they do get more government funding.. minority students can enter these jcs with the assumption they clear higher mother tongue in secondary school or are willing to travel out of school for lessons, you can't think that isn't an obstacle."
23524,"i assume the maid take home pay is peanuts, i dun think the employer can afford them if they r paying a thriving wage."
23525,">   >For instance, from January 2024, the Dependency Ratio Ceiling - or the proportion of foreign workers a firm can employ - will be reduced from 87.5 per cent to 83.3 per cent."
23526,does this apply to foreign workers as well?
23527,domestic worker cum maid  chauffeur cum receptionist  IT guy cum chef
23528,don't lump racism and xenophobia together.
23529,the idea behind racism is that people should be treated differently based on their race.
23530,the idea behind xenophobia is that people should be treated differently based on their nationality.
23531,"don't think they are testing all 300k in 2 weeks, only testing all in that dormitory"
23532,"don't worry bro, there'll be plenty of local non-minorities who will speak up for you guys if that happens...think PSP should have gotten a minority member to deliver their message to avoid being construed as racist.."
23533,don’t forget the rampant xenophobia.
23534,don’t want to rent out to heavy cookers is being racist.
23535,"totally makes sense, spend tens of hours of your time to do that so that somebody on reddit can say you are now not a sexist, racist and discriminating bigot."
23536,And like you said the beauty in Singapore is its diversity of culture... We are all immigrants (other than the native Malays) so its a bit hypocritical for us to be xenophobic at the same time.
23537,Also at least in my experience new citizens or immigrants they are interested in assimilating and joining in our local holidays and stuff.
23538,"In this situation, ~I guess~ PA didn’t mean to hurt the Malay community but their lack of sensitivity from this hullaballoo was YES, ignorant but it was also racist."
23539,singapore has to have a restrictive immigration policy because of land size and infrastructure limitations.
23540,"as such, him being judged against based on his skin colour/race due to perceived norms about his culture, is definitely institutionalised racism"
23541,of course this was a circle of fairly well to do expat package people.
23542,e CECA r TAKING OVER.
23543,"earlier today, my friends and i were talking about how our indian friend only ‘looks at’ guys her race, and were joking that it’s racist (just for laughs, we weren’t being serious) - to which she said that she doesn’t really know why too, but she thinks it might be because she belongs to a minority race group, and so she pays more attention to the other minorities."
23544,i don’t wanna sound like some racist prick (i’m not) or start a war but just wanna hear you guys’ opinions on this!
23545,"easier to blame ""xenophobia"" than to address the root cause."
23546,edit2: after 7 agents we got our VTL flight back by making a complaint on their website.
23547,"Since it's now after the actual flight I can say that both the VTL and the domestic flight flew normally as scheduled, so I'm not sure why we where kicked off initially."
23548,Malaysia Airlines just send me a message that my VTL flight (to Singapore) has been cancelled.
23549,"I can't find any announcement about it anywhere, and this would be major change to the VTL policy."
23550,"there are legitimate concerns about the flooding of immigrants and them being fast tracked and all, but as long as you can socially integrate into SG i dont see the need to be angry/disapprove"
23551,can't exploit migrant workers if we don't have any migrant workers.
23552,"employers of work permit holders are required to be responsible for their medical expenses including pre existing conditions, it's why companies have to buy medical insurance with a minimum coverage set by the govt for these people"
23553,"the most i know of are maids being treated as half a family, which is very common."
23554,"plans about retirement, studies/job opportunities, marriage/family planning are never involved... pregnant maids are “always” send back, instead of being adopted as part of the family."
23555,Singapore in general has no issues with importing immigrants.
23556,You can read about the horror stories down in the singapore expat forums.
23557,"even if the expats bring the parents, i doubt they know any good place to rent... ;)"
23558,"it's racist (regardless, if it's done unconsciously), to not respect one's cultural event as valuable enough to be entitled a day of leave."
23559,"every time some uppity minority raises concerns of racism, it seems like it's *everybody fucking else* being the ones who get offended"
23560,"what we have instead are: expat bubbles - in banks, condos, etc  it is this same repeating strategy that has brought us into this vicious cycle."
23561,"everytime u see a tiktok video that featured singaporeans, the comments automatically flame them, ranging from casual racism ; calling malays “future ite students”, calling indians “apu nehneh”, calling chinese “covid or all karens are chinese” or “chao ang moh” whenever they see a white person to homophobia ; calling everyone “chao ah gua”"
23562,"I really wonder why we have to pass our mother tongue if it is totally inapplicable to our work life(generally), unless otherwise specified."
23563,you see caucasian countries like UK/US where the whites suddenly went xenophobic and assault/shout at anyone remotely looking like an asian (not even chinese) to 'go back to china'.
23564,This pandemic brings out the racist and xenophobic in those people.
23565,"the fact that people have the audacity to shoot down others feelings of racism, which is VERY apparent in this country is beyond disgusting"
23566,exactly why I said calling Indians hei ren in considered racist.
23567,"exactly, agents are greedy not racists."
23568,"exactly, left they say right they say everything also they say but then they want us all to be part of the effort and doing it all together yet when shit like this happens it's somehow the community's fault, we xenophobic and racist."
23569,"exactly, wouldn’t reserved presidency be racist then?"
23570,you probably said it much more eloquently than i.  too bad some people here are too caught up in the witch hunt to label the next singaporean as xenophobic.
23571,"expat aren’t the only ones affected, i am malaysian / SG PR (on the verge of receiving my SG citizen) and i haven’t seen my friends & family for 2 years."
23572,expat here as well.
23573,expat here too.
23574,"expat junior staff could be replaced by the many local tech trainees that SG has been producing over the past few years, no?"
23575,expat shield....
23576,"expat software engineer in singapore, here on a work visa, 8 years exp, $9k/mo"
23577,expat sole proprietors/autoentrepreneurs indirectly shunt away business from their local counterparts.
23578,"in a way, this may be good for locals doing similar businesses such as freelance writing, coaching/tutoring, selling crafts/foodstuff, working in retail etc...the irony, how expats have been painted by local media as casualties, while locals are depicted as lazy, entitled and inadequate."
23579,expat vision or Android box definitely sound like the best options..thanks to all that replied !
23580,"expatliving is just a online magazine targeting expats, everything on there is an advertisement."
23581,"expatriate noun ɪksˈpatrɪət,-ˈpeɪtrɪət,ɛks-/ 1. a person who lives outside their native country."
23582,"expats come here when there are jobs for them to do, and when there is a global recession and no jobs for them to do they leave."
23583,expecting to be downvoted here but - have y'all really not heard the other extreme aka really horrible maids who pull weird stunts?
23584,I'm just surprised at how like almost everyone seems to only have heard about maids being treated badly.
23585,face racism and get scarred for life ?
23586,Also you and your parents would have been tagged CECA and rapist for ever.
23587,"feel so disillusioned... we are living in a nation where migrant workers are treated like second class citizens, being locked up in their dorm despite being fully vaccinated, terrible living conditions despite what happened last year and being transported daily on unsafe trucks/lorries."
23588,"fellow chinese here, and i promise to speak out when i hear any racist remarks in real life"
23589,taichi govt responsibility on cimo  > The minister also noted that some people have criticised the Government for investigating those who respond to racist behaviour with racist remarks of their own.
23590,"He said: ""These sentiments are somewhat hypocritical... You don't respond to what you say is racism by your own racist remarks, by being racist yourself."
23591,"> He added that if the Government lets it slide when an Indian or Malay person responds to racism by a Chinese person with racist remarks of their own, then the next time the tables are turned, the Government may find itself constrained when it wants to take action."
23592,what happen when pap supporters make racist remarks.
23593,"didnt pap itself ""let it slide"" when the jurong mp made racist remarks."
23594,when pap mp made racist remarks in parliament.
23595,"> Some commentators have suggested that racist language, when employed as satire by minority races to call out the the majority race, should not be treated as racism."
23596,supporters like calvin cheng xixue jason neo all made outright racist remarks and got away with it.
23597,Seeing the govt go out of their way to defend CECA or foreigners will make people like CECA or foreigners LESS.
23598,"thirdly, some of us are racists but some of us aren't."
23599,"there are alot of monetary and non monetary taxes that locals are subject to and in wage discussions in any configuration ie local vs incoming migrant worker or local going abroad, the full sum of cpf is considered as part of your entire package and especially from a management budgetary sense where we include the actual total cost to the business ie benefits, insurance...etc so theres a saying that its pretty much always great for locals to get an expat package abroad."
23600,"for every one of this boss, there are 99 other SME boss born with a silver spoon and treating migrant workers like dirt"
23601,"for starters, by not being a xenophobic asshole"
23602,for the sake of clarity saying FDW (foreign domestic worker) is alright since that is their official job title.
23603,"of course they are people too & being a FDW isnt their sole identity, but the term FDW isnt dehumanising since they are literally domestic workers (as they work in homes) who are foreigners."
23604,it’s much better than saying “maid” or “servant”.
23605,"if people used the term “helper”, “person” or “aunty” the group of ppl theyre talking about would be less specific than FDW so there might be miscomm!"
23606,so yea FDW is about the most clear term someone can use to talk about FDWs without there being any miscomm & to be non-derogatory.
23607,forgot to put ‘ex-racist’ on his profile as well to show his remorse /s
23608,it is a form stereotyping as a result of ignorance which *does* mean that it’s racist.
23609,friends a mixed malay/chinese and constantly gets treated like the family maid by strangers
23610,"from my own experience as a chinese, i have seen countless amount of racist remarks made to colored people, especially to the blacks and indians, which i find is fucked up."
23611,"However, unlike many people i know, i have come to sympathise with people who get racist remarks and learned that indians, malays etc are just like us."
23612,from racist people like her.
23613,dennis chew did that in poor taste and bordering on racist shit and so did preeti.
23614,why is the maid made to wash an elderly man anyway?
23615,"funny comment from that thread  /quote   "" expats who have long seen a stint in Asia as an   important and lucrative experience."""
23616,give singaporeans min wage or the expats can go home
23617,a lot of the problems with maids being treated this way are legacy issues.
23618,OK fine.. yes it's temporary and yes it's to make sure they allow in immigrants who has no ill intentions.
23619,"however, again, I'm not arguing if this was racist or not, and therefore whether we shd listen to the 1000 redditors or dr/wise man."
23620,"note: point 1, 3 and 4 were meant to be in response to other redditors' view of the situation, and offering alternative perspectives to how we define racism."
23621,they weren't meant to accuse pa's actions as being racist.
23622,"die lah everyone will leave immediately, we will go back to a fishing village, barisan sosialis will take power and we will have to go and work as maid in other country!"
23623,"goes on about BLM, but when govt proposes to build foreign worker dorms near residential areas, all go crazy protesting."
23624,going to be race to see if me and my family can get to the states and back over the holidays before VTLs are shutdown.
23625,so all the racism dies.
23626,"good god, I'm ashamed that there're so many similar cases of abuse in Singapore..isn't there some hotline the poor maids can call if they need help?"
23627,good job bro people talking about racism and you go on a rant about feminism... we can truly see you understand neither of those things
23628,then u will know if the problem is ex colleagues or u.   but of course you will face racism at workplace.
23629,its whether the colleagues are nice but make ignorant comments that are racist.
23630,or u can kena racist boss who will make life tough by arrowing u for the most useless tasks.
23631,"let me remind you that less than a century ago experts were saying homosexuality was a mental disorder, and experts used science to justify racism."
23632,"grow up, do your own chores and stop whinging about how the domestic helper is 'lazing around'."
23633,"guys, the main point here isn't whether it's actually racist or not to say malay wedding = hari raya (and whether the word is being cheapened by overuse)."
23634,"I tell them I'm not comfortable with them saying that, bc I think it's racist and they're looking down on my race."
23635,"if they listen seriously to my comment and make an effort to make me feel heard, and then change their behaviour to be more sensitive in the future, then it doesn't matter if their original comment was racist or just plain ignorance - they've listened and changed."
23636,"if they just said ""lol don't b a snowflake"" instead, then that would be pretty racist, and also u can't claim ignorance and lack of intent the next time."
23637,"like others have mentioned, there's socioeconomic factors playing into how acceptable racism can be to different members of the minority, and how much racism is experienced."
23638,"so just because one malay dude says ""it's not racist!!!"""
23639,"edit: point 1, 3 and 4 were meant to be in response to other redditors' view of the situation, and offering alternative perspectives to how we define racism."
23640,they weren't meant to accuse pa's actions as being racist.
23641,my main point is to express unhappiness with the lack of professionalism and condescending attitude with which amrin amin responded to the accusations of racism.
23642,no need rollout VTL if they wanna achieve same purpose!
23643,not only is it sad to have to endure that kind of racism but also the elitism that ite is of somewhat lower value.
23644,"haha now I am curious, what other activities make up an expat lifestyle?"
23645,"What you should be asking is, "" What is the ethical reprecussions for maintaining an enforced quarrantine on the migrant worker population."""
23646,haha pretending you care about the plight of foreign workers.
23647,haha yeah though I can't say I've actually faced direct racism here but that might just be because I don't interact with people much.
23648,"haha...overseas sinkies are not expats la...u tell that to the natives over there, they'll laugh at u.."
23649,asking for english proficiency is now xenophobic.
23650,hahaha doubt he would put “vocal and illogical racist” on his resume
23651,he probably meant the rule of prohibiting 2nd class citizens like us sinkies confronting 1st class foreign talent.
23652,"2 mths ago i dropped him a pm, drawing his attention to the ‘foreign worker situation’, and introducing ‘itsrainingraincoats’ to him hoping he’d make use of his fame to share it."
23653,"he said he got his VTP, so VTL"
23654,"he says singaporeans are the most xenophobic people he’s ever met, not the most xenophobic people in the world."
23655,imagine me going to Malaysia and complaining that they are racism to their own malaysia.
23656,"I moved from malaysia i was 10, im serving NS in 6 months and because i speak with a slightly different accent, i have more than a dozen teachers asking if im from china since primary 5  i can't even fathom how bad it must be for non chinese   people do be racist"
23657,"""rampant"" and ""explicit""    are not the two words I would use to describe the racism in SG"
23658,then we introduce a COE system for those who want to hire foreign workers and let the market work itself out.
23659,"overseas is damn dangerous compared to singapore, there are gangs of losers in cars who will drive by and shout some racist shit at you, and blaring their horn."
23660,You can also look at the various (geographical) scales that you can see conflict between foreign talent and foreign workers eg.
23661,Alternatively you can choose to focus on a certain group of foreign workers and the challenges they face in different spaces.
23662,"foreign construction workers, foreign domestic workers) that I've come across in my studies on this topic (although most of them did arise from gender-based readings, but I'm sure you can reframe the examples in these readings to help you formulate arguments)."
23663,IIRC Huang has done a few reports on FDWs.
23664,i hope everyone in singapore who was previously racist will one day also be inspired to change and be more accepting
23665,"of course, his story could be bullshit, he deserves to pay his fine cos it's his mistake, etc etc etc... 4.5k is a lot of money for anybody let alone a foreign worker."
23666,"Yet we see PAP quoting restrictions till 2022/2024 (just before elections in 2025), I do feel like the world would have left us behind by then, expats would have left, Singaporeans that were really *frustrated* might even find opportunity to leave."
23667,"hi throwaway account, there is no racism, only his imagination at work."
23668,"hi, there’s an organization [It’s Raining Raincoats](https://instagram.com/itsrainingraincoats?igshid=b3njqsum452v) that provides support for the migrant workers."
23669,[This link ](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-v2lFnnjsO/?igshid=1w5gv4quanx2v) consists of the phone numbers to some of the volunteers there for the migrant workers to contact when they require help.
23670,Please do not hesitate to share this if you know of any migrant workers that needs help!
23671,cause' racism.
23672,the accounts here that always rail against them in the sub either via tribalism or racism is foolish
23673,"hire more than 1 la lol, my friend hse 3 story have 3 maid liao"
23674,"Suddenly, everybody is so knowledgeable about racism and police brutality in America."
23675,is it right for him to do so or is he racist?
23676,holy fuck when I went to Maldives the non-VTL return flight was like $400 cheaper
23677,honest question: is it racist if i do not want to date a muslim due to dietary restrictions?
23678,"honestly in my experience the elderly tend to be massive cunts, being incredibly entitled and racist."
23679,what about japan's longstanding issues with its immigrants?
23680,i have had friends who were mistreating their maids thru verbal abuse (no physical abuse).
23681,"i also had a neighbour that verbally abused her maids, 2 of them ran away (different maids at different times) and another had to be sent back because she was inconsolable."
23682,how about pity the mixed students who suck at mother tongue but is forced to take MTL as a subject.

23687,how is others are racist also a valid answer ?
23688,how is the statement ‘descendants of prisoners’ racist?
23689,how is this comment not just blatant racism
23690,how is this racist?
23691,how to check if a flight is a designated VTL flight?
23692,Are all flights from the VTL country into SG automatically a VTL flight?
23693,how to report racism in Singapore?
23694,how to show people you are racist without showing people you are racist
23695,The biggest is the removal of VTL altogether!!
23696,"&#x200B;  >Instead of VTLs with selected countries, Singapore should transition towards opening up for all vaccinated travellers, he added."
23697,"Instead of an abrupt change, Singapore will take the first step now by simplifying the current border restrictions for non-VTL travellers."
23698,">   >The second is a General Travel category consisting of countries that Singapore has started VTLs for, together with non-VTL countries and regions."
23699,"VTL travellers from countries in this category can enjoy quarantine-free travel, while those from non-VTL countries have to undergo a 7-day Stay-Home Notice."

23702,"http://m.smh.com.au/national/racism-on-the-rise-in-australia-migrants-report-cultural-shift-20140405-365a5.html  Yup, Australia is less racist than Singapore."

23704,"http://twc2.org.sg/getinvolved/volunteer/ This organisation (transient workers count too) seems to do a lot for migrant workers, and they have loads of volunteer roles available, for people who wanna volunteer in person or over zoom."
23705,And you wonder why people think that Australia is a racist country.
23706,Then I realise that's roughly how much maids are being paid.
23707,"Every one of you with a maid, do you bother paying your maid a living wage?"
23708,http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-plans-to-stop-sending-new-live-in-maids-abroad  The Indonesian government has threatened to ban maids to Singapore before and demanded compulsory off days for maids and as well as banning the practice of live-in maids and demanded accommodation to be built for maids.
23709,I think a big problem here is that many of the maids still want to come here even though they know it sucks here.
23710,"Hell, I'm sure I have done it before for less than what maids get paid today."

23719,"money like this is chump change to most ppl that can afford a maid, and I know there are those that are on a tight budget that only can afford a maid to take care of elderly parents or young children or themselves but."
23720,to sacrifice a maids autonomy over her own passport for just a hundred plus dollars?
23721,like if individuals cant afford a maid I'm sure there are more affordable ways and efforts ppl can make to better their situation.
23722,maids are human beings not a object the boss own (that some get away with treating them however too cruelly they want to be used.)
23723,the fear of the maid leaving with stolen things  before the contract end also cant she steal after the contract ends too?
23724,"like i understand a maid could have bad intentions to just come, steal and leave but the maid should be blacklisted and have legal ramifications when they go back to their country."
23725,do u know the notice period for a maid to quit?
23726,isnt that good enough then the maid also i find should then be responsible  paying and applying for her own passport.
23727,"basically all im saying is a maid should be treated just like how u would treat a singaporean worker in a company here , or a foreign worker in a  company here."

23746,"I feel like we have a generational problem on our hands -- yes, abusing maids seems to be a thing people learn from their parents as disgusting as it is and they pass it on to their kids."

23763,owners also left a dog with maid and didnt check on it using webcam or skype with the maid or something.
23764,they cant sense if the maid likes the dog and will treat it well?
23765,i FORESEE MORE Idiotic people treating their maids MORE LIKE SHIT due to increased prices .
23766,Pour boiling water on those employees who do the same to the maid please...
23767,i really hope that schools would actually start teaching students about underlying bias and rooted internalised racism instead of just going on about how 'peaceful' a society singapore is.
23768,there should be no racism at all period.
23769,just have to put up a disclaimer here quick: op (and any others on this thread) opening up about experiences with racism is NOT CAUSING RACIAL DISCORD.
23770,"we're just asking, begging, pleading with you all to realise that this 'casual racism' has nothing casual about it."
23771,i actually wouldn’t mind a system where they will do regular checks to see if the maid and the family is doing well with each other.
23772,Not just for the maid but for the family as well.
23773,payment wise... split half with maid and family?
23774,i agree that’s racist.
23775,"i agree with you, though i feel that still does not make the act racist, since there’s no clear prejudice."
23776,"The woman was also a bit much, throwing the word ‘racist’ around unnecessarily, when this incident pales in comparison to the actually racist acts that have been in the news recently."
23777,disclaimer: am a minority muslim but not malay so i may not get it if it’s racist or not.
23778,"That must mean systemic racism doesn’t exist, nice argument u have there chief"
23779,"if anyone has any expat friends, you can check their expenditure and you will realise that alot of their expenditure leak overseas (i.e."
23780,These countries have enough land mass such that all the racists and nationalists can all flock together in their own territory.
23781,"If I am a racist in Singapore, it isn't very practical to find a place to hide such that I dont have to see a particular race."
23782,"If you look like a migrant worker you will just be discriminated against, no question."
23783,my relative had to fire their maid after they realised the maid actually sneaks out at night to meet someone.
23784,tldr: there are shit families but there are also shit maids.
23785,i cant believe the level of racism i am reading in OPs post!!!
23786,your examples above are absolutely classic case of racism and i agree.
23787,"just as how governments identifies potential immigrants by race, occupation, nationality and religion, it is a valid proxy."
23788,is this then racist?
23789,i do not see any problems with having a close relationship with a maid/helper.
23790,i don't get the idea of a maid it seems like modern day slavery to me
23791,"you are saying that the influx of foreign workers is just exposing singaporean labour to the free market; therefore, it can't be helped if the market values a singaporean cleaner's labour as below subsistence wages, because the reality is that the singaporean cleaner's labour isn't worth much."
23792,"knowing reddit, any rationalism probably died after  >I'm an expat here"
23793,i don't think racist is the right term to use.
23794,racism implies extreme hatred towards another race.
23795,i don't think people are born racist.
23796,we don't hire foreign labor other than maids.
23797,"For maids, it is highly regulated."
23798,Just try ill treating your maid and the force of the law and regulations will fall hard on you.
23799,"first there's childcare, then maids."
23800,"i get that hiring maids or letting grandparents take care of the kid are the only options working parents have, but that bring the question: why have children?"
23801,but unfortunately this thinking is regarded as racist in a lot of replies below.
23802,"i think if you put your mind to it (and if you're being paid to do so), you can still pick up your mother tongue."
23803,hiring an foreign talent vs hiring a local.
23804,"in a way, wages in Singapore is depressed due to the willingness of foreign talent to take on a lower pay (as compared to local)."
23805,"companies can/may/will review their staff cost and hopefully find it more cost effective to hire local, at higher wages, and still may/can/will find it less costly than hiring an foreign talent."
23806,"in the event of status quo, companies can continue to depress/under pay local, because foreign talent are most cost effective than local (of course, there are exception to this general statement)."
23807,"i guess sg isn’t as great as we all thought, let’s go somewhere else where expats have better outlook"
23808,"i guess she should go back to malaysia, confirm there won't have chinese privilege or chinese racism to minorities and will be difficult for chinese too."
23809,i had a helper-maid that channeled the supernatural before.
23810,i have a colleague who complained that she has a maid who quit on her because my colleague doesnt allow her maid to use mobile phone during working hours.
23811,and boasting how good of employer she is by allowing her maid to use mobile phone at night and other chip in saying that their maids are not even allowed to use mobile phones at all.
23812,Also ive never said no to any maid when they ask me for the wifi password.
23813,i have seen people on facebook claim that our HDB flats will cost 2x just because we give our foreign workers better living conditions
23814,Could it be the merdeka gen is racist af ?
23815,"i thought i'd host an AMA to see if there are any interest in knowing how a chinese singaporean conscripted into the singapore police forces deals with racism in the police force, and how i went in with no bias against malays but ORD-ed with a more intimate understanding of the discrimination against them based on personal experience and observation."
23816,I am someone who really cares about mental well-being and yet somehow never really gave a thought about the mental health of the dormitory workers.
23817,i mean most singaporeans cant afford maid even now.
23818,"the country just made it ""affordable"" by ignoring some basic human rights by making these maids sleep in store rooms or share room with elderly etc."
23819,"i mean yeah duh it just means at a certain point people with racist disposition also happen to be right, (we should close border earlier or lengthen SHN) like broken clock is right once a day"
23820,"i mean, the government is spending a large bulk of the money expanding the healthcare infrastructure and taking care of the foreign workers, like they should be."
23821,i mean...you had singaporean chinese shouting at china chinese to 'go back' so 'same ethnicity racism' works and is apparently a thing.
23822,"i prefer to think that people are idealistic rather than ""accepting a basic fact of life"" (brings in suffrage, black rights in america yadayada)  i just dislike how the ""enlightened"" go around insulting the people they want to persuade, great job there man (you're racist/ignorant/bigot/sexist pls change)"
23823,we went on an excursion and to no surprise she treated the maid badly scolding her for the food for the way she cleaned with a tiny cluttered room to sleep in.
23824,she seemed to treat the children nicely but also with discipline but not as badly as the maid.
23825,i still remember when idiots on facebook went around saying they were probably secretly meeting up with their maid girlfriends who would spread it to us.
23826,"For example, after the massive backlash in 2011, where the incumbent suffered the loss of their first GRC, immigration policy was tightened significantly in the immediate aftermath."
23827,"i take that back, expats are welcome as long they dont increase gst."
23828,"i think CECA provides us with access to educated labor (healthcare, STEM, IT, finance professionals)."
23829,"from the migrant worker incident, i’m sure we all know how to not take any things for granted."
23830,"i think it's how some people feel empowered knowing they can treat maids like that, power corrupts and corruption empowers"
23831,Angmoh expat families here who hire helpers treat their helpers very well.
23832,"You won’t believe how many families bring their maids to look after the young kids, but the maids are not entitled to the buffet (family doesn’t want to pay the expensive price for the maid for the buffet) , they bring and eat their own bread/cup noodles instead."
23833,to compare power dynamics in a FDW-employer relationship.
23834,i think that the report could be skewed by the expat female-male ratios.
23835,"most of the expats are male who are executive levels, which drags the male payscale up."
23836,"i think there's ambiguity around what an ""expat package"" is."
23837,"non SG passport)   2. temporary additional allowance on top of an employees home office compensation package (not to be confused with expenses/per diem allowances for adhoc business trips)   3. company perks for senior employees    i think what people are discussing here in this thread is (1); whereas most HR would consider an expat package as (2), where concepts like tax equalization apply."
23838,"expat package, so lucrative."
23839,"but don’t go charging in every issue calling people racists, when some are but others may not be."
23840,"if it is the ONLY deciding factor, then yes it is racist."
23841,"to provide some solution instead of ranting, what should really be done is to have RIGHTS TO RENT legislation, addressing race, gender and other forms of discrimination, not go on charging at landlords calling them a racist while operating on other discriminatory factors."
23842,i was sexually abused by my domestic helper as a child.
23843,"what i’m suggesting here is simply for those that are racist to be less racist, if you are not racist at all then this message isn’t meant for you"
23844,i wasn't referring to the article but just making a general comment on the topic of racism.
23845,The main reason is because of the immigrant mentality.
23846,"i went into the exact wording and explained why your statement is saying that only bosses abuse maids  nobody is accusing you of saying that people who abuse cannot be non-bosses; it's not accusatory, because you ARE saying that  the exact English used in your original statement is the issue, which i tried to explain in my first reply"
23847,i would say they are both xenophobic and racist.
23848,there are very many people in this country that are racist towards singaporean indians.
23849,and then obviously there are those who are clearly xenophobic.
23850,i wouldn't expect anything less from a racist.
23851,and landlords don’t provide shelter equally to all race or religion not because all of them are racist but because it’s a risk/reward balance.
23852,"malay here and i definitely agree with what you said about how there are racists in every race but ultimately because systemic racism exists, the minorities experience it a lot more/often like being denied jobs or housing."
23853,from the majority race speaking up or amplifying minorities' voices when we speak up about racism.
23854,i'm always sharing posts on ig about racism and the experiences of minorities here yet they seem not to care.
23855,that being said i'm always unlearning any racist or any -ist ideologies that i had growing up and i hope that everyone else can too.
23856,"it can be difficult pill to swallow when admitting that you *may* be racist but you suffer no loss from doing so, instead you're contributing to the growth of a better society :)   oops this was a long one sorry!"
23857,"this applies to racism against Singaporean M/I/O minorities, but also to seemingly Western movements like BLM."
23858,for racism in different countries is not mutually exclusive.
23859,"you may be a privileged race in one country, but like it or not, as long as you are a POC you WILL be a minority that will face racism in another."
23860,we as POCs are all battling a common enemy - structural racism.
23861,let me give some sources which i personally felt were informative and helped me to understand structural racism and its perpetuation in the US.
23862,all in all i agree wholeheartedly that if we post stuff about BLM but turn our backs on the foreign worker situation or use racist slurs and stereotypes to make minorities uncomfortable then that's a piece of shit thing to do.
23863,"It's 2020, do people still find these racist ""jokes"" like the malay vs bench one (amongst many others) funny?"
23864,"I don't think that the ""migrant worker"" label has anything to do with this."
23865,ielts is easier than o levels English.
23866,if anything it shows how ridiculous our policies are that he had to wait 22 months and on top of that still take a VTL flight.
23867,if anything this reveals more about her personality than the maid’s.
23868,"if you lose him, it's still worth the chance you change the environment his child will observe, as well as the maid's life"
23869,doesnt change the fact that the maid should be responsible for the service and miscellaneous fee the employer had to pay because of a unilateral contract void just like any other contract.
23870,"if it's isolated case, then can say is crazy maid."
23871,"ppl with maids, ensure that your maids have adequate rests everyday."
23872,it is high time various things need to change with regards to domestic helpers in singapore.
23873,"if i’m ever gonna get a maid, it’s really just to handle my daily tasks like cleanup and laundry."
23874,Probably wouldn’t expect the maid to cook.
23875,if only this was the way to solve racism
23876,"if the low IQ drug guy is getting the death penalty, shouldn't the maid also be sentenced to death?"
23877,"if the maid was somehow involved in allowing the interview, GG... TOCA might have just caused the maid to lose her job.."
23878,"if they are work permit holder still need VTP... the ease of VTP for long term pass holders are only for SP, EP isn't it"
23879,if they aren't immigrants they are just 'foreign workers' no different from Banglas working in singapore but just more educated and in a different industry
23880,"if this guy is already so racist when he is a minority, can you imagine how much more racist he would be if he was in the majority or even plurality."
23881,"if treatment for singaporeans is covered by the govt, why should treatment for foreign workers who live in singapore not be?"
23882,if we set up an auction system for immigration foreign workers will be able to bid to bring over as many of their family members as they want or are willing to pay for.
23883,"if you really think about it racism is kinda use so much in a sense it is convoluted and thus yea it can mean they are racist  also your solution is a bit flawed cause your solution is racist itself, the first one."
23884,the rising covid rate for foreign workers in their dorms here didnt move you to use your influence to get your followers to donate or volunteer for them??
23885,"if “fucking china always like this send all of them back home” isn’t even a little xenophobic, nothing is really"
23886,"i know the racism here isn't as bad as it is in other countries, but it just sucks here that BECAUSE it's a bit less intense, our experiences get invalidated."
23887,"recently, at work, a rather casual racist remark was passed around and i got so upset i pondered over it and raised it up to HR after 2 weeks."
23888,im not racist but..
23889,im so sorry man...  i relate too as a indian immigrant who have been here pretty much my whole life :c
23890,imagine being so biased thinking racism and political leaning is linked
23891,10x trolling spf  10x praising spf  10x racist statements  10x wayang COI  10x draconian new laws  10x minister speculating without proof while telling people to not speculate  etc  etc
23892,"imagine you're a foreign worker task to refurbished for another worker, and return to your own dorm with terrible conditions"
23893,"For me, if it's in a group setting I'll just tell them it's racist."
23894,"we can have the conversation about discrimination in singapore in the same wavelength as racism in america, they arent exclusive."
23895,implying if u cant stand the maid its ok to abuse?
23896,why should who the maid is have anything to do with the abuse in the 1st place???
23897,in before xenophobic / racist hoo hah....  oh wait.....  crickets.........
23898,"Heck, some of the ""foreign talents"" you despise so much have been in the same title for over a decade and yet still enjoys the job(or should we say, torture?)"
23899,"in my condo, so many expats have left."
23900,in Singapore they rescue maids.
23901,"in this particular instance, \*indians\* in \*singapore\* are still facing racism."
23902,inb4 video/photo from SJW about foreign workers spotting outside
23903,including the tests was the non-VTL flight cheaper?
23904,but racist?
23905,I mean if we're talking silicon valley or global cities like new york and london then yeah the expats there are probably the best of the best.
23906,it stands to reason that the average expat (not the top people of course) are not in that tier.
23907,is calling someone white racist too?
23908,is he an expat when he’s already a pr?
23909,is jail gonna change any racists mind ?
23910,"isnt it (officially at least) ""racism to prevent racism"""
23911,isnt that just racism
23912,"isnt the fact that u think calling black is demeaning, is in itself racist?"
23913,isnt the whole point of expats constantly packing and moving at the whim of the business.
23914,"theyre not privileged faux immigrants, just professionals without roots."
23915,it also subsists on a diet of exploitated and abused poor foreign workers who arent even allowed the dignity of having a safe ride on the streets that they build
23916,"the state of migrant worker welfare @ the moment is dismal, but I'm not seeing anyone who *does* have in-depth knowledge of the industry saying ""yes, all the $$ is really going to senior management at the expense of those on the ground""."
23917,Is it like some expat magnet or something?
23918,"Racial separatism is the belief, most of the time based on racism, that different races should remain segregated and apart from one another."
23919,https://www.adl.org/racism
23920,it is by definition discriminatory but is it racist?
23921,"and is the policy of shaving everyone, even Sikhs, made less racist by the fact that it is not discriminatory?"
23922,"it is not about the banner , some people on facebook made specific racist comments under the picture of the Indian family"
23923,"it is racist, (maybe not just race, could be anti-local singaporeans) but it is also the flats owners preference on his tenants... its not a mutually exclusive thing."
23924,"Both, for the most part, stem from racism"
23925,are you legit considering barring your maid from going out on off days?
23926,it's anti-intellectualism at its finest to blame racist actions of individuals on critical race theory.
23927,"it's so incredibly degrading for the ostensibly Chinese writer of this horseshit to blame racism on minorities adopting ""Western cultural markers"" or whatever instead of, I don't know, the racists?"
23928,it's like an incentive to be kind to the maids
23929,"The ""racism"" is not the intended effect, say if it was a PRC or a Bangladeshi worker - the same ""this is not China/ India"" applies."
23930,"The way I see it, it's less racism and more of a response of the uncouth behavior, and therefore perfectly understandable at least to me and OP need not have stepped in (not that it's wrong)."
23931,"it's not even racist anymore it just wanton callousness and disregard for the well-being of a fellow human who IS A PART OF your family, albeit extended."
23932,"as long as you agree with your FDW that sundays are off until they repay their loan, it is ok. again, it has to be agreed up front."
23933,most FDWs take loans to come to Singapore to work.
23934,The FDW then slowly repays this loan until it is repaid and then they have their normal salary.
23935,this 2k is the loan that the FDW took to come to Singapore.
23936,"However, in this particular situation, it is tricky as to how this will ever be paid since it doesn't seem the FDW can or is willing to pay it off."
23937,linked to the second point is why most FDW do not have sundays off during the first few months.
23938,it's not racist.
23939,"it's sad, I was speaking to an ex-colleague some time ago when he was hiring a maid to help take care of his newborn."
23940,"Take a gander at the motherhood/kiasuparent forums, specifically the threads on maids, people are crazy."
23941,casual racism is still racism.
23942,racism is bad.
23943,"its a double edged sword, i have alot of local friends and colleagues including myself in the past, here who leave to places like london, frankfurt, hong kong, shanghai and new york on expat packages who go to their backyards and take their jobs with housing, expenses, schools....etc the works paid for."
23944,but there definitely needs better controls and thoughts  about expat enclaving problem.
23945,"i'm speaking from my personal experience, as i've been subjected to these insults countless times:  ""thanks for helping us, maid""  ""go to lucky plaza where you pinoys belong""  i'm sorry if i'm being too sensitive, but it's honestly fucking hurtful to be insulted all because of your nationality, and being called ""weak"" and ""can't take a joke"" when you try to make them stop."
23946,in addition seeing a national ad where a guy brownfaces is just a blatant reminder of all the OTHER racist crap we have to experience.
23947,its not racist if you ban flights cos of high covid cases.
23948,but a lot of racists are jumping on the ban flight bandwagon using covid as a cover.
23949,you cant claim to not be racist just by saying 'what if virus now takes longer than 14 days to appear'
23950,"obviously not saying racism isnt real for minorities here, but from the comments here, obviously a lot of people here just want something to blame for their life, what better place than anonymous reddit."
23951,"there's so many local indians having great jobs in doctor, lawyer, bankers very well represented for their race and yet some here blame racism for them not getting the job."
23952,"for all the talk of racsim, some of the comments here are just racist themselves, racism against chinese ain't racism because they are majority."
23953,"to the entitled guys here, being racist towards other race here is justified as long as I'm minority."
23954,i would legit pay legit money to see you explain to actual companies who would throw stones at you just for limiting foreign workers.
23955,"you pretend you know it all, you dont you're just a pathetic racist piece of human garbage thinking you know it all and that you're better than everyone else and thinking you're somehow heroic for supposedly starting some sort of movement when all youre doing is actually hurting real ""singapore"" firms, not even local firms, all firms based in singapore with singaporeans employed, who needs foreign workers."
23956,it’s (not) amazing how you just shrugged off racism
23957,it’s always the people dealing with foreign workers that display such disgusting behaviours.
23958,So many instances of employers taking advantage of the less educated foreign workers have surfaced and it’s always saddening to read.
23959,"PA talking defensively and the woman just ~~screaming ‘racism’~~ implying racism when it’s not a racist act, but merely a breach of privacy (no permission asked) and an act of ignorance (no checks done whether the image was suitable)."
23960,"it’s like the Aus-SG VTL man…Singapore passport can’t bring covid into Australia, but other passport in SG for 2 years still can bring covid into Australia"
23961,it’s sad that he’s been making racist and islamophobic remarks in school and yet no action was taken against him but only when this incident went viral then did the poly take it seriously.
23962,ive dontated to the migrant workers funds twice.
23963,"i’m all for opening up the economy but can someone pls explain why are we opening up more VTLs especially to high risk countries, when we still have to adhere to strict SMM rules and cannot even gather in groups of more than 2?"
23964,appreciate your mother tongue.
23965,but OP is talking about xenophobia and not racism among singaporeans lol
23966,"i’m guessing (i may be wrong) that yeah, expat population firstly."
23967,"got those who say racism doesn’t exist, i’m a living example"
23968,i’m sure there’s a way if not anybody can just accuse others for racism
23969,jeez the bar to call yourself an expat is so low these days.
23970,"jobs for expats, ns for singaporeans?"
23971,join some of the FDW fb groups and see how the maids flaunt their pay & privileges to each other.
23972,With little work experience you end up in junior positions with low salary and as expat expensive rent.
23973,"just a year back, any comment even vaguely 'conservative' or representing a 'majority' pov would have been downvoted to oblivion, maybe it's true, continuously calling the majority racist or privileged eventually backfires"
23974,just because 1 singaporean is racist doesn't mean all are racist.
23975,"just curious, migrant workers means all work pass holders (EP/S-Pass/Work Permits) or just foreign workers and fdws?"
23976,just last year got his colleague making racist comments.
23977,his party fanpage also kena reported for racist remarks.
23978,woman kena racist attack.
23979,i'm not sure to what extent this is the case for the low income foreign workers.
23980,What VTL only and cat2 countries have higher risk profiles??
23981,VTLs fly from cat2 countries?
23982,"just to add,if he hired a maid or cleaner for his son,all this would not have happened."
23983,And those are likely to be the key entry points for VTL too.
23984,iirc that's only provided to foreign workers facing the death penalty.
23985,"also can point to usa, malaysia and oz as racists."
23986,but cannot see or acknowledge local racism.
23987,You just have that overwhelming nationalism so when you read a comment about migrant workers in Singapore it awakened your need to talk about how the US is doing so much better (it isn't).
23988,"landlords....not just enough for them to be annoying, but they also somehow need to be racist"
23989,"last time was employer fire maid, now maid fire employer"
23990,leading to white people needing to apologize for their whiteness because whiteness is inherently racist and oppressive.
23991,which is as racist as can be.
23992,"2nd, you want to 'improve working conditions' for migrant workers."
23993,"Notwithstanding the fact that many Singaporeans are still having cost of living struggles, your migrant worker might just prefer that extra $ in cash than paying for standards set by someone else."
23994,let's be honest y'all we are all racists at heart we just don't say it out loud
23995,I already invited him to point out one example of racism in my posts.
23996,"you are confusing man, if there is racism, go ahead point out where it is."
23997,are you another woke neverbe but wannabe by condemning racism that dont exist?
23998,"lived in Australia (Melbourne) for 3 years, never experienced racism there, in Singapore on the other hand....  (btws I'm brown)"
23999,"lmao I think the 3rd guy from the top is being satirical, the 2nd and 4th ones are the real racist assholes here"
24000,and now you're equating the condemnation of racism to racism itself?
24001,"lmao maybe instead of focusing on opening VTLs, maybe focus that energy on working towards relaxing local restrictions instead?"
24002,no wonder my family maid is malay rolf /s
24003,lmao then well yeah.. i always hear a bunch of xenophobic shit being said.
24004,"local schs encourage competition, while intl schs encourage collaboration...this leads to the infamous 'sinkie pwn sinkie' culture, where locals deliberately screw over fellow locals & groom foreign talent for roles that locals could have easily done."
24005,"stop parroting the tired old ""expat = entitled"" bullshit and actually engage your brain mate."
24006,lol I don't get how there's so much coverage and outrage over Dubai and Qatars treatment of foreign workers when it's pretty much the exact same here in Singapore.
24007,Not that I think it's racism though; differences are always more salient than similarities.
24008,lol overwhelming sense of xenophobia.
24009,tfw demanding for correction of abuses of laws allowing foreign workers coming in = overwhelming xenophobia   HOW DARE YOU APPLY THE LAWS PROPERLY AND FAIRLY TO US.
24010,why is the intro on xenophobia instead?
24011,"There is the middle bloat of students who go to adulthood and get stuck in low pay, no career prospects, unable to find their niche, threatened by foreign talent."
24012,Singapore is literally built on the backs of foreign talent.
24013,"At the tall end of town, there are 150K expats that contribute roughly 32% of all income tax revenue."
24014,"in reality the mindset is still very racist but because no one says it in public, people act as if it doesn’t exist and do nothing to fix it."
24015,sgeans also very racist to black people and xenophobic to bangladeshis & china foreign workers.
24016,lol you're not an expat
24017,"Every single foreign worker is overworked, there is no such thing as 'taking an additional shift to cover the missing employee'"
24018,"look at the average expat (not the type that rent landed property and live in sentosa cove), I'm talking about the average expat."
24019,looking at all the replies here pushing for the continuation of domestic helper slavery...it's no wonder SG is still stuck in 3rd world country thinking..all wanting to profit from the exploitation of others..
24020,but rlly racism shldnt be tolerated anywhere
24021,"looks like there are 71 google reviews, all one star and mentioned the maid"
24022,maid owners?
24023,as in they “own” maids?
24024,"maids are at home mostly, with their abusers, and the less-educated ones really have very little enforced contact with the outside world."
24025,"this really needs to change, maybe make the maid agency do spot checks if they don't hear from a maid in a while."
24026,maids need training in spotting and dealing with abusive employers
24027,makes it so so difficult for expats - and you cant even get a VTP without booking 3 days in advance.
24028,"whenever racism is brought up, singaporeans tend to stand staunchly by the view that it has been eradicted but imo it’s just hiding plain sight."
24029,"sure there aren’t racial riots like there used to be but racism has just taken another form– slights, outdated stereotypes and blatant exclusion hidden as ""preference""."
24030,"many chinese and indian immigrants elsewhere started from zero, including the early chinese settlers here."
24031,"many expats have just an empty apartment, they don't cook at home, and many have a good salary, and specially the one from england/irland etc the pub is not just a bar, its a second home, they are happy sit there whole evening and drink beer with friends."
24032,those who never had a chance or voice to speak out about racism are now speaking out?
24033,"maybe there has always been racism, but only now people adversly affected are able to have their voices hear?"
24034,maybe you can ask your minority friends (if you have any) whether there is racism in signapore or how they have been affected by it?
24035,maybe start with some empathy cos you just disregarded racist jokes.
24036,racist jokes they dont exist in a vacuum.
24037,people dont just make racist jokes about indians and treat them well in every other aspect of life.
24038,"if you want to employ a maid, you need to have WiFi installed and purchase any smartphone for the maid."
24039,+ make them check in with the smartphone with the maid agency once a month for the first year of employment.
24040,Boon keng seems like a better choice to live in if you're worried about the foreign workers or noise.
24041,"i'm sure there's plenty of xenophobia from Singaporeans but if you're going to accuse Singaporeans of being xenophobic, please pick a quote from a Singaporean being xenophobic."
24042,"Two migrant workers witnessed it, and kindly came forth to help lift up the drain cover n retrieved it for me...."
24043,"meh, if go by race none of my immediate family can speak our mother tongue (my grandmother was adopted into a family of different race so didn’t learn her “correct” mother tongue)."
24044,migrant workers are not delegates.
24045,"some NGO should just organise a symposium for migrant workers to attend, then they can dine out in groups of 5.  how are we not ashamed?"
24046,micro-aggressions are the preferred mode of racism here
24047,migrant workers don't live in hdb flats with their parents/grandparents.
24048,minority or majority also can be victim of racism.
24049,all forms of racism must be denormalized
24050,mmm xenophobia is bad mkkkay?
24051,I'm only complaining that the author's use of racism is in the wrong context.
24052,People have been tossing around racist around that it's lost its meaning.
24053,Also because there's no noun for a person has xenophobia (xenophobic person?).
24054,later all these people accuse us of racism
24055,"I would liken it (a bit of a stretch, I know) to the foreign worker situation."
24056,more segregation of foreign workers...
24057,"in my own social circle, i think at the very maximum, maybe 10% could be closet racists (the number is probably much lower)."
24058,"even when i step out of my social circle, such as during ns reservist, i don't see more than 10% possibly being closet racists."
24059,"in any case, online prejudice against foreigners seems to me to be non-racist; whites, mainland chinese, indians, filipinos, etc are all equal targets of hostility."
24060,most Singaporeans i know treat their maids like literal slaves and see them like second class citizens.
24061,These are the same entitled pieces of shit that the maids take care of.
24062,most ang mohs come from countries where having live in maids arent common so they usually treat them nicer.
24063,IMO a lot of the mistreatment of maids by sinkies comes from social learning.
24064,"most covert racists are fine with you as long as you ""know your place and stay in your lane""."
24065,"It might actually turn out to be cheaper than a live in maid, plus you get much more flexibility."
24066,most expats are mad because they can't get the same package back in their home country and they know it.
24067,many expats I know (with families) cannot imagine life without a domestic helper now.
24068,mostly used by special snowflakes that no longer have their safe space to spout racist stuff.
24069,"my chinese friend used to call malays dumb and would call every brown thing he saw stupid (brown car, cardboard box etc)  hes not racist anymore so thats good"
24070,my domestic helper has been with me and my family for the past 15 (reaching 16 years) im 15 this year and my family treats her as family.
24071,"my family and domestic helpers relationship may be an anomaly but i really do appreciate every domestic helper that goes out of their way just to earn money for their family and come to singapore to work such a low paying, and hard job"
24072,my maid actually came from this agency.
24073,the people in this agency definitely do not treat their maids like products.
24074,"The money lender couldnt care less, they just kept sending letters to the domestic helper's legal address in Singapore"
24075,"also, AFAIK, the purpose of the levies is not to provide better conditions for migrant workers, but to regulate how many of them work in Singapore."
24076,"that aside, I agree that there should be (a lot) more transparency regarding spending on migrant workers' issues."
24077,"unless the specific person supporting BLM is a racist against local malay/indians, i dont see what's so hypocritical about it."
24078,Singaporeans *love* expats.
24079,I've heard of maids putting up black magic stuff at home (more than one actually) etc and that kind of feeds into paranoia among other owners.
24080,"I've heard the wi-fi thing before where after my distant relatives maid got wi-fi access she got became alot less attentive to work and all that, i mean its not to be unexpected, we see the same with kids and their mobile phones all the time."
24081,"Of course not, but horror stories like these do make people more wary and thus more 'strict' on their maids."
24082,"I don't have the stats plus people are going to say its unreported, and its not like you're going to get maid agencies telling you how many maids get returned to their agencies or back home."
24083,"this is why I am against of foreign maid, already this society is filled with 1st world spoil brats (adults too)."
24084,"a maid is still a human , who the hell lock a human in a partition?"
24085,new batch of expats will come.
24086,expats are all basically short term benefits transitory mindset driven anyway.
24087,that maid deserves justice and the employer her punishments
24088,"no choice mah,  the SJW's will short circuit any discussion by accusing me of being racist or xenophobe."
24089,"as a halfie i can relate only a little, of course i don't experience racism as blatant."
24090,"no need to mention foreign worker or anything ,  he is a kindhearted human being thats all we need to know."
24091,"there is no theoretical upper limit to the number of VTPs that may be issued, but there is a clear limit to the number of VTL flights each day (current VTL daily quota is 4000 from 13 VTL countries - this is the actual number that limits how many pple may come in)."
24092,"it is the VTL quota that limits, not the VTP pass."
24093,"no to racism, yes to diarrhoea"
24094,"no, I think he meant that the immigrants will vote in favor of the current government, countering the votes of the ""awakened"" locals."
24095,"As a foreigner working in this country, I must say, I am not eligible to vote, and this argument is not quite correct (unless of-course immigrants eventually gain citizenship in the longer run)."
24096,"no, actually there's no change for current VTL status other than the relaxation of testing (on arrival ART instead of PCR)."
24097,What excites me was the announcement that the government will slowly move to using vaccination status as border requirement and ditch the concept of VTL.
24098,"Well, for what's worth, this is the first time MMTF says they are willing to drop VTL at some point."
24099,"no, the reason fall of society is when live-in maids are considered acceptable (1-2 days off a month) - even a necessity to some, but instead complain when maids aren't allowed to use condo facilities."
24100,"nobody read the article, they're here to bash expats"
24101,got ielts?
24102,non-entry level...more than 2/3 years of experience...many such expats are barely 30.
24103,just pure unabetted racism
24104,"nope, according to r/sg you must be willing to marry any race and gender otherwise you are a racist and sexist"
24105,racism against blacks isn't really a thing here.
24106,singapore has a long history of immigrants settling in stretching from the colonial times.
24107,"not just maids, the bangladesh construction workers too"
24108,pity after 50 years of nation building there is still so much widespread racism.
24109,not only racist but also sexist.
24110,thought it was pretty racist and condescending to make those comments....   🤷🏻‍♀️
24111,not peddling a racist conspiracy theory that trump is yelling about?
24112,not racist at all.
24113,"also not uncommon for after me saying I am singaporean to say ""ah ok then I can tell you ah... (insert some xenophobic shit here)"""
24114,sincerely hope racism will cease man
24115,"not sure about other parts but from what I have seen in EDMW at hardwarezone, expats won't be welcomed over there"
24116,"not surprised with the response, Asians and racism go hand in hand."
24117,"Beyond that though, I will say Asians in general are the most racist ppl I have encountered."
24118,And they are fine with it (or dont even think they are being racist) until they are on the receiving end.
24119,"i personallt feel its a good thing  im not xenophobic, but its just that the competition for jobs these days are getting very intense."
24120,"perhaps smaller companies would choose to hire locals as we might be ""cheaper"" than some expats, but given the same salary a lot of companies would hire expats."
24121,alternatively a lot of companies prefer to hire expats as they are from the same countries the company is based in  i think with expats leaving more Singaporeans can be promoted to higher positions and have better future in their company.
24122,"if expats can do a job, why cant Singaporeans do it too?"
24123,not to mention there are countries who need expats more than us to manage their companies
24124,"not when ART kits are unavailable/""expensive""  /justsaying  i remember viewing a vlog on the SG-MY VTL experience and the vlogger mentioned they had to video their ""entire"" ART test experience to submit to the clinic before they get marked as pass and cleared in their MySejahtera"
24125,all landlords in singapore are racist xenophobic sexist and discriminates people who can’t have an occupation to afford a higher rent.
24126,All governments are racist xenophobic sexist and discriminates people who are not in the line of work that is desired when issuing visas.
24127,at least this old lady tried to cover her racism.
24128,"And fk me, it's racist to associate Malay wedding with Hari Raya!"
24129,"notice that they didn't publicise about doing this for the foreign workers, it's just Mothership."
24130,now he will be remembered as a Chairman that loses court battle against the maid.
24131,now you should have a better idea how being a domestic helper in singapore feels like.
24132,"With FWDs working 12-16 hours as stay in maids, the cost would be so prohibitive."
24133,"Unlike HK, where maids are not stay-in."
24134,"Next, FDWs aid the gender equality cause significantly."
24135,Look at Japan where stay-in maids are virtually non-existent (too expensive).
24136,Can you imagine a Singapore without FDWs?
24137,"obviously singapore's stronger currency lends itself to an asymmetry of power when hiring foreign workers and many of them come here with debt due to hiring agencies charging exorbitant fees and this issue is far more complex than you're implying, but go off   also consider that the 'woke' millennials understand that being paid below $600 doesn't get you very far in Singapore, and that maids are people who have aspirations of saving up too"
24138,if u want all chinese to take responsibility for racism in sg then u gotta take responsibility for the radical fringes of the left as well.
24139,growing up my mother would make comments about wanting to get face surgery to male her face “less PRC” because many people (especially caucasian expats/people from other countried when we travel) will assume we are PRC chinese
24140,"oh hi there, imagining racist/xenophobe guy."
24141,"still can't find any racist/xenophobic comments that you accused me of i see...  why would you make friends over the internet, is your life so pathetic that it revolves around online friends?"
24142,"but most PAP politicians have lost their hearts, with decisions like teachers losing parking privileges, little done for foreign worker protection (just off the top of my head)."
24143,and erm.. gradual removal of VTL concept!
24144,"&#x200B;  >Instead of VTLs with selected countries, Singapore should transition towards opening up for all vaccinated travellers, he added."
24145,"Instead of an abrupt change, Singapore will take the first step now by simplifying the current border restrictions for non-VTL travellers."
24146,"oh its not a problem guys, thats not racism at all, just 'preferences'"
24147,oh lol yep  i said the too good thing because i noticed the expats tend to live in their own cluster and don't take advantage of the good things around them - i think they'd have a much more fulfilling experience if they stepped out of their comfort zone
24148,"even LKY understood there is a limit, over which more immigrants become a net loss   >I am not sold on 6.5 million..."
24149,"I don't think of myself as racists ( who do lol ) but I don't pride on myself as ""oh i have multiple < other racial > friends etc""   I just don't care about them."
24150,"( don't pick fights with strangers, don't attract attention by shouting etc, feel free to wear whatever you want, I will just ignore that )  hmm how to not sound racist in the next part...  so for example, if someone has a large family and is broke, I would say to others if we are talking about the person that, ""so-and-so should have less kids"" instead of ""aiya, of course he is broke."
24151,"secondly, is it racism if i associate certain behaviour with certain race which are established by studies or published facts?"
24152,a person from another race (if he or she is not afraid to be called racist after publishing)?
24153,ok...but are you actually comparing your situation to foreign workers rn?
24154,"but u cant deny with a chorus verse of ""chinese ppl always fucking it up"" that just seems like racism too?"
24155,"like the questions are so random, and then I realized its those racist questions again"
24156,"omg, dat racist guy deserved it but that Indian guy shouldn't had resort to violent as well, but will happen to our community?!?!?!!!"
24157,http://www.theindependent.sg/expat-leaving-to-usa-lack-of-interestingness-makes-it-hard-to-love-singapore/
24158,"finally (this may come off as controversial), i would actually treat the blm movement and the racial issues in sg as separate issues; racism/violence against the blacks in america have existed since a long time ago (as far back as 1619 when slaves were first brought over --- i may be wrong about this, feel free to correct me)."
24159,"who knows, this may be the one thing that starts conversations (as i mentioned previously) and introduce effective change in our, admittedly, racist society."
24160,"on the subject of racism being dealt with by the law and not society itself, singaporeans take a very hands off approach to social justice it seems."
24161,"one only needs to consider say, the number of halal restaurants you can find in say, the foodcourt in MBS or even the food court at Vivo or some other malls to look at the extent of systemic racism, sometimes there are none..."
24162,"this clarion call for ardent down-voting of 'xenophobic' posts is a form of victim-heckling, which is reminiscent of what the early feminists faced."
24163,only if you wanna be xenophobic about it
24164,They had a couple of migrant workers volunteer openings.
24165,or rather  >More than half of migrant workers received free Covid-19 vaccine before Singaporean does!
24166,or they use it as a bargaining chip to get a transfer maid like your case
24167,"or you can just enact a new law against xenophobia, mirring it with racism in the process, and arrest all the netizens!!"
24168,or... he's just racist
24169,"you want maid you pay, no more lowballing!"
24170,(like me)  hopefully those with young kids find good hearted maids to match their own kind hearts; shoutout to my cousin and her wonderful maid who is treated like family and beloved by my nephews!
24171,"other countries do not have an incentive to play this VTL game invented by Sg, especially since the vol."
24172,"ouch,poor maid"
24173,of course is current immigration influx fast is debatable because we have large number of immigrants since independent.
24174,Malaysia are immigrants back then.
24175,people are racist due to exposure.
24176,This is why people are racist.. due to exposure from the majority
24177,"people are remarkably friendlier, though it might possibly because of being not as open as SG to the world.rental contracts and relations with the landlord... here what i feel like the contracts are favoring the landlords, which is actually understandable given the amount of foreign workers here.another nice thing back in china was the gifts... whatever you buy online there is always some gift from the seller, it is not big or sth, but just a nice gesture imho.law enforcement is ""usually"" friendly for foreigners, you simply act stupid or genuinely admit that you didnt know certain law, you are just allowed to go (though for this part i havent had experience in SG, so not a good part to compare i guess)and ofc there are bunch of shitty stuff over there, censorship and iron fist of the gov't, so those are the bad sides.queueing and crowd... this is actually sth nice in SG."
24178,"people have a thousand ways to argue about how this is NOT racism...if you ask some of these people about what would actually be racist, they just go silent or double down and insist on ""muh property"" or something"
24179,"personally, as a chinese person who had minimal contact with malays prior to NS, i was under the belief that our racial integration efforts were successful and that racism is only restricted to a minority (pun not intended) group of people."
24180,plenty of expats choose the stay around geylang.
24181,"the only people with problems are the low wage migrant workers who face surveillance by cameras and infrared detectors everywhere, and are put up in illegal accommodations that are sublet and crammed with multiple tenants in tight spaces."
24182,what i mean is that we all understand racism and what defines a racism comment or what not.
24183,(therefore we are 'racists' at heart) we just do not say it out loud due to the implications it has due to the nature of our multi racial society.
24184,"point is, singaporeans aren't as good at distinguishing locals from expats as they think they are, which is why locals are saying they're increasingly facing racism."
24185,pointing out racism and being racism is a totally thing   thats the main argument that people are putting out after digesting and reading through her post
24186,poor maid.
24187,ppl racist mah.
24188,And will there be any racism or anything since im kinda white?
24189,Didn't come across as too negative IMO - I like that the people interviewed had empathy and were aware of the horrifying news of maid abuses earlier this year
24190,pretty sure your downvoters will call for regulations to be implemented so employers will have to spend more to transport migrant workers.
24191,when it comes to money it's always secondary to the safety of migrant workers who are the backbone of singapore's construction industry EXCEPT when it comes to my personal money
24192,prob because other recent spate of racist incidents.
24193,"just like all those foreign talents that enter the country, why can’t Singaporeans go elsewhere too if the going gets tough."
24194,afaik singapore have like very little people who are racist anyway   the most racist things i met was probably people thinking those FT are smelly but thats about all
24195,questioning if you should stand against racism concerns me but good job yung jedi ... you did well
24196,"quick question, do you have a racist or xenophobe, maybe even a bigot just for fun behind your closet at home?"
24197,"my profile is public, so yeah, feel free to find the racist/xenophobe comment you claim I made."
24198,"quite sure that preetipls was ascribing systemic racism, not individual racist motivations  in any case she was punished for it, and plus, honestly doubt her types dominate the media lol."
24199,r we racists?
24200,r/accidentalracism
24201,"I remember seeing a comment that went 'Aha' because Singapore didn't count the death of a migrant worker who died in a workplace accident as a 'covid death', just because that worker *had* the virus."
24202,I studied in the UK and I faced some racism as an Asian Asian person (as in not Brit) and not only from chavs (the staff at the local chippy made “Ching Chong Cheng” sounds when I ordered).
24203,"But let’s be honest, some racism will always be present anywhere where there is a minority race."
24204,"I’m not suggesting we accept that and move on, but that we need to have a more nuanced view of what we consider racist behavior and base any real world decisions around that"
24205,racism exists everywhere.
24206,politicians pander to racism to win votes.
24207,racism has no place in society but its ok for landlords to be racist because they own the house.
24208,"racism is caused by assimilation, pack it up sociologists   seriously this is the state of anti-intellectualism in sg"
24209,"racism is everywhere bro, I am not saying that it is good but its a fact of life that everybody who is different from the majority around him/her will be picked on sooner or later"
24210,racism is the action of discriminating against a race.
24211,"having preferences, while it might stem from a person's racist tendencies, might not necessary be the case."
24212,The point here is there is not enough evidence to call him a racist and more so to report him.
24213,"Sure the solution is not perfect as it is thought out in less than 30 seconds but if we go by the view that the solution is racist, then all minority rights groups in sg are also considered racist since they are handing out benefits for the minorities."
24214,racism.
24215,XTREME racism!!
24216,racism?
24217,racist boomer.
24218,racist fuck
24219,racist idiots exist everywhere
24220,"re that post yesterday about SG Olympics: i seriously wanted to suggest OP add racism as a sport, but thought it would just be met with delusionary denial  SG society is deeply racist & it's hilarious when people get outraged about phrases like ""_____ *privilege"" and in the same breath stay silent about toxic problems like in the OP  just revolting"
24221,currently see too much enclaves since we get immigrants from the same few countries.
24222,"read this blog post some time ago, may explain some stuff  http://vivitelaeti.blogspot.sg/2013/11/m-for-maids-m-for-murder.html"
24223,really sad to see such racism in our Singapore:(((
24224,"but sadly nobody really cares about you in your sad sorry life, so obviously to find meaning in life you have to go on the internet and seek validation by finding imaginary racists and xenophobes, maybe even bigots since you already at it, why not right to showcase your 'wokeness'."
24225,most of my friends and relatives treat their maids as part of their family.
24226,but i’ve seen so many news cases of horrible treatment on domestic workers as well..
24227,but surely there will be differences in the ticket prices vis-a-vis VTL vs non-VTL flights?
24228,reasonable salary - nett cost of a skilled foreign worker after levies would still be lower than a local + cpf contributions… oh and they don't have reservist obligations to fvck with your manpower planning  reasonable working hours - these are not 9-5 industries… they are project based so they have deadlines to meet… you can't expect to knock off at 5pm when something is scheduled for 6pm and unforeseen factors delay the completion till 9pm… and those skilled foreign workers ain't complaining
24229,it's easy to hide behind the keyboard and write jokes which they (knowingly or unknowingly xenophobic) might be seeking social acknowledgement for.
24230,but by that same token I don't see why we have a special responsibility to accommodate immigrants beyond what the rest of the developed world is willing to do.
24231,"in fact, compared to places like the US/Eu/Aus where there is outright racism, violence and discrimination against even ""high wage"" immigrants we are already very inclusive."
24232,particularly towards high wage western immigrants given the prevalence of post-colonial attitudes here.
24233,"reminds me of a friend who was also very close to her maid and made her mum cry when she was young during an argument:  ""tell you for what, you also not around everytime"""
24234,pay 1 million dollar dont want to see maids using the swimming pool.
24235,"i'd like to think maybe being exposed to the racism that blm has showcased would make people more open to discussing and standing against racism and discrimination here, and for some people that's the case!"
24236,but for others somehow they categorise racism as a western thing only.
24237,sg is multiracial means no racism hahaha.
24238,or harbour ill feelings towards their maid.
24239,these people should be banned from hiring maids and should be jailed and cained.
24240,saying Apunehneh is racist?
24241,"oh nvm, it's racist because you were offended by it right?"
24242,"expats leaving, losing covid resilient standing blah blah and super exaggeration comes in etc."
24243,i can bring in other preferences a landlord has that you guys can nitpick with being unfair BUT treating this as a singular racist issue is a stereotype on the thinking process of a landlord.
24244,Stereotyping people based on race is not that different from racism.
24245,seeing them say how these migrant workers should be glad they still got a job just irks me
24246,seems also like a scheme to get past foreign worker quota.
24247,"(ie: if a recruiter snags a singaporean on their payroll, how many foreign workers can get tagged in as well)"
24248,seems like a xenophobic tirade if I ever saw one
24249,seen this it reminds of this one meme I saw on Instagram  like   kids and women: help    everyone: ok \*\*helps in some shit   men or young males: help   everyone: Be A mAn Bro   I am only scratching the surface what makes it worst that now females are having more power it even worst the simps on broad(I am not joking)  it is also the thing as racism when people talk about it their brain turns off     that my take on it
24250,https://www.sembmarine.com/2021/10/16/update-on-situation-at-westlite-jalan-tukang-dormitory
24251,she can just have her maid replaced.
24252,she made the maid sign a confession that she stolen food.
24253,she watched the maid bathe herself without any clothes and had the husband watch her dry herself without a towel.
24254,But there is really no need to qualify it by mentioning  that she is an expat.
24255,"shhhh...Breaking the narrative of the *suffering* expat, in an Asian country, Singapore not living up to European ideals?"
24256,should make her compensate the poor maid's family too!
24257,xenophobic or not those are the facts.
24258,that’s when it really hit me how poorly we are actually treating the migrant workers here with little regard for their safety and lives.
24259,"singapore isn’t perfect but after living in another country all my life and hearing racist comment frequently, singapore was the first place i didn’t get racist comments like “cHINg cHong eyes” all the time  so to a young version of me, when i came to singapore, i felt like i was accepted for the first time"
24260,singaporeans should not even be allowed to hire domestic workers judging by the amount of cases of maid abuse we have.
24261,so MoM has effectively ordered companies to give a salary increment for s pass and employment pass holders?
24262,so an event of boss shouting is enough to call it quit (maids?)...
24263,so give your maid a housing allowance or provide housing
24264,"so if i say i am more comfortable around a person of race A instead of race B after what i deem is a personal assessment based on a MULTITUDE OF FACTORS including race, am i being racist?"
24265,"so if the employer say ""alamak what happen in afganistan"" the maid suddenly become terrorist?"
24266,shouldn’t there be an OSHA kind of thing but for domestic helpers??
24267,or maybe a union to protect the rights and safety of domestic helpers in sg?
24268,so singaporeans are unable to criticise qatar because the migrant worker situation here is so shit?
24269,"furthermore due to systemic racism, whites are also more likely to RECIEVE help, be it in the form of handouts or employment."
24270,"the sub would call anyone who said ""china virus"" or ""wuhan virus"" racist, whereas a lot of people are seemingly fine with it being called ""the indian variant"""
24271,At least I get racism for races that aren't even mine.... :/
24272,so what % of those foreign workers tested were positive?
24273,am i racist?
24274,"I'm not attacking all Chinese people, I'm attacking the system that excuses reactions to passive racism as minorities being oversensitive."
24275,so you think racism is okay.
24276,So long as you specify what kind of racism and stick with it?
24277,so you're just okay with racism as long as it's masquerading as private business
24278,so your maid sleeps on the floor...?
24279,"heck, anyone's mouth is a hell hole (good luck trying to debate COVID-19 spread to racist uncles, you kinda reach the point where you just want to like facepalm to the moon and back)."
24280,they dont other than hello good bye.......... lived in expat bubble.
24281,"some are here because ... you heard that old saying FILTH: ""Failed In London Try HK"" (except they can't even make it to HK so they're here in singapore), and they give expats a bad name: overpaid, underworked, totally useless."
24282,if expats cant find a local food they dont like kinda reflects on them rather than the singapore food scene.
24283,"some kind of wine reseller, 3000 bottles of wine are they using maids as normal employees?"
24284,some singaporeans are racist  water may not be dry after all
24285,sorry im not really educated on the situation thr i just heard about the racism happening due to the Euros haha
24286,sorry to burst your bubble but not everything around you is a stereotype -_- and its borderline racist especially coming from an environment that touts itself to be multi cultural with different dialects.
24287,Do you feel that this discrimination is a product of institutionalized racism?
24288,:(  i was just so sure that my way of thinking works in reducing racism for the general ppl.
24289,"don't expect to be mollycoddled and praised for your apathy/""neutrality"", unlike those who might put you on a pedestal for not actively perpetuating racism."
24290,sounds like he was he giving advice rather than expressing his own racist view.
24291,stereotyping based on race is actually racism though?
24292,"stuff you read in this article will never see the light of day in mainstream media...  the part about the cost of each foreign worker got me thinking... instead of cutting the worker levy, which may not benefit the fw ultimately, the government could allocate a portion of the foreign worker levy into a sink fund that can be put to improve the conditions at the dormitories... this can be audited to ensure there is no misuse... but end of the day... those sneaky unscrupulous types are bound to find a way to siphon off these funds for their own benefit"
24293,"are we just getting these foreign talent to fill the need ""immediately"" rather than acquiring our own resources for the longer term?"
24294,"such a weird take, racism excusing racism, culture war accounts are nuts"
24295,"My mother tongue as a yellow skinned person was certainly not mandarin, and i was definitely screwed over by the fact that mandarin was the defacto mother tongue for all yellow skins like me."
24296,"But from your reply you seem like you are in the crowd strongly against SAP schools along with so called chinese privilege, so i doubt anything can change your mind, though i would happily discuss further as I spent much time reading about SAP schools and their histories (or at least about my own alma mater)  You would call all this systemic racism, but i would call this the result of freedom, and it is the manifestation of equality of opportunities rather than that of equality of outcomes."
24297,"sure, I’m saying that for us all to be less racist, it’s actually a lot easier to do so."
24298,tbf im malay and the only count of racism I've experienced so far is my ex's mum (chinese who grew up in malaysia) not liking me (and disapproving our relationship) because of my race.
24299,i assume that's why racism exist right?
24300,"tbh expats make up the minority of foreigners working in singapore, majority are S-pass or work permit workers"
24301,"tbh i myself have also had it with the number of singaporeans posting about blm, but not because i believe that racism in america isn’t for us to comment on (it absolutely is, and i 100% support the blm movement)."
24302,tbh mother tongue is not a mandatory subject after pri school.
24303,tbh singapore is almost too good a place for expats - as long as you don't get cocky and start posting racist/xenophobic shit online.
24304,just don't limit yourself only to a community of expats or a certain area - be open-minded and inoffensive and i think you'd enjoy yourself
24305,tell the maid to put that in her CV.
24306,"on your example, you should note that landlords can be non racist and make economic decisions based on criteria available to them, such as race and gender."
24307,there are non racist landlords who makes rental decisions based on criteria that include not only race but here you are picking out race as a single point of attack when it’s actually about sexism as well.
24308,"i'm chinese and in maybe the past 5 years i've become more cognisant of my own passive racism, partially bc many singaporeans (especially chinese) are so used to thinking we are this racially progressive society when we really aren't - our issues are just hidden enough that i had the privilege of not thinking it existed."
24309,"frankly i agree about the issue where foreigners are racist against chinese people bc i feel like chinese people who are prejudiced against malays/indians here are so laughably unaware that this is literally the treatment they will possibly get in a caucasian country, yet somehow it's okay for us to treat local singaporeans the same way."
24310,"TBH i find myself siding with most of the policies that (most) opposition parties are campaigning for i.e  1) more welfare for the poor and unemployed  2) Abolishment of 377A  3) Freedom of speech  4) More support for the Arts  5) Recognition of non-traditional family structures  6) Lower cost of living  However, the only thing stopping me from giving my vote to the opposition is their extremely anti-xenophobic rhetoric."
24311,imagine gatekeeping racism with nationality
24312,"thanks for posting about twc2, i’ve wanted to help out migrant workers but i didn’t really know how, and because of this post and the link, i got to donate!"
24313,"thanks for sharing so clearly...more people need to speak up...& people need to admit that such discriminatory hiring/work practices exist, instead of crying xenophobia."
24314,"that's why i am actively trying to avoid sounding like i'm a racist against malays because i really don't feel anything strongly against malays in general, it's just that my personal experiences have left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
24315,"so nice of you :)    u said singaporean’s don’t owe expats/ foreigners anything, but i think u owe me the basic decency of sparing me from your long paragraph of you defending your “crude racist humour” and ranting about why you don’t like expats/ foreigners  if i’m not wrong this post was about me happy to be getting my pr, think u ended up in the wrong thread leh."
24316,that includes the testing from the foreign worker dorms.
24317,"There is a backlog because they can't test the whole population all at once, so that number reflects those who already have it and we are only now finding out about it The entire foreign worker community is effectively isolated now."
24318,"that's a misconception...the grass is not neccessary greener overseas and certainly in this current times (i am not talking about covid but protectionalism), more and more countries (regardless it's east or west) are now favoring their own locals instead of foreign expats due to political pressures and globalization pushback."
24319,"that's clearly discrimination, but how is it systemic racism?"
24320,As long as you have booked a VTL ticket before the selling freeze you can change it.
24321,that's more classism than racism but ok.
24322,"If you calculate, let's say an FDW's active working hours are 10 hours per day, 1 month = 260 hours (excluded sundays), that amounts to only $3.80/hour!"
24323,"And these are considered the more expensive FDW, the average FDW earns way less."
24324,"that's not a fine, to this kind of filthy rich ppl it's just an additional tax for hiring a FDW"
24325,"that's pretty funny considering how racist most Australians are towards any Asians stepping into their country, be it for a holiday, long term stay, undergrad study etc."
24326,"My grandma has a maid as well, but she's treated like a family member."
24327,"I really can't tolerate it when people treat maids as somehow 'lesser', I think you can report that, its illegal"
24328,"there are expats who work in singapore and bring their families here, and some companies actually pay for their accomm and their children's education expenses."
24329,no one deserves to suffer from racism and bullying from narrow-minded racism
24330,that’s why they hire foreign workers in the first place because they can get away with cheap labour.
24331,but yea live in maids are such a wrong idea.
24332,maids are people you employ not own.
24333,I hope we can make a law for compulsory to have mattress on bed in dormitory
24334,the article opening with such a lead says a lot about singaporeans’ attitudes towards maids
24335,"the author seems to think the term itself is ""racist hatred of white people"", and ""anti-white sentiment"" when it isn't."
24336,"Even if it's supposedly a copy and paste (it is not), it isn't racist in the first place."
24337,the author's racist for sharing her experiences of being on the receiving end of racism from chinese people?
24338,the case went on for 3 yrs.which means no income for the maid and no money to send to her family.
24339,similarly if there is only one indian guy in the movie and he is made to potray an accent thats racist.
24340,the definition of racism should not be determined by majority or minority.
24341,But what is racist about this?
24342,"The most ridiculous kind of racism is ""I feel it's racist so the world should think so too""."
24343,">but literally companies have to search for local talents first and then look for a foreigner to grant such pass  under the new system we can get rid of this requirement, as well as the many other onerous regulations and quotas regarding the hiring of foreign workers."
24344,the doctor treat the migrant workers as one of us.
24345,seems this subreddit filled with expats
24346,"the explanations becoming more contrived... the maid stole my stuff, why yes!"
24347,the fact that specific provision was made in traffic law to allow only migrant workers to be ferried in unsafe conditions already says enough about singapore.
24348,the fuck is an expat student
24349,the infections are racist /s
24350,"the jail time is not enough, and the sentence will not deter other maid abusers."
24351,so share any racist experience you have had here.
24352,the maid can quit if she doesnt like it.
24353,the maid died in 2016 so 6 years ago?
24354,"the maid is there to help out with the routine household chores, and not as a primary caregiver for young children."
24355,the maid might be bad at her work for all we know but u can still teach her how to do stuff no need to act up pile that.
24356,the maid really too dumb lol
24357,This means we will always have more foreign companies than local companies and thus more “privileged expats” of these foreign companies parachuted into SG in their tenure to Higher management
24358,the migrant workers smelly because they build our fucking homes/offices/malls/wherever so don't fucking complain they smelly.
24359,We got more than enough foreign talents that is willing to work in singapore.
24360,"for my domestic helper, she gets sunday off as her free day, but even then can you imagine working in your corporate setting from 6am to 10pm for six days a week?"
24361,the most racism i got in australia was a drunk dude in 7/11 asking me where Chinatown was.
24362,Other than that any form of alleged racism is just the dishonest media just trying to shove a narrative down our throats
24363,to call yourself a feminist and advocate for equality is like calling yourself a member of the KKK and believing against racism!
24364,not the actual people in the post committing racist acts?
24365,"from a quick google search that's literally the definition of racism: the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities  &#x200B;  edited to add the text after the colon because for some reason it was left out originally."
24366,the problem is due to lack of standardization...as in the Blacks said the N word like no other business and then a non-black just joking spouted or wrote it and that guy became a racist.
24367,"If we are going to accept that word as offensive, then the blacks should not say it too..  if a word can only be allowed to be said by one race and not another, that is racism itself, don't you think?"
24368,"There are more indians and the problem here are still the racist ones who see tamils as fckin bad people and as a telugu indian , exeryone thinks ur tamil."
24369,Personally i have no obligation against tamils but the racist ppl really make the situation disgusting.
24370,Tamil ppl are good ppl but the racists are bringing it to a situation where associating with them makes  u a equal with them .
24371,"One thing us new generations have to remember is once the older racist fuckers die off , the problem will recide ."
24372,the sad thing is the maids don't know these things about their own kids back home as well.
24373,the same minister who survived 2020 election and made minister again and who said :   # 'I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology'  Trust PM to be stronger than that to let the plague continues
24374,the sheer insolence and/or stupidity of these callous racists.
24375,Maybe there should be a transfer fee just like football players  for  domestic workers to be paid to existing owner for bringing them over if contract is not completed .
24376,the true test is whether more VTLs will be announced soon
24377,"the wording of the headline is simultaneously laughable, depressing and revealing of how we see FDWs lmao"
24378,"other than the racism point, the rest seems pretty normal and expected in just about every work environment."
24379,you can devalue opinions of racists and educate rationale people
24380,then the agency needs to be investigated and severely punished if found true for double charging both the maid and the employers for miscellaneous and service fee
24381,there are a bunch of expats just like you in this thread.
24382,"there are a lot of comments (re: calling out xenophobia) here that are downvoted to oblivion just read any thread from the past few days and sort by controversial, don't just read the top comment."
24383,there are different types of expats in singapore:   * those sent to singapore by their company.
24384,*expats* in the classical sense.
24385,"there are people reselling VTL flights to KL for 350-500 RETURN PER PERSON Genuinely, I hope these people encounter traffic jams for the rest of their lives whenever they’re in a rush to get places."
24386,there is no lockdown or migrant worker's rights violations in Ba Sing Se.
24387,there is no wrong tree to bark   whether its CECA CECB CECC CECD CECE CECF or whatever law there is   as long as it have anything to do with allowing FT to come in people are going to blame it on them   Its either people blame these laws or they blame PAP since there is obviously no way to blame themselves as most people cant ever do that in their life
24388,Why are you worried about these foreign workers spreading covid 19 to the children/allergic when there’s more cases in the community?
24389,there should be a vaccine against racist people.
24390,there was an article posted here not long ago commenting that these 'expats' are leaving in droves.
24391,there's a ton of guides for expats moving to SG.
24392,specific to american expats  thanks!
24393,there's no point in posting BLM posts and stories if you're just going to be racist towards the minorities here in Singapore (i.e.
24394,"generalising Filipinos and Indians as maids and construction workers and using those as insults)  EDIT: i am not putting down Filipinos and Indians in any way, i am just citing examples and i'm sorry if i offend you."
24395,"these are the events 'notable' enough to gain mainstream coverage/discussion, i'm sure people are experiencing racist acts every day"
24396,these people think they can be racist just because they are hiding behind a mask and cannot be caught.
24397,they boil the WHOLE maid  in a minute
24398,like i said its more common than u think go read up any maid forums
24399,and what happened to foreign workers dorm law passed in 2015. got enforce?
24400,"It's 51% ""do not like VTLs"" (OP's phrase)."
24401,"You can think SG needs to open more VTLs faster and still answer ""not satisfied""."
24402,they went all out 180 degree to flip that arnd in the cringe worthy return tray poster  they think they undo racism with some patronizing portrayals of anti stereotypes with chinese summons lady and minority whitecollar carowner
24403,they were so quick to judge the maid the first time round.
24404,"for older kids if transferring from another school/country, they either continue their second language or are exempted from studying mother tongue."
24405,"her older siblings don't take a mother tongue/are exempted, youngest sibling chose to take chinese at p1."
24406,they will face less competition as foreign workers will cost more to hire.
24407,"older HR vets might remember a time when govt was handing out s pass / work permit / employment pass like free so justifying the change in an acceptable way to everyone is nigh impossible (but also gives us golden nuggets like being able to procreate in small spaces), also don't forget there will most likely be geopolitical consequences of implying certain foreign nationalities are cheap (now we talking in r/singapore only, if such stats are really readily available, we probably talk in r/worldnews instead)."
24408,how many innocent maids kena jailed?
24409,"either pay a lot of money for a place that may or may not give proper care to loved ones, or hire a maid that youre at least able to watch  and see if proper care is given  care center sounds nice but unless its as regulated as hospitals are, i dont think a lot of people will like the idea"
24410,The VTL is currently suspended till the end of Jan.  PCR testing (as another person pointed out) is no longer a requirement.
24411,generalizations. .  every country has racism.
24412,think minorities here could give examples of racism they encountered in sg.
24413,"thinking back, everyone was openly making racist jokes about the non-Chinese.... even in their presence."
24414,"edit: I want to state that during that time,  I was no better than those racists jokers: I didn't say anything against them which indirectly condones their actions."
24415,this DJ Kaur gave the NUS molester probation and convicted this poor maid wrongly.
24416,"this article is about how singapore isn't an attractive spot for expats, not about expats having it tough"
24417,"now the thing is many people don't see this - like we banter about our race with our friends all the time, and now the sjws have to come in and call us out for ""casual racism"" and all that!"
24418,the thing is that there really is a distinction between lighthearted banter and casual racism.
24419,"but casual racism is slightly different, it's a form of subtle (not blatant) racism that has been so ingrained into our society that we just accept it as it is."
24420,"rachel pang did a comic on this and she put it (or rather, the psychologist she quoted) best - this form of racism is like a smog, slowly creeping into our lives and we're not aware of it."
24421,"some real concerns, though:  - there is massive resentment in Canada over a perceived influx of Chinese immigrants driving the cost of housing up."
24422,"this is about who takes the bill for returning the maid home, I assume"
24423,"this is fucking disgraceful, if anything, government should remove the levy that they pocket for themselves and have that as a component to FDWs pay."
24424,this is just racist
24425,this is literally a MOM advisory to employers of FDW tho
24426,it IS racist if the unicorn tenant don’t exist and i still outright reject the indian tenant.
24427,this is v racist but..  indian families i feel got 2 kind.
24428,"this is why I'm confused why ppl don't link the fact that the govt is opening the borders for migrant workers to come and do construction work and be domestic maids so ""more educated"" ppl, like singaporeans if they follow the path of what the governmennt set with the bursaries and scholarships and financial aid to cater to a singaporean child education can get better paying jobs, that's why when theres singaporeans that  fall through the cracks maybe due to personal maybe due to a system and society that failed them,have to compete with the migrant workers that don't mind getting lower wages cos the currency exchange rate  makes it so that they don't have to worry about the living expenses of living in sg  like a singaporean has to, even tho increasing migrant workers also mean competition in the higher levels but still we can continue living in a society where cheap construction work leads to quick urban planning for more  efficiency, health care is subsidized, elderly and children can affordably be taken care of by maids, food prices are maintained, although fairprice has lower wages but the prices aren't so cheap ."
24429,"100 dollars says this man is the kind to complain about discrimination from ""ang moh"" people after watching some viral video on facebook (warranted of course, racism is NOT okay towards any group), but yet somehow lacks the self-awareness to realise that he is just as racist as those he rants and raves about."
24430,this one punch maid got off lightly
24431,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/85hwh8/calling_all_minority_races_do_you_have_any_racist/  so thought redo the whole thing and widen the scope of qn.
24432,"this rly debunks the commonly held idea that only uneducated, 'low-class' boomer types can be racists and bigots, when the opposite is just as true."
24433,this sounds dodgy af to me  so you're saying that in this case some random former maid also named Parti Liyani would be liable for libel?
24434,i agree it's mostly xenophobia/nationalism.
24435,"While it is unfortunate that it took covid to shine a spotlight on the migrant worker plight, I'd wager that people today are more sympathetic towards them."
24436,"Yeh.. sure, just parrot the same drivel meant to disregard the countless of lived experiences of indian in singapore when it comes to racism."
24437,"in that case, wouldn’t the premise of renting a house be discriminatory given we can’t use any of the above factors, lest be called a sexist racist or xenophobe?"
24438,note that i am not rationalising racism.
24439,"it’s just that how do you expect me to rent out a place, without using these factors to understand tenants and avoid being called racist sexist etc?"
24440,would i then be collectively shamed as a racist-sexist-culturally insensitive-occupation discriminatory bigot?
24441,April 4  * Case 1106 was linked to Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (3 Apr) but moved to Toh Guan Dormitory (4 Apr).
24442,to be clear I do not mean expats.
24443,"to be fair racism is quite institutionalized here in Singapore, but if you're in the Chinese majority you might not really notice it."
24444,"to me, both would be racist."
24445,"You also need to explain why a relationship with commitment is ""allowed"" to be racist, while a business transaction cannot."
24446,i think calling a whole type of schs with so many different students racist or what is too general.
24447,i dont think other students from non SAP schools are all not racist n the other way round  however i must admit that the n word gets thrown around more than the ball in a game of pick up.
24448,average singaporeans look down on foreign wokers and maids and treat them like sub human.
24449,they should have a min pay of 1.5k etc for a maid.
24450,its not about only rich ppl being able to afford maids but the fact that we pay maids a decent living wage.
24451,should let maids live in dorms and go to individual houses daily to cook and clean.
24452,or get fined for maid getting pregnant.
24453,etc  then you cant push all the problem to a maid.
24454,toxic combination of racism and xenophobia
24455,travelers have to serve full 21 day SHN even if they test negative 4 times  yet they let the maid go after just 5 days when she tests positive?!?
24456,"apparently saying ""it was a joke"" somehow makes someone not racist."
24457,actually the guy who got targetted with a racial joke decides whether you are being racist.
24458,"But religious or not, basic human decency lah not to treat domestic helpers like your rag dolls.."
24459,"they have better instructor , chillax, no fix instructor , you do get occasion old uncles but not racist to the extend you mention."
24460,Is there place where you can report this racism?
24461,"it’s not far-fetched to say though they most likely caught the indian variants since patient zeros in those clusters have them   i won’t deny that there is xenophobia, but attributing the concerns many have to just that alone, and ignoring other factors is also not the right way to discuss this."
24462,"ive read enough horror stories of locked doors, maid raped by their boss, teeth smashing, slapping, stomping, pinching, starving, just really scary how cruel both sides of the spectrum can be, with maids also burning babies hands, stealing, false accusations of abuse."
24463,because its the same ideology that drives the radical fringes and the assertion that certain particulars cultures are inherently racist.
24464,the maid only got to eat  and sit down after all of them finish.
24465,uh that is racism
24466,"uhmm no, we more often still use “katulong” (equivalent of maid) in casual speak."
24467,"um....what's the difference between being ""culturally insensitive"" and ""blind to racism""?"
24468,Just to prove how un-racist you are?
24469,"umm...migrant workers are not citizens  they are residents  not that i agree on this mistreatment, i am just a 2nd class citizen who cannot raise any issues or motions"
24470,unemployed man needs to have maid?
24471,"unless majority recognize the chinese privilege in singapore, racism cannot be addressed"
24472,"unlikely that the facebook post can be POFMA'ed - the only potentially false claim would be with sitoh berating the foreign workers, which is difficult to prove untrue as it is anecdotal."
24473,"you will NOT achieve anything if you continue being a troll online and posting irrelevant, self-pity and wayward stories about domestic workers being taken advantage of."
24474,"every job has its fair share of abuse stories, its not mutually exclusive to domestic workers only."
24475,"yeah domestic workers may have long work hours, that goes for every other job."
24476,"your clear lack of understanding in the whole premise of singaporean domestic worker rights disgust me man, how do you claim yourself to be the social justice warrior of their rights when you don't even know that it is a law that domestic workers are given off days at least once a month?"
24477,"there are already many rules put in place to protect the rights of domestic workers, your ignorance on the issue is abysmal at best."
24478,why don't you cry about maids strangling babies and abusing the elderly then?
24479,whats with this bias towards domestic workers and to only portray them as victims when clearly there is a larger problem with their actions against employers?
24480,are you going to know vilify maids because of a few cases of violence against their employers just like how you vilify everyone because of a few cases of abuse against domestic workers?
24481,or are you going to blame the babies and elderly for forcing the maid to do it because they are left with no choice?
24482,"i dont think any of them in this video have felt singapore's racism since they're not minorities here, they're more like foreigners who migrated here, and if i have learnt anything we tend to be more civil to people who speak with an accent."
24483,im sure if you spoke to a black person who grew up here locally then they would have seen and felt racism first hand.
24484,That has nothing to do with Singapore or expats.
24485,like this also can somehow considered as maid abuse?
24486,wait how did we go the photo use without our permission to this is racist??
24487,wait how is this incident racist..am I the only one missing something here
24488,waiting for this thread to burst into life and call for blood since the same happened when racism happened to a minority race…where’s everyone at?
24489,walao eh yall whining but take a look at this thread and show me one person who say this wasn't a racist attack that should be condemned.
24490,all i see are people complaining that SJWs are going to say that this wasn't racist but i don't even see a single SJW saying that.
24491,"anecdotally, it's ridiculous just thinking back on how many racist incidents and microaggressions occurred due to being in an all chinese school."
24492,"And now, seeing some of these classmates out and about in the working world, having respectable jobs yet still having a closed mind and a racist attitude, unwilling to confront their own privilege and biases."
24493,was the video really racist?
24494,"or was it ""racist""?"
24495,wasn't the foreign worker levy waived for April?
24496,Do you know what xenophobia means???
24497,How does racial violence got anything to do with xenophobia?
24498,"Your further example of ""smaller scales of division"" directly goes against the idea of xenophobia since people are now fighting among themselves."
24499,"It might be racism, yes."
24500,dont blame locals for their mindset evolving into racism and xenophobia but take actions at the root to reverse the this unfortunate behaviour and local culture.
24501,we both detest racists like this.
24502,"we don't need more overpriced, capacity-controlled, baby steps VTLs."
24503,we make billions off the foreign worker levy every year and thats not counting any multipliers
24504,"we only hear about the bad apples, many maids have a decent life making money."

24519,i see the way construction workers or maids get treated i feel so malu.
24520,"well i dont know what debts are owed but in this case it’s the migrant workers paying the debts, it’s not exactly fair to them"
24521,"One of the hardest times watching racism in Sg is when I saw a Bangladeshi lay worker go to a Malay woman for water, she just threw his empty plastic bottle away and told him to go away."
24522,well the US is a gun infested violent shithole but that doesnt stop white and for that matter black ppl from openly saying racist stuff against Asians all the time
24523,So linking this to the new VTL with Germany directly is pointless.
24524,well then I can say 7 month money burning is unhealthy and its very annoying because theres burning everywhere without being racist then.
24525,sure using any one specific metric may be deem unfair but you can’t just pick race as a metric just because it is polarising and say woah landlords are racist.
24526,"well, maybe you shouldn't be part Indian and be racist against Indians."
24527,"if there's anything i've learnt from all the maid abuses and the foreign worker riding on trucks issue, it's that human life ain't equal here after all."
24528,People are racist?
24529,i think i was the racist one.
24530,"went to a sap school, didnt turn out racist."
24531,teachers didnt teach racist thoughts or viewpoint.
24532,"downside i think my school while didnt teach racism, did teach alot of elitism."
24533,what I'm piss off about this is some people take the most ridiculous thing out to social media without any repercussion because of one small incident that sounded racist.
24534,"what I'm trying to clarify is, EP and SP do not need to apply for VTP to come in on VTL under the new rule... but for WP still need right?"
24535,"While maid abuses exist, it doesn't represent the entire population of families who own maids."
24536,there are many avenues of financial help for medical fees  how would you extend your hospitality to this maid then?
24537,what if I get a maid to wash me?
24538,what if I want to make friends with child of expat?
24539,"since they've started slowing down, the so-called 'xenophobia' in singapore that sjws were so eager to call out has simmered down."
24540,so were singaporeans really xenophobic or were they just expressing their anger at the wrong target?
24541,"there are 300k migrant workers in the country, not sure it is economically/physically possible to give them better accommodation to prevent the spread or even isolate those that have got it once the case keeps going exponential like this."
24542,what the fuck is this racism?
24543,what's the source of this 'real meaning of racism'?
24544,"what's up with singaporeans treating maids badly... nowadays those ""woke"" ones call them ""helpers"" and ""domestic worker""... but in the end still treat them like ""servant"""
24545,whats really racist is how she immediately assumes racism instead of thinking of more plausible explanations.
24546,whats wrong with maids using those facilities?
24547,So can the Chinese guy say it’s racist?
24548,"Cb end of the day right, you can only play racist card *if the Malay/Indian guy can sell the HDB more expensive than the Chinese guy and buy the next HDB flat cheaper than the Chinese."
24549,I then started recalling how when i was young i would share my umbrella with maids or strangers when it started raining and i was like “wow is this karma” haha I dont think he’ll ever read this but thank you so much!
24550,when protecting your own citizens take a lower priority than to avoid being branded xenophobic...  our priorities are f\*cked up
24551,"It says in the article ( which is probably biased ), that maids often overspend as a result of peer pressure."
24552,"For a while, I’ve always thought that maids are pretty impressive mentally."
24553,which dormitory?
24554,"which if you look at the sub, are for things that are NOT INTENDED to be about racism, but could be interpreted as such…"
24555,which is how we end up with cases like this: [https://mothership.sg/2020/12/maid-share-bed-104-year-old-man/](https://mothership.sg/2020/12/maid-share-bed-104-year-old-man/)
24556,which ones do you mean-  what about racism against other ethic groups by the majority in a company?
24557,which will be prioritised...anti- racism or property rights?
24558,while FDWs mass-gather in paya lebar & parks.
24559,"Back to the debate, if this is a chinese new year event and an events company goes and grabs a chinese couple's wedding picture, then cut out the face and the wedding couple finds out goes to instagram all is calling out for racism and ignorance, cause they cannot tell the difference between outfits."
24560,"Personally be angry about PDPA, Copyrights etc.. but will I call this out as ignorance and racism?!?"
24561,"while the way you phrased your words may not have been the best, i think the overall message is something that should be echoed: if you're supporting the BLM movement, then carry that same energy to understand the people who have been unfairly targeted on our own shores through defamation suits, ISA, the public order act, etc - stop justifying our state and our treatment of migrant workers and be aware of our response towards minorities in the state media and other channels like preeti nair for what it is."
24562,"while people should definitely take care not to make false equivalences between the treatment of african americans in america w/ the minorities in singapore, everyone's anti-racism sentiments should be echoed in all of the actions that they do."
24563,"to everyone blindly attacking OP's comments, i strongly urge you to read this piece to see where they are coming from: [https://tuition.substack.com/p/9-black-lives-matter-in-singapore?fbclid=IwAR1DFvJtQutS\_UVHp34ctNAoxpTpVztcKqtuTbEu8\_xW7yL9CGZYP3aMS3E](https://tuition.substack.com/p/9-black-lives-matter-in-singapore?fbclid=IwAR1DFvJtQutS_UVHp34ctNAoxpTpVztcKqtuTbEu8_xW7yL9CGZYP3aMS3E)   i do agree that BLM getting traction in singapore does generally have its positive influences on young people and generating conversation, but to simultaneously turn around and ignore the racism happening on our shores is, quite simply, hypocritical."
24564,white = expat.
24565,non-white = immigrant.
24566,but I also am of the opinion that our economic growth would be impossible without the vast number of live in domestic workers.
24567,who says anything about Government not caring about foreign workers?
24568,"when u r predisposed to viewing things under the lens of racism, matters will appear exactly so in that colour"
24569,Problem solved  Housing is essentially a tax on new immigrants.
24570,why do people act like its wrong for them to talk about race when talking about CECA?
24571,do we now just act like a hypocrite and talk about CECA without mentioning indian?
24572,why is this racist?
24573,"if the maid is not alone and has a boyfriend, then you you will pay for her to stay out?"
24574,why isn’t it parents vs maids - the implication is that mums are supposed to know their kid better?
24575,why not give that $1500 to the FDW and give them the freedom to do whatever they want with their money?
24576,"An FDW is not a pet or child that needs constant control and care, they are adults that can take care of themselves."
24577,cancel all the VTLs too!
24578,why you say the word racist?
24579,"with regards to CECA allowing ""unconditional entry of Indian professionals"", would you accept CECA allowing ""free movement of professionals"" as an equivalent?"
24580,"with the proportion of employment pass (EP) holders from india doubled to 25 percent last year, from 14 per cent in 2005 (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/proportion-of-indian-ep-holders-doubled-but-not-a-result-of-more-favourable), were there any misrepresentations?"
24581,"wokeness representing the opposite, they’ll call out racist/discriminatory acts vs rise in nationalism which promotes xenophobic/racist acts"
24582,but this would be close to impossible & have kids if not for domestic workers.
24583,"But the ""affordability"" of domestic workers is the key."
24584,would you rather be born a migrant worker instead?
24585,wow VTL for najib to visit his grandson
24586,"Now, we will start to truly find out if we’re over reliant on foreign workers..."
24587,"ps: no im not a maid, my husband and I greatly feel that way about this situation as well."
24588,"If you are skilled enough to get sponsored or find a job there; too rich to have to care; have a great expat pay package, why *wouldn't* anyone have any objections against migration?"
24589,xenophobia is basically rasicm just in bigger
24590,xenophobia runs high huh lol.
24591,"xenophobia, racism and self hate are able to live together happily in sinkies"
24592,xenophobic comment
24593,"xenophobic comment... there, i've said it"
24594,"with the whole world talking about BLM last year, one would have thought Reddiporeans would be more alert towards incidental / accidental misuse of words, as many (funny or downright horrifying) examples you can see on r/accidentalracism…   but i guess that's really not the case"
24595,"the migrant workers probably dont deserve the cockroaches but no air con should be ok leh, compared to being transported at the back of lorries and risking death"
24596,"if really racist, then a lot of non chinese will be sleeping on the streets lor."
24597,but at least got improve now  wonder which unlucky maid has to suffer next for the system to move another step forward
24598,yah so old uncle aunty also help protect domestic worker from scammers and bad money management.
24599,"Hence, I have no problems with importing foreign talents to fill these roles ""temporarily""."
24600,"i can empathize with the maids, who are exploited by the employers and agencies."
24601,"if the maids get to choose who their employers, some employers might not be happy since the maids like any employee seek better salary & less working hours."
24602,"yea damn it can get hard here as an indian, lagi worse for me since im from India (but grew up here ever since i was an infant) so ye have faced alotta internal racism for being *too indian* if uk what i mean :c"
24603,yea i do think that singapore is pretty casually racist towards blacks as seen in how teens and my friends usually throw around the n word.
24604,then again i doubt their racism goes beyond that level to one seen in the usa right now.
24605,yea i reckon they might brush up on the stuff before VTL.
24606,"is like u see this racist incidents in singapore on the media, but in reality is not as prevalent as it seems."
24607,yea their racism is even written in the law (bumiputera policy).
24608,/s  the decision to reject all Indian tenants is just a result of racism breeding racism.
24609,"yea... but then after experiencing the racism abroad they get to come home here where they are safe  minority singaporeans – singaporean indians who are born here, serve NS, pay CPF, etc – son go missing still kena this kind of nonsense."
24610,Also imagine crying about minorities devaluing property (nice racism btw) in an increasingly unaffordable market lol...delusional mf
24611,yeah Im sure there are no racists in your home country lol
24612,"yeah I’ve been just doing that, just ignoring him but it also takes a toll on my mental health constantly being shouted at for stupid reasons and hearing him be blatantly racist and degrading, and I can’t even take it out on him because I feel bad to shout back at a grandparent."
24613,yeah banning live-in maids seems to be the appropriate step for moving towards the ideal.
24614,"while i disagree with the woman’s lumping together of this incident with other, more serious and explicitly racist incidents, i gotta say that the gov and related orgs shld rly stop with the know-it-all behaviour."
24615,yeah he’s a racist    He did nothing against a minister who said little India was dark due to skin color of Indians   He also said sg wouldn’t have survived if there were many Indians or made up of Indians fully vs Chinese
24616,maids are only entitled to one day off a week and many of them choose to forgo that day for extra cash.
24617,we really need better laws and regulation for foreign domestic workers.
24618,"its not racist with an ‘a’ at the back, i dont mean it as racist so therefore its not racist, etc."
24619,in my eyes its more of a pride thing for them bc they dont wanna be seen as racist / wrong.
24620,"racism is racism, full stop."
24621,yeah so those chinese people that you are talking about are xenophobic.
24622,THAT is racism.
24623,"when people in school call indians bad names, make fun of their skin colour and “stink”, THAT is racism."
24624,"when people say that all malays are lazy, THAT is racism."
24625,"when people can’t get jobs (that don’t require mandarin proficiency) because the jobs are reserved for chinese people, THAT is racism."
24626,"When people can’t rent apartments because the owner doesn’t want indian people in their houses, THAT is racism."
24627,Singapore is a cesspool for casual racism and to state otherwise would be ignorant.
24628,Half the people don’t even know that they are making racist or discriminatory statements.
24629,yeah so to my original comment: basically everyone coming in (without VTL) goes into quarantine
24630,yeah tend to agree with u. another way to see it - if u like the expat lifestyle HK is actually better
24631,yeah the govt is pretty racist in terms of policy.
24632,"yeah the thinking is probably ""air travellers already pay $XXX for their flights, a $100+ PCR test is fine, but for land VTL the $100+ PCR is too expensive"""
24633,"Anyway appreciate you taking the time to type out this response, at the end of the day I do hope we address this FT issue in a proper manner (I'm hopeful government will take measured steps and not knee jerk) and then we can get to the meat and bones of addressing the underlying racism issue without this hot button topic getting in the way."
24634,yeah we just had that one case whereby the employer just starved and brutalized the maid to her death..
24635,"yeah whats the point of this anyway, if the maid is pregnant, it'd be easy to tell after 6 months without a test anyway"
24636,Please stop calling him racist.
24637,"if you're going to say something to downright stupid and racist, be prepared to face pushback."
24638,"yeah, i understand - in terms of size definitely S pass / work permit more than expats."
24639,"maybe better to further categorize the kinds of foreigners (there was a comment that did this i think) because i'm quite sure expats are damn expensive (not for no good reason though, since they have skills that locals don't)..."
24640,"yeah, you can already see it all over r/singapore, how much of it is true xenophobia or a brittle ego however, probably 50/50"
24641,"to quote the avenue Q song - ""everyone's a little bit racist""."
24642,"it may not be healthy, but it's everywhere and as long as humans exist, racism will stay."
24643,too many employers don't even see their maids as human.
24644,source: worked for MOM foreign domestic worker hotline for a few months.
24645,"I gave a hypothetical example where someone said something that was clearly racist, and then I said that to dismiss THOSE concerns would be racist."
24646,"I wasn't saying that what amrin himself has said was racist (although I /did/ use his words that labelled the victim a snowflake, in my hypothetical eg)  and I didn't call for the victim to judge the perpetrator."
24647,"not who should judge who, and not what the judgement of whether this incident was racist or not, is."
24648,You can’t just compare working in an office and being a domestic helper
24649,"therefore, when it comes to the demographic of senior roles in MNCs that are most importantly well-paying, the expectation is that locals should make up a supermajority of that, the main reason being that as long as there are locals qualified for the role, there should be priority for them over expats."
24650,"this and many other reasons, including recovery from economic depression, increasing nationalistic/decreasing globalistic policies etc only further exacerbates singapore's underlying xenophobia."
24651,yes you can after UAE becomes a VTL country in December.
24652,the persons limited exposure will lend itself to future cases of stereotyping and racism.
24653,"but the point is, it is important to understand the context, before throwing words like “racist” around."
24654,it’s easy to be politically correct and witch hunt although most cases turn out to be true racism anyway...
24655,"yes,  We cannot say: "" Hey stop racisms !"""
24656,"But it is important to acknowledge that it is an issue, and call people out, even if they're your friends when they have microagressive tendencies or just straight up being a racist."
24657,"Most Singaporeans are not racist, but have microagressive tendencies, even if they're unconscious bias, and this is why we need to have conversations about it upfront instead of avoiding the topic altogether."
24658,"If it can be established that Singapore is becoming xenophobic, the next question should be WHY."
24659,"Subsequently, a proper discourse can take place with the objective of easing these pressures and thus reducing irrational xenophobia."
24660,"yes, i have - friend had a maid whom she treated really well but somehow the maid eventually went rogue and had to be sent back :/"
24661,"So it is okay for india to embrace hindutva policies, but when a Singaporean decides to embrace Singaporean first policies, we are racist and wrong."
24662,"but unfortunately ""data on the total number of LTVP holders is not publicly available"" according to [this](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-maids-foreign-family-members-of-citizens-in-singapore) article."
24663,hint: illegal immigrants
24664,maid suffers and these jokers really get away with it
24665,"you could just get an ART(according to the SQ website) + with VTL, you only need 2 tests when coming back."
24666,you are lucky with your maid.
24667,"it doesn’t mean that it is right for parents to overload their maid with child caregiving, on top of their existing household chores."
24668,most maids in my experience are not this talented.
24669,i feel more sgreans should try to think for the maids.
24670,"most maids are youths or young adults themselves, coming from a village to work in a strange city, living with employers who speak in different language."
24671,"most maids are not trained to take care of infants, so just let them do the chores, that’s quite a load of your backs."
24672,"for folks who employ maid because u have an infant: a maid only cost a only fraction of your monthly salaries, doesn’t mean it is right to treat her a fraction of a person."
24673,"infant is yours, not the maid’s."
24674,you are right to say the cancellation of VTL will not be immediate.
24675,is he racist?
24676,"they shouldn't be hiring in singapore if the same result can be achieved elsewhere for a lower cost, especially if most of the hiring they are doing here is of foreign workers anyway."
24677,you can hardly compare foreign student and migrant worker living conditions
24678,you can if you are racist
24679,"you can rent an entire 4/5 room hdb, 2.6k is abit paltry for expats though"
24680,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-singapore-migrants/migrant-workers-fear-massive-singapore-dormitory-lockdown-is-coronavirus-time-bomb-idUSKBN21O138
24681,"the migrant workers, all of which under isolation"
24682,"you have the audacity to defend the idea that being called ang moh is even minutely comparable to the effects of institutionalized racism minorities in sg face  look, you don’t really care about this racial conversation and neither does it have any significant, generational effect on you, your children, or your community."
24683,that’s why you still live in relative comfort while our indian/bangladeshi/filipino/indonesian/etc foreign migrant workers live in decrepit conditions.
24684,you have to stay for 14 days in the country before embarking on the VTL to another country.
24685,you guys dont know how racism affects someone.
24686,racism was everywhere from primary school to secondary school to poly.
24687,"i think to end racism, you have to find accept the existence of racism instead of people saying things like “oh this isnt racist or this isnt racism”"
24688,"you knew that, why didn't you take the VTL then ?"
24689,i certainly can’t imagine being a maid myself.
24690,"you’re right, i don’t think anyone would _dream_ of being a maid."
24691,"you missed the point, the reply brought up these topics to show sg govt has indeed behaved erratically, with their roti prata stance and whatever else, hence not entirely unbelievable that high earning expats could be overlooked/passed over in terms of pr status."
24692,you should ask the CEO of racism to resign
24693,"you will be exempted from mother tongue language education or you could study a foreign language like japanese, french or german."
24694,you'd think that way but then almost all expat families I know from developed countries (especially those with young child) in Singapore have hired helpers.
24695,"cheese), so expat go there from their home country's stuff."
24696,you're only nice to maids because you don't want your throat to get slit?
24697,"you're speaking of ideals, which I'm fond of too :) i think when you allow such a maid system, it becomes so ingrained like welfare or min."
24698,"But if 50% of maids are ill-treated, is the G willing to put these employers on a ban list?"
24699,This lady & whatever household she's living in should not be allowed to employ a maid for at least 5 years.
24700,We're also ignoring the fact that many maids cause trouble and being strict is one way to prevent such.
24701,"The fear of the maid running away, getting pregnant, stealing your property or worse injuring your child."
24702,Then you have the rare cases of maids murdering their employers which surely freaks any employer into certain measures.
24703,"Another factor is often when treated nicely, maids slack off and start coming up with demands."
24704,If we are appalled by the treatment many maids get here.
24705,"At least for maids, their family benefit to some degree."
24706,Or do we focus on the maid issue because we know domestic sexual abuse of kids here is an even harder problem to tackle?
24707,"your flair contradicts what you are trying to do here, also look up the word xenophobia."
24708,your maid may come from a 3rd world country but you really have a 4th world mindset .
24709,yup lots of hk expats clamouring to transfer here.
24710,"yup, casual racism is racism."
24711,Today we did the supervised covid test (VTL) and we both are negative.
24712,"| the blogger listed five ways for xenophobic Singaporeans to express their displeasure at the presence of Filipinos in Singapore, one of which was refusing to be served by Filipino waitresses at restaurants."
24713,"~~From what I've seen actually, property agents are just a front for the wishes of the landlord without the landlord appearing racist themselves."
24714,"I've had heart to heart conversations with some of these agents who exclude Indians, mostly to find out the landlords are extremely racist.~~  ~~Young agents especially, are quite unbiased.~~  Edit- Out of context"
24715,~~Maid~~ FDW is part of the family in the majority of our homes.
24716,"Yes, there are horrible examples of employers and FDW but typical family relies on them and treat them quite ok."
24717,You will join the racists side?
24718,‘maids are never treated as an equal’...I guess there is nothing more to say.
24719,Isn’t that what caused racism in the first place?
24720,“CECA does not allow the free movement of natural persons (i.e.
